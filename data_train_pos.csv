"It's nice to have this place in the west village. Cozy, authentic and delicious hot pots. My only critique is if you order Raman expect dry packaged noodles added to your hot pot, not authentic fresh noodles. Service is friendly. And lastly, although widely known for pig feet, save your money unless you want to taste some serious animal cartilage. I'm an adventurous eater but I could have gone without that. Oh, and get the tuna tartare and the crispy chicken wings. DELISH!"
"yum, would def go back here again. Â the sangria blanca was delicious! Â plus, it was served in a gigantic glass. Â my friend ordered the baby back ribs, which were amazing, especially with the mexican corn and sweet potato fries, mm still thinking about the food. Â my bistec was really good, i substituted the tomato watercress salad Â with spinach, which the waiter suggested, and everything was delicious! Â want to come back here for brunch and try that with the unlimited sangria now :)"
"Okay... I'm the 3092th person to rate this place... Â this place gets lot of traffic. No, it's not rubber-necking or accident... but congestion due to sheer volume. The staff was efficient and nice. Once we actually got to our seat, the water came within seconds. The waiter came for the drink order in a about a hot minute. Gave us about 5 minutes for the dinner menu. Pork buns came out about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. Ramen almost immediately after our empty pork bun dish was removed. To rate the food itself... it's a 4. You know... i preferred the pork buns from momofuku. The service i think may deserve a 5. But the wait.... oh ... the wait... Got there are 5:45. Left our name. Called around 7:20. Host recommended we come back. Waited on line to tell him we're back. Waited about 5 minutes until they called our name. By the time we were ordering our dinner... 8:00. 5:45 to 8:00PM!!! (Oh yeah, the host said 3 hour wait when we first walked in... but i thought, seriously?!?! 3 hours. can't be ... let's try) Granted it was Saturday night but NO! No food is worth that much waiting... unless I'm cooking, which in that case I'm multi-tasking. Not loitering around union square to kill time. My recommendation. Never had it before? Go... make the trip. Enjoy the adventure. Make sure you get there when you're not hungry so you can beat the ridiculous line. Would i go again...NEVER AGAIN. fun fact: supposedly this place is a chain in Japan. If i ever make it out to Japan... I'll try it there. I'm hoping the lines are shorter."
"uh yea...let me put it to you this way...If I hit up an ""authentic"" italian resto and the ratio of indians/hispanics/scandanavians to italians is 50:50, I'm outtie...sooo outtie so when I entered this joint and was surrounded by asians (slanted-eyed asians, to be more specific)...I knew this was gonna be the shiz-fuckin-nit I was delerious taking down everything from grilled lamb chops to an avocado salad to terriyaki squid to beef tongue to chicken meatballs to the waitresses' fingers...all while drunk on sapporo draught beers So what if I stiff-shouldered every tourist in Times Square to get here....it was worth it... ...and it took a white broad to convince me this spot was better than both the yakitori/izakaya joints on st. mark's place...you were right, Darcy."
"To keep things short, what makes me give this place a 2 is the prices. We liked the concept of this place and wanted to make it work but at a price of 40 bucks a head it just isn't worth it. How can 4 chickpea fries be 6 dollars? Or 6 tater tots be 4 dollars? Ask the redhead...southern food should be comforting, not break the bank."
"Balls, balls, balls of meat! Sweet, juicy, salty, spicy, savory, plump, succulent BAWLS...of meat. So let's start with ordering, you gotta decide on how you want your balls. Do you want in between buns? by themselves w/ a slice of bread, over a bed of vegetables, or covered in cheese, sauce, and baked. Best balls on the menu for me would have to be the classic beef, spicy pork, and their lamb (which was a daily special I believe). Seriously, all the balls are amazing no matter if it's beef balls, pork balls, lamb balls, or even chicken balls. All the balls are super juicy. Like the juices just overflow out of the balls as soon as you bite into them. Great flavor, seasoned very well, no boring balls here! Some of my favorite sauces were classic tomato (if you wanna do spaghetti & meatballs route), mushroom gravy (loved this over the Everything But The Kitchen Sink salad), the Parmesan cream (so rich and creamy, great cheese flavor), and the spicy meat sauce (extra meat over meatballs? uhh Heaven yes!). So those are a few of my favorite sauces for the balls, incidentally those are also all the sauce choices on the menu for their balls. So the bottom line? All the sauces are bomb dot com. Their sides are really good too! We ordered the polenta and the risotto. Both were delicious but when I placed some of my spicy pork meatballs with the mushroom gravy sauce over the risotto? GAME OVER! Orgasm in my mouf! Then ate the remaining risotto with the classic beef ball & Parmesan cream sauce? DOUBLE GAME OVER! So game started? MULTIPLE ORGASMS IN MY MOUF! So do you want your mouth to have a mouthgasm(s)? Then come down to the Meatball Shop and stuff their balls into your mouth, PRONTO! Their unofficial slogan is ""Put these balls in yo mouf"" I believe."
"HOLY COW This place is...is... amazing. To be honest this was my first ever Greek Restaurant in the states. I've eaten greek food, visited Greece and eaten at restaurants there, but this surpassed my expectations. When I first walked in, the place looked a bit small, but once you walk across the bar/ bunch of tables to the host podium you can see that there is an entire other part of the restaurant. The place is pretty big and I really love the decor. Tasteful and sophisticated, complementing Greek art (lots of blue) while not being tacky. The food, oh the food. We started with the Sweetbreads, Spinach, Crispy Shallot, Garlic appetizer. Totally not what I had expected-it was phenomenal. So full of flavor I ended taking the bread that they put on the table and soaking it in the dish to get every last drop of the broth. I stuck with something traditional for dinner the Chicken Souvlaki and it was heavenly. The pita bread was so fresh and soft. It was served with these home-made salted potato chips which I kept dunking in the Tzatziki sauce as if it was a dip. Staff is very friendly and will be definitely be going back!"
"If you are a brunch lover... You will really enjoy Isabella's! The restaurant itself is adorable! From the wicker seats and white table cloths to the high ceilings and large windows and warm lighting... a perfect place to go for a nice brunch with friends or family. The staff was fantastic... helpful, friendly, and they didn't loom at all. To me, the key to a good brunch outing is being able to sit and relax and chat... If there is one thing I cant stand, its restaurant staff that tossed the check at you and pretty much looms until you pay and leave. But not here... a perfect place for some good food and drinks and to chat with friends! And I really love the fact that despite its close location to the Museum, its not SWARMING with tourists. Maybe a few out of town-ers here and there... but generally a nice, quiet place. I recommend trying to get a seat by the window on a nice day... not outside.. and not deep inside. Sitting on the edge of the window is PERFECT. Outside, the cars and foot traffic is a little too close for my taste.. and inside is probably nicer during the evening. And the crab cake burger... AMAZING! I'll definitely be back! Thanks for the wonderful brunch Isabella's! I have a new favorite destination on the west side!"
"We came around midnight on a Sunday, probably not the typical time most people come to this place, but we also ran into a famous dancer there and got a picture (who apparently frequents the place often). The crowd varied from students chilling with their classmates/friends to older couples enjoying a romantic cup of coffee and dessert by candlelight to fabulously gay cliques gossiping over appetizers. Â Great warm service from our waiter who chatted with us and now knows all of our names by heart. I debated among the latte with almond/vanilla, the steam milk with almod/vanilla, or the chai tea latte. Â I went with the chai tea latte and was thoroughly satisfied."
"Pretty good but not GREAT pizza. Â Crispy, which is a perk. Â They think the world of themselves and you get the impression they are doing you a favor by feeding you their pizza. Â Very overpriced. I get it, you are the first pizzeria in the US. Â But you are not the best, sorry. Â  Cash only also bugs me since if you charge that much at least let me use the card, who carries so much cash these days?!?! Â Again the pizza was crispy and good but just not the best ever."
"Man, is this place fun. Frito pie, free cheeseballs, chili cheese dogs and drinks made with Gatorade?! Yes. It's true. The Levee is cheap, has pretty decent food (tho I was sad the bun on my chili cheese dog was not toasted) and they have the Dreamsicle. That is orange soda and vanilla vodka and it is as delicious as it sounds. Comes in a pint glass, drinks like candy...basically trouble in a glass. They also have great shot and beer combos (I particularly liked the Lonestar + shot of tequila combo...yum). I will be going back here frequently and staying forever. The area around the bar is pretty crowded but there are seats in the back and tons of board games. Watch out on those Dreamsicles tho, I had a hell of a headache the next morning. Yeah, must have been the soda...not the 5 drinks."
"can't believe i haven't written a review for corner bistro yet~! been here a few times - place is known for their burgers. loooved living in the w.village, where this place was walking distance. open late. cheeseburgers are orgasmic. my gf got the bistro burger (w/bacon) no frills type of place. *2 thumbs up* you won't be disappointed!"
"LOVE the new space. It wasn't too overly packed when I came in for my weekly grit fix. Gets tight when a few people are waiting and that was just about 6 of us. Oh well. It's worth it for the deliciousness that awaits my tastebuds. The squash, egg & avocado combo really is sublime."
"Went here early Friday afternoon with a friend an exhausted toddler sleeping in the stroller. Place is small but not stuffy. Don't care much for the decor. Place was obviously not yet packed since we were there for very early fibber. So we got prime seating to allow for safe stroller parking inside. I had a craving for arepas, so I got the arepa de chocolo (a sweet yellow corn meal cake toasted with butter) topped with chorizo and guacamole... Delish. It had the right amount of sweetness and cooked to perfection. I also had their goat cheese and beef empanadas. The casing of each empanadas were unique, which complemented the stuffing inside. Certain times the empanadas are 3 dollars each if ordered at the bar. Very good deal. Wish I knew sooner cause the empanadas were amazing. So amazing that I took 4 home. They has a special 4 empanadas for $12 to go. Also the empanadas came with its own unique dipping sauce to compliment. For drinks I had the guava mojito. I can taste the freshness of the herbs used to make this one hell of a drink, Definitely coming back. Such great food and the service was also very good."
Delicious! Duck and Fois ravioli were perfect. The bar is nicely stocked with Carpano sweet vermouth and Lazzaroni Amaretto.
"Came here with my family because Ippudo was a 2 hour wait on a Friday at 6pm, and this place was tucked in an alley, but the Italian food here was no joke. The bread was very warm and the pasta was fresh! My family ordered the pate as a starter and that was Uh-mazing! The pate was so flavorful and the marmalade to accompany it made the croustini pop in your mouth, with a sweet and savory bite. I def recommend ordering that! For my main entree I ordered the pasta with lamb and the pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and it was made fresh! Not many places can say they do this. I also tried the Prosciutto and Arugola pizza and the crust was perfectly cooked and the pizza was so flavorful! This place was a small quaint place, but well worth it. The service was good and the food was even better, what more could you ask for?"
"Going to the big apple without eating some NY thin crust pizza is like going out of the house without any shoes on. It's only necessary. After making reservations two weeks in advance and being half an hour late, Rubirosa was kind enough to still accommodate us. The receptionist graciously led us to our table at the back of the narrow and dimly lit restaurant. Wood furnishings all throughout and a rustic atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in a tavern gave off this warm yet vibrant energy. We kicked off our meal with their CALAMARI FRITTI ($12). It wasn't overly coated which I like, plus the breading stuck well to the squid and didn't crumble easily. It was delicious but, I normally prefer garlic aioli for dipping and they didn't have that. Marinara sauce it is. On the positive side, the mixed-in zucchini fritti was a pleasant surprise to find in the bunch. MINI RICE BALLS ($11) was something new and unique to me. I had doubts when we ordered this but after trying it, I was glad we did. Imagine risotto with mascarpone, prosciutto, and fontina rolled into a ball, then covered in this well-seasoned batter, and finally fried. It comes with a marinara dip so douse it nice and well, then take a bite...mmhmm...amazeballs! Caution: hot rice inside. For the main show, we got a large pizza with half RUBIROSA SUPREME and half VODKA ($28). The supreme had tomato sauce, mozzarella, mini meatballs, pepperoni, and garlic. Each ingredient cooperated harmoniously and brought about a very meaty and tasty pizza. Special thanks to the garlic for vamping up the flavor intensity of this pie, and a noteworthy mention of the thin crust that had the right thinness, flakiness, and chewiness. Va bene! Now, let's not forget the other half that made this pizza whole. The vodka sauce and fresh mozzarella sounds relatively simple but don't be fooled because this was as flavorful as the supreme, sans the meat. I'm glad we got this instead of the BIANCA as that one was more like a dry white pizza, while this had a tomato-based sauce. For a party of 3, I couldn't be more pleased with the two halves we chose. With 8 slices for a large pie and the two apps, not to mention the glasses of wine and beer we had, we may as well have been rolled out of there like barrels. We were too stuffed to move. The smaller size of 6 slices would've been enough. Anyhow, thanks to our awesome server for doting on us the entire night!"
"These noodles were featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. Â They are most definitely hand-pulled on the premises. Â What sounds like a face-pounding in the kitchen is actually the noodles smacking against the table as they are pulled and twisted. Â Very loudly. Â While a bit distracting to diners, it at least offers some comfort in knowing the noodles are super fresh. Â I would have loved to watch the action, but our table was no where near the entrance to the kitchen, so no peeking for us! We both chose to have the hand-pulled noodles in soup, as opposed to one of the stir-fried options. Â My friend had hers with the pork-stuffed fish balls, and I had roasted duck. Â The noodles were incredibly chewy, thick, and tasty. Â I LOVED the texture, and I loved how when looking at the noodles they were all ever-so-slightly different thicknesses and not perfectly even, a testament to how hand-made they are. Â The broth was also tasty and somewhat rich, with the addition of fresh spinach and scallions to add some brightness and to balance out richer flavors in the soup. Â Free tea also helped cut some of the richness of our meal. Â The fish balls were really interesting. Â I had never had them before, but I honestly really enjoyed it. Â The fish exterior was not very fishy at all, and the pork filling added just a nice bit of meatiness. Â Although it sounds kind of weird, it's not really. Â The roast duck was okay. Â The pieces were all on the bone, which made it a little difficult to eat with chopsticks, and the once-crispy skin was now soggy in the broth. Â The meat itself was moist and tasty, but I probably wouldn't choose the duck next time. My only complaint is that there was practically no service to speak of. Â We were handed menus, and then someone came and took them away before they ever took our order. Â We then had to ask for them to give us new menus. Â Later I asked for water, and the waitress never returned. Â Never. Â And it's a tiny restaurant, you can't really hide. Â We had to just grab a bottled water out of the cooler so I could have something to drink other than tea, and then of course pay for it. Â Fortunately it was only $1, but still. Â You definitely come here for the food and NOT the service."
"Had lunch here, the place Â was packed. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, the shrimp and watercress dumplings, Szechuan wontons, and chicken pan fried noodles. The food was really good, the wontons were fantastic. The shrimp watercress dumpling and panfried noodles were great. I don't think the soup dumplings here are better then Â joes. I did like the think skin, but I like the broth better at the joes. The place is clean, staff nice, and they don't rush you out. I like this place a lot."
"I don't know why it is, but I seem to gravitate towards places that are named Eddy. I used to volunteer at a school on an Eddy Street, I lived on a different Eddy Street during the last half of college, and there's now a wonderful bar (yelp.com/biz/the-eddy-pr...) in my hometown. Then there's this bar restaurant in the East Village. And I've had nothing but good memories in each. On the night we went, there were more people sitting in the dining area, so we were lucky when we were seated at a quiet corner table in the bar area. Being the sister restaurant of Wallflower, we were very excited to try their cocktails. I know it's not good to judge books by their covers (in this case, drinks by their names), but when I saw names like the 7th Regiment Punch and Gandy Dancer on their list, I already knew we'd be in for a treat. The 7th Regiment Punch (because it had Napoleon Armagnac in it!) was very fruity and came presented as a pink (because of the raspberry cordial and saffron sherbet) drink in a teacup. J's Frances the Mute contained coffee whiskey, sherry, amaro, and a whole egg stirred in, and was refined and delicious. We ordered from the a la carte menu. 1. Bacon Tater Tots - These were delicious, and the bright green dot of pea purÃ©e was a fresh addition (both visually and in taste), though I found the mustard each tater tot rested on a little too strong. 2. Burrata with delicata - My favorite. I didn't even know what delicata was before I sat down, but learned that it's a type of squash that's even richer and creamier than butternut! I honestly learn a new vocabulary word every single time I dine out. The burrata was fluffy and delicious with the vinaigrette and greens. 3. Ricotta gnocchi with oyster mushrooms - The plate was fairly small, but the gnocchi was pillowy, the oyster mushrooms juicy, and the hazelnuts pleasant. 4. Ribeye with St. Albray fondue and crushed potatoes - The fondue was just bits of melted cheese that rested on top of the dish, but they were deliciously creamy and salty. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and went well with the well-seasoned potatoes. It was a very comforting, hearty dish. Â We made it a point to have each forkful contain all three elements. The service was impeccable. Our server came by and periodically asked us if we were enjoying everything. It wasn't like he was asking because he was supposed to, or asking because he knew the answer; he just genuinely seemed to care about our thoughts. I really appreciated that. Likelihood of another visit: I'd even like to come back to try more of the drinks."
"Very high quality Neopolitan pies being dispensed here. My girlfriend and I took 2 pies out last night, a margherita and a meatball. Both were well charred and had high quality ingredients. Our only complaint was the skimpiness of the meatballs, at $4 you'd hope for more meatballs, but still it was delicious. It's as good as anywhere in Manhattan and it's much closer to our place so we'll be coming back for more."
"Came here and was so happy we chose this place again. Sat in the back, which I think is the best place to sit. The food is delicious, great wine choices, such good desserts. The servers were knowledgeable and efficient. We'll be back!"
"Interesting. If you have had a stressful day at work with the fellas and you want to go someplace and feel like your hard earned dollar really equates to you being a cultured debutante...head here with your work chums. Whiskey out the ears. You'll have so many whiskey options it'll remind you of your drunken co-ed days. You know, dancing on tables, hot-wiring cop cars, needing your stomach pumped. Just kidding. My how far we have come! Just sip and enjoy. You know, swirl the whiskey around in your glass. No one else knows what they're doing. Fake it til you make it! But seriously, so many whiskey options. Who knew? I liked their mixed drinks. I got the Jamaican Ting. It was great. They also had hot toddy, which smelled amazing. The small plates were interesting. I didn't think they were anything to write home about (maybe because my mind was going WHISKEY WHISKEY SOPHOMORE YEAR OH NO)...they were interesting, but seemed to dig into every culinary trend out there right now. The beef tartare was good. But what girl can say no to a huge plate of raw meat, wink wink. Ahem, sorry (told you sophomore year was crazy jk jk jk). The poached egg with grits was tasty. We were all devouring those free biscuits that they kept bringing over. Now those were delicious. Eat about 3 of those per whiskey drink and then say goodbye to any possibility of a hangover. Smoke a cigar outside of this place and you'll pretty much exude Dick Tracey confidence and panache. Honestly, I'm not sure if this place really appeals to chicks. I don't know many girls that like whiskey. However, again, if you want a boys night out, this is the place!"
"I. LOVE. Â THIS. Â PLACE. I first started coming here a few years ago via a recommendation from a grad school classmate. Â Since then, I have recommended it to a lot of people, and they have all been pleased (it's the gift that keeps on giving!). Â The Red Sangria is the best I've ever had. Â So tasty, so consistent over time. Â It is pretty strong, too. Â You don't taste the strength, which means its very well made. Â My husband's tried the margaritas here, too, and really liked those. Honestly, all the food is good here. Â The taquitos are tasty. Â The shrimp ceviche is very refreshing to start with. Â I've never been unhappy with anything I've eaten here over the years. Â The Churrasco is my most recent discovery here, and it was extremely flavorful. Â The service is impeccable. Just note that it's a small place and fills up fast. Â The drinks are so good that the bar area (which is tiny) can be a tight fit, but it's worth it after you try the sangria (enough of it and you won't mind it so much :) Â ). Â They don't take reservations, but it's worth the wait!"
"It's more of a 4.5 stars, but only because it was so loud I literally had to shout through the entire dinner. I've been trying to make reservations for this place several times, but each time, it was too last minute and they were completely booked. Finally, I made a reservation for a Tuesday dinner 4 days in advance (which was plenty) for 6 people. They wouldn't seat us until most of our party had arrived (5 people) and I don't blame them for that. One of my friend's spoke Spanish and immediately the waiter warmed up to our table. He was very friendly throughout the evening. Although he wasn't constantly checking up on us, there were enough staff around to make sure everyone's needs were met. In fact, by the end I got confused as to who our waiter even was since so many different people came around. On to the food: It was delicious! This is my first time eating Peruvian food and omg I stuffed myself. For our party of 6, we ordered 2 ceviches ($18 each) -- the lemon and saltado. Both were very very good, though I think the general consensus was that the saltado was slightly better. Then for the main course we ordered the Matador combo ($38), which comes with the chicken, the rice/beans, fries/sausage, and the avocado salad. When I was reading the reviews about the ""green sauce"" I was looking forward to trying it.. The reviews don't lie. The green sauce literally makes everything taste infinitely better. The fries/sausage was average, as were the rice/beans. The avocado salad was really fresh! We also ordered the Paella ($30), which was probably my favorite dish! It was super savory and super good. There was even a huge shrimp in it. And lastly, we ordered the Tacu Tacu ($30). Loved the dish, full of carbs, but the flavoring/seasoning was spot on. The 6 of us were, to say the least, stuffed by the end of the meal. But still, gotta order dessert right? We ordered the Tres Leches ($8) for 6 people to share.. it was enough for like 2 spoonfuls per person, which honestly was fine with us. The first bite is always the best! It was super duper good and I would highly recommend it. All in all, the entire evening, everyone was very pleased. Even though our food took quite some time to come out (~40minutes), it was all worth it!! The bill came out to be $210 including tax and tip, which isn't too given how much we ate and how satisfied we were. I'll definitely be coming back here again!!"
Always go there for mixed soondubu and LA galbi. Also love their clam soup! Best tofu soup in ktown.
"Over a year since my last visit, and still a great option! Menu items changed which was nice to see. Can't get over how affordable it is while still serving fantastic food in a relaxed atmosphere. Started wit the artichoke ravioli and the chilled soup of the day. Both were spot on - great appetizer options. For my entree I had the sea scallops. Perfectly cooked with a slight crisp on the outside and smooth and buttery on the inside. Served with a poblano pepper sauce. Love the mexican influence! A great neighborhood joint!"
"I really don't understand what's the hype with this place. I came here on a random weekday, like a Wednesday or Thursday night and the wait was an hour long. I was fine with the wait, wondered around St Marks and came back in an hour. There was literally no sense of customer service with the waitress quickly coming to you to get your order and never to be seen again. The ramen was slightly better than average, but not really worth the wait time or the price. The pork buns were good, but again, nothing outstanding. The whole time I felt like it was a food court rather than a restaurant due to the lack of service and at the same time it felt like they were eyeing you to leave because of everyone else waiting outside."
"I came here with a friend for restaurant week. Â First off, the service here was great. Â We were greeted so warmly by the host and the servers were very friendly and so accommodating. Â The space is a little small, but I loved the ambiance. Â It's dark and cozy, but the bar is bright and lit up. Â I'd say the dress code was upscale casual; my friend and I were heading out after dinner and we didn't feel overdressed. Â In my opinion, their restaurant week menu had some of the best items compared to many of the other restaurants listed. Â I decided on the fish tacos, the skirt steak and the almond quinoa cake. Â The portion sizes were perfect and I was able to enjoy everything without getting overly full. Â The fish tacos were my favorite. Â The fish was cooked perfectly and they were just spicy enough. Â Skirt steak was delicious as well and cooked exactly how I asked for it. Â I'm not a huge fan of dessert, and the quinoa cake was perfect and not overly sweet. Â We ordered a few drinks off the cocktail menu, but decided on one of their $25 bottles of wine towards the end of our meal. Â Our server made sure our glasses were never empty. Â Our experience at Yerba Buena was great and the food was excellent! Â I can't wait to try their brunch and will definitely be back for dinner."
"Get the Viagra empanada..shrimp, crab and scallops..flavors just pop. It's the best seller."
The menu is small and everything is good but you don't need all of that. What you need is a biscuit with honey. In fact that may be all you need from here and in life.
"I came here with a few friends to enjoy a Saturday afternoon in LIC. It drew us in with its brunch specials ($6 for a mimosa or bloody mary and $3 for refills) and cozy atmosphere. The space itself was decorated subtly for Halloween. There were a few spider webs on the ceiling that were not overpowering and didn't take away from the charm of the space. The dining area is not very big, but comfortable for a small group (I was with 3 other people). The waitress seated us quickly with a friendly attitude. We had a few questions about the menu. She had good knowledge of the items and Â offered her own suggestions. Our food came out rather quickly. I had the veggie burger with truffle fries. The veggie burger came with avocado and a curry sauce on the side. The curry sauce was good but the burger itself could have used a bit more seasoning. Overall, not bad, but I will probably try a different item next time. The truffle fries were very tasty. I could have eaten those all day and been perfectly content with life. The prices are very reasonable. The veggie burger with fries was only $12 and with the brunch special for mimosas, my meal was just about $20. A good place to have a lazy brunch."
"It's true that you have to prepare yourself a little to go here. I've been a couple of times and there is always a crowd and it's a little bit of a scene, but the drinks at the bar are always great so long as you don't mind wedging yourself in a bit, and we've even had our appetizers there while we wait. The pork belly buns are to die for. Fresh butter lettuce and Japanese mayo are a perfect compliment to the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly tucked inside a cloudlike bun. The Harata Wings are also a big winner. I would love to try everything on their menu, given adequate time and funds. The ramen is excellent, although the portion is always more than I can finish (I guess that's a good complaint to have versus the opposite). I look forward to my next visit!"
Sat at the bar bc inside looked jammed. Got perilla 75 drink to start off. It was sÃ¼ber nice. Then I ordered the restaurant week menu and got the chicken and mussels salad. The chicken was sooooo nice my bf kept stealing it. He said it was the best chicken he ever had besides himself. I had a hard time telling which was better between him and this chicken. I would totally come back here again.
"I came through here during lunch time in a rush to get in-and-out to catch a flight. Â Walking in the place seems very busy even when it isn't too full. Â It reminds me of the little hole-in-the-wall places I would eat at during my travels in Asia. There is a seating area up front, and another at the back of the store. Â In the middle is where you will find the goods. Â There is a hot food section where you can chose a plate or a to-go box and fill as you please with what you please. Â They also have pre-boxed lunches that you can grab, pay, and go with. Â If you did chose to load up your own plate/box then when you reach the counter they weigh your food and you pay by the ounce. Â They also have their various sides prepackaged for purchase as well, which can be found at the back-end of the hot food line. The selection was pretty wide, the price was a bit high, and the food was ok. Â I'd probably go back to try some sides, different hot foods, or their pre-boxed meals -- but after my first experience I'm keep my expectations right where they are."
"Go. Here. Now! I finally made my trek to Rincon Criollo in Corona last night (per Judy K's rec... yes, it's official... I ONLY go to Judy K-approved restaurants... [guilty smile] I mean come on', she did get Yelp ROTD!), and I was pleasantly surprised. This part of Queens has a ton of good Latin food (Dominican, Ecuadorian, Colombian, Mexican) but Cuban is one that is less represented. Rincon Criollo represents the Caribbean cuisine in its full glory. First of of all, the place is super old school. Waiters wear black pants and black leather vests. Walls are adorned with old photos, weird wood carvings of Latin American countries, and other kitsch oddities. A rickety ceiling fan runs slowly, conjuring up images of a lazy Cuban afternoon. The whole decor is more akin to a family restaurant than a hip or trendy place. And you know what, that's how it should be. In mean, a real restaurant in Cuba would most likely be a home-run speakeasy restaurant, or paladar. And like Rincon, it would most likely have a rickety ceiling fan, old photos on the wall, dim lighting, and unpretentious furnishings (sadly, it would also probably be way more run down, with only 10% of the offerings on the menu available because of food shortages, etc... but I am rambling). Anyhow, place: super family friendly and authentic. The food: truly amazing. I cut to the chase and ordered the ropa vieja, or shredded beef in red tomato sauce. Never have I had a more soft and succulent version of the dish. It tasted like... heavenly slow cooked beef. The tomato, onion, peppers and garlics were mere compliments, bathing the tender strands of shredded beef in their glory. The dish ($12) was complimented with my selection of two sides: sweet plantains, which were soft, sugary, and juicy, and moros y cristianos, or Cuba's version of black beans and rice all mixed together (spiked with a bit of lard or manteca I am sure). In one word: amazing. I sampled my wife's dishes too. Broiled flounder with white wine, butter, garlic and lemon was juicy and airy on the inside, browned and crunchy texture on the outside. Perfectly light and satisfying. Served with fried plantains -- crisp on the outside, warm and juicy on the inside -- and a warm, rich cup of black beans. For dessert, the restaurant gave us a small sampling of their house flan (on the house... these guys are so generous). I don't know what we were thinking before for trying to have a meal here and not order dessert. The flan was probably the best that I have ever had (and I have had homemade Cuban flan from the abuelita of my good friend). It was beyond rich and creamy, much less eggy than other flans, with a nice crunchy caramelized top. I am getting hungry just thinking about. Rincon is a gem in Queens, and it is well worth the foodie trek."
"At this place, it's all about the quality baguette, great head cheese, and great pate. Â This is a good hearty sandwich that will just make you happy from the inside out. Plus, the guys that work there are super friendly and fun. Â  Prices here are great for the fresh quality ingredients you get. Â The bread is always perfectly toasted. Â They have whole wheat baguette too, if you're feeling healthy. Â I always stick with the Super Cub Classic. Â It IS super classic, and it never disappoints. Â Especially if you don't skimp on the head cheese, pate, or hot sauce. Â Yum! Note that the restaurant is small and there are maybe only 5 counter seats. Â It's a quick eat & go type of place. Â Orders also take quick some time -- about 10-15 minutes for your order, whether you ordered 1 sandwich or 4. Â All that is totally worth it regardless. Â  Best banh mi in the city I think. Â Hands down. Â  But don't tell everyone i said that."
"Wandering around NYC, in search of a good burger and beer, we ended up at Mark on Yelp's recommendations. Â And we had a great time. No this isn't the place for everyone. Â There's a young crowd in this part of town and that's what you'll mostly find here. Â It's crowded, it's tight quarters, it's a little loud, but that's what we wanted on a Friday night. Â The sliders are priced well and are good -- you're getting a deal. Beer selection isn't overly extensive, but the ones on tap are good. Â And we had great service from an awesome waitress, but from the looks of it on yelp that can vary."
"Gyu-Kaku is popping up everywhere, and that's a good thing! When I lived in LA, I used to go to the one in Pasadena all the time. Their happy hour can't be beat. I was here visiting New York for several days and unfortunately it was pouring rain one of the days. We grabbed Shake Shack next door and came here for their happy hour and to watch the Lakers game. We ended up taking Patron shots (only $6!) on a Sunday afternoon."
"The PS1 museum food outlet has graduated over the years from a coffee kiosk to a coffee counter with sandwiches and muffins to an actual artsy cafe. Â  The idea to and success of the elevation alone is worth some kudos, however it's not performance art - it's food. Â  Being artsy, it comes across as perhaps a little wobbly (stoned) with the waitstaff smiling here more than any establishment I've recently set foot in in the New York metro area. Â My waiter, angelic, light footed with a very light brown eye, like a sleepy cool roommate, was incapable of dischord, strong on his own power and centered calm of self - perhaps cultivated in conjunction with regular weed use. Â  He recommended the skate wing pretty much singularly - and the other short menu items - pork chops - or oysters didn't seem as interesting as Id had hoped. The entree ($25) came out a wonderful tasty lump which I think was potatoes on top of the fish, the dish was not described to me. Â by the server attendant rock a billy chick who was as affable and mysterious if perhaps a bit more paranoid. The classroom set up was more like a bistro and the menu, handwritten in a school notebook was perhaps not as innovative or creative as it sounds. The desserts, a pear tart among them, sounded tempting, but I was stuffed. M wells might not be a destination yet, but if you're hungry while visiting this museum - m wells diner should hit the spot if you aren't on a budget. Lunch for one - around $30-$40 Wine and beer"
"I came here for the second time last week, and let me tell you - it was just as great as the first. I was remiss to not write a review the last time. The service is impeccable and friendly and just the right degree of attentive. Our waitress was spot-on with her wine suggestion (and introduced us to a new grape!). She had excellent takes on each dish and was able to really give us a great idea of what each one could offer according to our mood (!). And like before, Perilla delivered on each dish. The hangar steak, the brussel sprouts and the cous-cous dishes were my favorites. Really outstanding. And it was a special night for us with guests in town. This place is a complete winner. Thank you Perilla! You really made our evening."
"We had dinner here before Sleep No More and had an awesome meal! Decor: The whole place, from top to bottom, is set up as a '20's/'30's speakeasy. Not only is the decor spot-on but they also have actors/actresses, in character, walking around and dancing. It so cool. There is also a live band which was great! Staff: I have already mentioned the fun actors/actresses but everyone was very nice and friendly and quick with drinks/food/service. Top notch staff. Food/Drink: Everything was outstanding! We started with a few beers, which were nice and cold, and moved to an app: Mini Pork Pies (VERY good! but only three small bites). Then we had the Beef and Ale Pie (HUGE and very tasty) and the Benne Crusted Cod (perfectly cooked and delicious! the fries might be the best I have ever had). For dessert we enjoyed, very much enjoyed, the Neutella Icebox Tart (YUM). Everything was bursting with flavor and served piping hot. Value: While it is a bit pricey, it is well worth it. The food is exquisite and the decor/atmosphere is a huge bonus. I'm not sure if this place will close down when Sleep No More does in February (I'm assuming it will) but I already want to come back again for another meal."
"To be honest the decor is lovely, just a bit off the main street of boardway and Columbus Circle, on a small spot on the second floor. Â It's a small gem one would or could miss . Â Their food is decent however there is a minimum of $20. Easily their meals can equal that price but I dislike how it's mandatory. Â Their service was nice and I was very please at the presentation of food. Â Their corquette was one of the better ones I've had, Â and their silver fish Don is very well done. Â I personally loved the dessert choice of green tea argumon (spelled that wrong ) but it is very pleasant mix of red beans, mochi, and ice cream and then you would drizzle hot matcha green tea onto it. Â Very well done. It does get pricy because each sweker is 2 to 3 bucks and their aren't many entrÃ©es to pick from. Â So know that, Â But overall I can say the food is great, Â the service was excellent but I would not go there unless I had extra money and going with someone."
"The meat is excellent and delicious. The guys behind the counter are friendly. I love getting the combo sandwich to share with another person, makes an excellent meal. Ask for gravy on the side. So good. Rivals Katz' Deli any day -- and beats Katz for me because I live down the road and do not have to trek all the way to Manhattan for some good pastrami and cornbeef. YUM."
"I had high hopes given how popular this place is. The food is incredibly good and fresh, but there's nothing ""special"" about the menu. They do basic brunch items well. However, the food is pretty expensive (eg $20 for a Benedict? $17 for a breakfast platter?) and the wait is atrocious. We got there at 12:30pm on a Saturday and decided to wait out the 2.5 hour (!!!) wait (don't worry we filled our bellies with doughnut plan and sugar sweet sunshine bakery in the meantime). The Spanish scramble was good but pretty average. The farmers platter, on the other hand, was fantastic. The sausage, creamy eggs, and biscuit were yummy. Don't get me wrong... The food IS great but not great enough to drag me over from the other side of Manhattan and wait 2+ hours for. The prices are also too high for what I consider normal brunch items. Delicious food and friendly service definitely make this spot worth a try though."
"I always feel bad when giving less than whatever the average stars is, but honestly, I prefer OTTO for quality of food, service and value. It's pretty expensive here and while the Buccatini was good, everything else we ordered (the carbonara included) was either too salty or bland (Carbonara). The antipasti were overpriced and soooo small. Service was great however, as was the Tartufo dessert, which I highly recommend. But there are just too many better italian restaurants (Otto among them) for me to highly recommend this one."
"Pommes Frites.....another East Village gem, small establishment with long lines cooks crispy and generous fries with their signature sauces and dips. Best for late nights or something to nibble when walking the park nearby."
"We have been going to Nyonya throughout the past year and also take out regularly. I am yet to find a single problem to complain about. It's consistent, great authentic Malaysian/Peranakan food...no frills, but no need - it's all about the food here. Nasi Lemak, Beef Rendang, Roti Canai, Hainanese Chicken, Squid Curry, Kang Kung Belacan, Crab...etc. on the spot, every time. The food wasn't much better in the Singapore hawker centers, and it's not fair to compare...for the US it cannot get much better."
"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I've ordered delivery and sat down to order, both were still delicious. Definitely get the steak frites. When those squishy fries fall into the flavorful juices seeping from your medium rare steak and soak up the seasoning and meaty goodness into their potato-y bodies like a sponge, you'll be glad your ordered that dish. They are super good at brunch as well. $15 for an entree, tea/coffee and a cocktail!"
"I love their sliders, but I need their cook to learn how to make a well done slider.. I come here a lot, I freaking love their bacon, cheese and grilled onion sliders, but I always have to send them back because they are still pink inside. I know that some people enjoy their burgers like this, which is fine, but I get very annoyed when I ask for a well done burger, specifically, and still get a pink burger... I love you Mark, but please get my order right. Aside from that, the place is a cute little spot in the East Village, with good music, a nice crowd and atmosphere."
"I just finished reading a great book (Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan) and two of the main characters are professors at NYU! In the book, they were set up by a mutual friend and had their first date at La Lanterna di Vittorio, an Italian restaurant with an enclosed garden right near campus. I am a huge fan of reading (especially guilty pleasure books such as this one) and even a bigger fan of exploring new restaurants - I knew I had to check this spot out! We each ordered a glass of red wine: the Carmenere Cab. It was delicious and under $10. We decided to split two items: pizza and lasagna. Since Aish is a vegetarian, we stuck to items both of us could enjoy and ethically enjoy :) For our pizza, we ordered the Pizza con Cipolla e Caprino (topped with goat cheese, caramelized onions, walnuts and extra virgin olive oil). Do not be deceived - those slices that LOOK like sausage are caramelized onion! The pizza was super delicious EVEN without meat! It was thin-crust and made to order. I'm glad we split it so we could try two different items. The other entrÃ©e we split was the Lasagna Quattro Formaggi with Black Truffle Paste! NOM! It was like a cheese explosion accented with truffle yumminess The lasagna was delicious! I took a bite and burned my mouth off - so be cautioned food is served HOT here. Also, I didn't realize this had no tomato in it so when compared to the pizza dish, there wasn't much contrast (cheese vs. more cheese). Next time, I would order the pesto one or meat sauce (damn vegetarians! hehe). The garden were we sat is beautiful - the rest of the dining space seems a bit dark/cramped, so the outside area is wonderful. I highly recommend this spot: the prices are right (most pizzas are $12-$14 depending on toppings) and the ambiance is awesome."
"A hipster chicken place that also makes amazing desserts. It's pretty popular and on the small side so be prepared to wait if you are going at a busy time. First time I went, I got the fried chicken with mac and cheese and a biscuit. Mmm. So good. My father-in-law, a former chef that is usually very picky, loved the place so much that he didn't make fun of the hipster waiters. He got the pulled pork sandwich and enjoyed it a lot. My wife got the chicken and waffles and was thrilled. I've also had the catfish a few times and really liked that as well. The dinners were great, but the desserts were even better. I got a candy bar pie. Amazing. Apple pie with cheddar cheese made me apprehensive, but it turned out to be delicious too. I've been here twice and grabbed a couple of donuts to go on my way out both times, a move that I felt was pretty smart."
"Fare warning to those who get claustrophobic...this place gets packed. EATLY is right near the Empire State Building. The store is divided into sections. There is a cheese stand, wine, coffee, gelato, pasta, rotisserie, Â etc... While all the food looked amazing, I'm not sure I would actually go to do legitimate shopping due to the crowd. There was a considerable line for the bathroom, which was clean, around 3 pm on a Friday."
"One of the best ramen places so if you live in near by or not. Â GO! Â There is always a wait, except from 4-5 pm, when the majority of people are still working/ too early for dinner. Â Spacious and great for tourists if you don't mind the wait. Â It is worth it though, just past the time w/ a few drinks at their bar or another bar near by! Â Get the pork buns (there's a photo), the wine, the sake, the regular ramen w/ pork. Â  Everything is good here!"
"It's been a couple of weeks since we spent the night together and, can I just say, that I really can't stop thinking about you. No one knows or loves you quite like I do. You're there to support me through group gatherings, both large and small. You're there to help when I don't know what to order. You're there for me at the beginning or end of a long night out. I know that I can always count on you to deliver a heavenly chicken-liver baguette. I can count on you to fill the empty void in David's stomach (which he so often gets). And I can count on you to satisfy my late night pickle craving. What we've got is real babe. I can't wait till we meet again."
I've been back 3 times since writing my original review and every time it has been wonderful. Becoming my favorite nice restaurant in New York- I love the lunch soups! And the service is by far some of the best I've ever received. Will always make time for a visit here when I'm in the city.
"Ramps!!! Pizza with ramps, I mean it doesn't he more amazing than that for me. That was the special pizza but the regular menu supreme meat pizza was delicious and had such a nice mixture or tastes without being overly meaty (I'm not a huge meat eater normally). Also the special appetizer of zucchini florets stuffed with seafood was superb. Tons of flavor with a delicious tomato ragu Â style sauce that brought out the seafood taste. I will definitely be back to try some of their pasta dishes...or maybe just more pizza!!! Last but not least was the great service. Our waitress was very friendly and gave the best recommendations which really stood out, namely the meat pizza."
"Great banh mi, vietnamese iced coffee, and some spicy noodle beef soup (I think it was called something sate - I branched out from my usual pho). Â I would like to come back and try some pho or the cellophane noodles with pork. Â And some more of that addictive coffee :)"
Great noodle soups. I love the dry noodle soups and speciality tea drinks. Great customer service. Be prepared to wait for seating. The restaurant tends to get very busy on weekends and evenings.
"This is a really good dumpling house. Small and nondescript but what a menu of items. And so many things to order. And u can even bring home ur own dumplings to make. It's really such a bargain for a more than satisfying meal so no complaints folks. Â We got the 5/$1 dumplings and also tried the scallion pancake sandwiches with pork and duck. Not a ton of meat but very flavorful and tasty. And u can't beat the price $1.75. And the pancakes are fresh and flaky. Â Very tasty and flavorful. Anyone who does complain better start appreciating the value of the dollar and what it gets u at this great little find. And please folks this is a guy who runs his own business with his fam and works super hard to deliver quality eats at bargain prices. Â If u r looking for ambiance, don't come here. But if u r looking for good eats, pipe down and hand over some cash. Warning very small seating so take out is a way better idea."
"Great cheap dinner spot! I ordered the broiled salmon and greens. I probably could have made this at home, but salmon for under 10 bucks?! Too legit to quit! I would recommend it!"
"So many reviews, so I'll keep it short. I had the Portobello and Goat Cheese Sandwich. AMAZING! Then I tried the corn, which I kept reading about. It was good, but a little spicy. I normally like spicy, but this was all over my lips as I tried to eat the corn and burned them. Worth it though!"
"Having lived in NYC all my life there are so many options when it comes to ordering Cantonese style Chinese food! It's a problem I'm sure out-of-towners or people who love Chinese food would love to have, but in a WEIRD way it limits my options because it's overwhelming and I end up sticking to a handful. I know, completely backwards thinking, but if you get me.....you get me! :) Hence why I've only been to Big Wong twice, but each time was a home run! I've sit-in once and I've done take-out once. Both times I was here I had the Roast Pork over Rice. The Roast Pork is glazed perfectly and they are extremely generous with the portion of Roast Pork. The one time I had take-out, the rice had dried up a bit (which was sort of expected) and it made it a bit more difficult to fork up the rice into my mouth. Nevertheless, the Roast Pork was still sweet, savory and ooooo so good!"
"Best little Mexican Â in the area .... Food delicious, service friendly, quick and efficient ... Cheap!..... It's a little hole in the wall,, eat in on stalls against the wall, or take out!"
Very interesting and good food.
"The building this restaurant is amazing! We were seated right by the floor to ceiling windows and had such a pleasant view of the East River. Service was great. The manager even came by to let us know since we ordered white meat chicken it would take a few minutes longer. Even when my green tea came out and when the server was pouring it out and some came outta the lid with small leaf pieces, the server apologized and came back with another pot. That's a first but very appreciated. We ordered the pork belly and fried egg sandwich with corn meal battered tomato. All the flavors married well. Hubby thought pork belly was a bit fatty but I didn't mind. He ordered the chicken and waffles. Solid dish as well. The chicken was battered with rosemary and so juicy. The waffles were like liege but savory with a side of really good maple syrup. Sad we didn't have room for dessert, but a place definitely coming back to!!!"
"I love, love, love this place. Been here plenty of times. Friendly staff, GREAT food. Some of the highlights on the menu: the chicken (of course), their Mac n cheese (both the regular and the jalapeÃ±o version), their sweet potato fries, creamed spinach and lemon and parsley sauce. Yum!"
"I really enjoyed this place. It's a great bar if you're just looking for a place to talk and gave a quiet, but good time. This place is VERY intimate, so if your looking for a loud rowdy bar this isn't it. But drinks are well proceed, they have a good beer selection, and the bench is made out of velvet, or something similar. Also, if you're trying to take pictures with your phone; it's too dark for most smartphone cameras. But then maybe that's intentional..."
"Don't believe the hype. Cute place in the middle of nowhere. The two up tables were a little too close together for my taste. The servers are very nice but asked us to move during our meal to accomodate a table for four. I had the guacamole. It was good for $5, the chips were better than most and reasonable. I had such an unmemorable meal here, I mostly forgot what I ordered. 2 tacos, maybe? My date had the goat taco. I took a bite out of it and choked. It tasted like musty dorm socks and sweaty teenage balls. I wasn't raised with gamey meat, but this really takes the cake on strong flavor. Plus, the meat was really dry. I am a little disappointed in this place. I was hoping it would be better, less mediocre. I recommend going to Roosevelt Ave. in Queens or Tacos Matamoros instead, they have incredible tacos for $1.25."
"Absolutely love this place. Tiny little nook with one long bar and a few tiny tables squished against the wall. Just one girl running the place and she's great. Great food, wine, and ambience."
"This place is great! The ambience is just perfect, cute and cozy but sexy and upscale all at the same time. I loved the music and they employees really seemed to exude an air of joy, like they were all just happy to be there. My date and I got food as well, so were we're seated in the more spacious back area. We had the oysters, the bacon wrapped lamb chops (score!) and the asparagus salad (very good as well). I recall getting the Ginger Smash and the Si Mamacita. My date got two different drinks. We were both extremely impressed with our cocktails. I will return soon!"
"My chirashi had too many attempts at creativity going on to really appreciate the star of the dish, my fish. Â All the too-sweet sauce got in the way of enjoying the actual flavor that is the point of a chirashi bowl. Also my shrimp was clearly frozen before and only partially thawed."
"A monthly regular at Corner Bistro. This place is a no frills bar serving some damn good burgers. On a paper plate, your choices are limited with a hamburger, cheeseburger (add cheese) or bistroburger (add bacon + cheese) or a chicken sandwich. All are really good and well done. Also they have McSorleys on tap, so it's a winner either way given the price vs quality. Would highly recommend, even though Regis doesn't (HIMYM)."
"NY Times categorized Good Fork as Asian, Korean. This is not Korean. You've got Korean, Vietnamese, Italian, American...it's kind of all over the place, and I just didn't like it all that much. If you want Korean, go to Seoul Garden. If you want Vietnamese go to ThaiSon. For Italian go to Fragole, and American go to Shake Shack. I get it, they are trying to be a fusion of cuisines, but nothing melded together. It felt as if we ordered from 5 take out places and we were eating it all together bc we were indecisive. But if I had to judge the plates individually and not as a cohesive meal, it was alright. The dumplings are definitely worth the trek-- but 1. too bad its only an appetizer and 2. its only about 4 for $8. The diver sea scallops were good, but they were 3 small ones. The Vietnamese spare ribs, came off the bone nicely, but the sauce was not marinated into the ribs, so the meat had no flavor, bc the sauce was only glazed on. The halibut was actually not bad, but Mermaid Inn is way better. Nothing stood out. It was definitely edible and we were full. But is it worth the trek to Red Hook? Maybe no."
"loved the food and drinks, but the people scene is ridiculous. ill just keep my eyes on my food and drinks filled. came on a friday at 630, to skip the late night wait. was seated in 15 minutes upstairs. waiter service was great. for drinks i had the salty dog (grapefruit cocktail) and a 2nd with orange juice (forgot the name but that was killer! so good!). food wise, wow-- started with deviled eggs (it was just okay, but only 3$ so oh well), chicken liver (honestly so smooth and not gag me liver taste. best ive had in NY), and special of the day, pork cheeks bruschetta (i love babbo's beef cheeks, and spotted pigs pork cheeks are almost as nice). entree, we had shared the burger and quail. burger was cooked perfectly-- and doesnt come with lettuce/onions/toppings-- nor does it need to. the meat itself is good with shoestring rosemary fries of course! and the quail...this is my first time having quail...it doesnt taste like chicken...maybe the texture is like a frog...but nonetheless fun and just enough as a tasting plate since we shared the burger. and to top it off-- yes we are glutinous-- we shared a lemon lime tart. Â great way to end the night...yum....."
"Was not all that at brunch. Â Pancakes and salmon platter were mediocre, bacon was very good though."
Great restaurant with a great vibe... and one thing worth noting: why the hell is this place sooooooo packed even at 6pm on a weekday?!
"2nd trip here and had the pigs head. Who knew a pigs head could be so delicious. And the best part, the freakin ear. Â The ear! Â Delicious! 1st trip I am visiting for work from San Diego and told I HAVE TO eat here...so I did. Sat at the bar and had good service. Started with a beer, make sure to ask for a sample if you never had it before to make sure you'll like it. Had the lamb tartar first, it was good but actually pretty light flavored with most of the richness from the yolk. Than I had the bone marrow which was excellent. The combination of richness from the marrow and freshness of herbs and citrus was an awesome flavor combination. Want to go back with a friend so I can order the pigs head.... As a side note, they play Netflix movies at the bar, at one point I had to do a double take as a major booby scene was on the screen, I thought is was porn at first but just turned out it was a B movie."
OMG the ricotta is all I have to say. Pasta dishes were good too. I think the pumpkin sage ravioli is a little sweet but people who are into that will love it. The pasta with duck sausage and escarole was delicious though!
"Calling this and the chemicals i used to eat in college both ramen is a sin. The food is delicious and perfect for the weather we've been dealing with - warms the stomach and the soul. We tried pork buns and then ramen. The buns were phenomenal and I'd return just for them a second time. I got something with a hardboiled egg in it, which I was hesitant of, but it turned out to be absolutely lovely!"
"Best ramen in America. It's really really delicious. The broth is so flavorful that you don't ever doubt someone put a whole lot of love and care into cooking just the broth. The noodles are thin and hard, cooked perfectly. Their pork buns have a sweet and spicy pork belly which was delicious, but at $9/2 buns is kinda pricey. The ambiance is so cool. The energy is exciting and it's New York, that alone makes the ramen taste better haha. Tip: stopped by on a Monday night at 10: 20pm when they close at 11pm, still had to wait 20minutes, which I heard is a very short wait considering it's Ippudo."
"Came here late on a Saturday night. Great drinks. Started off with an Amelia for me, Roselle for my friend. Both were great, but a little on the sweeter side. Asked the super cute bartender for something that was a bit more herbal-y, and he immediately started making a drink - wish I could remember the name but it had gin, thyme, ginger, mint, cucumber, lime, and probably a couple of other ingredients I can't remember. Divine. Love. I can't believe this is my first time here - it's only a few blocks from me and will surely become a local spot. So awesome and really excited to come back. FYI - if you're looking to meet someone, my friend and I were hit on by no less than six guys within an hour. Definitely more scene-y during weekends. I'll probably reserve it for weekdays when it's not so crowded."
Best place to get good Vietnamese sandwich in Chinatown!!! It tasted best if you eat it immediately at the place. This place give you more meats than other places in chinatown and that's what make it better!
"Came here with a group for brunch following the NYC Half Marathon. We had a reservation. The popcorn they serve at the table is amazing. You will keep asking for more of it. People talk up their duck and waffles, but their bird burger is one of the most unique burgers I have eaten. I am still thinking about it. Their coffee cake is also huge. You will need to share it or take some home with you. They also have a meadmosa drink, which combines two of my favorite things. They also have plenty of other beers, cocktails, and wines to choose from. Service is friendly and attentive. I plan to come back."
"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW: You can't beat this happy hour, you just CAN'T. Â $6 mojito's, two will get you BUZZED, three will do you in... seriously. Â Half price tapas on Tuesday, all the items I had were pretty good (short ribs, crab cakes, calamari). Â Outdoor seating when the weather is nice, big open windows if you can't get one outdoors. Â Best of all, HH starts at ONE O F*CKIN CLOCK... and goes until 8:00pm. Â If I get out of work early, you know where I'm goin."
"Recently came here when meeting someone in Red Hook. Just took a chance because this street seems to get nicer and nicer with new restaurants, coffee shops, etc. I ended up really liking this place. We ordered a Latte and Key Lime Pie. Both were great. The Key Lime pie is Steve's Key Lime Pie which you can get nearby at that shop...which I have done before. Look forward to going back here in the future."
"I normally shy away from Williamsburg for Sunday brunch, but based on a tip ""no hipsters each brunch before noon"" we arrived at Rye at 11 am for brunchies. Bottom line: YUM. We started with their homemade ""donuts"" (more like donut holes). Crispy on the outside, tender and spicy on the inside, I wish we'd saved these for dessert. They were served with a side of whip cream, which I thought didn't add anything, but... *shrug*. We also had a duck rillette. Kind of a duck pate, and some ""sourdough."" I say ""sourdough"" because sorry, as much as we might try, proper sourdough cannot be made outside of San Francisco. But the rillette was quite tasty as well. For my entree, I tried the Meatloaf Sandwich I'd heard so many raves about. And it was worth it. A combination of duck, veal, and beef, it was rich and delicious. I am STILL FULL 8 hours later it was so good. One thing: too much bread. The meatloaf PLUS the giant roll is too much. It would be excellent as an open-face sandwich or heck, ALONE on a plate, with some fried onions on top. It is seriously solid enough to stand alone. While some have complained about the service, ours was great. The waitress was attentive, and our water and coffee were constantly being topped off. The decor is very turn of the century (whether it's real or just made to look that way I'm not sure...) with tin ceilings, old wood floors, old silver used everywhere (mismatched cutlery, old coffee urns, and the check plate). All in all we were very pleased with our brunch. We lingered till around 12:30 pm, when all the hipsters started trickling in."
"This place is amazing, what can I say, though the wait can be tough. If they have the buffalo chicken meatball with blue cheese sauce, get it! Also, the cookie ice cream sandwiches are amazing."
"This is definitely a hidden gym in woodside! I found this place through yelp and decided to give it a try based on the good reviews it had.Well, let me tell you...I am so glad I decided to try it, the crepe was delish! I had the strawberry,banana,almonds and light Nutella crepe...YUM! Will definitely be back."
"Very nice and welcoming staff/atmosphere. A different style of Australian food than I was used to having; was clean and fresh. Since there are smaller dishes, I was able to try a range of flavors from the menu (the scallops and the lamb dishes really stood out). And to go along with everything, a great by the glass wine list to pair with each different dish. Service was excellent. Located around the corner from the 1st avenue L stop, conveniently on my way home, I look forward to going back very soon. Seems nothing negative to say here, if I have a similar experience when I return, I will change my rating to 5 stars. Went back, very consistent, 5 stars now."
"Excellent brunch. Â The charm of this little space matches the neighborhood. Â Reservation was essential, but despite the crowd waiting outside, we never felt rushed. Â  Looking forward to visiting again for dinner- brunch offerings don't always showcase what the chef can really do."
"Meh. I had a high expectation of this place after hearing so many good things about it, but the food was only mediocre. The chicken liver toast was good, but a tad too salty for me. The Chargrilled Burger was not bad, but it was not anything to rave about either. I've had better for a cheaper price at Flat Top, Corner Bistro, etc. But I must say I really enjoyed the Shoestring Fries that were served on the side. In sum, I don't think this place is worth waiting for 2-3 hours. There are so many cheaper, superior food options in the neighborhood that doesn't require such a crazy wait. But if you must try, I suggest you come early for dinner on a weekday. I got here with a friend at around 6 on a weekday and there was no wait at all."
"Came across David Burke Fabrick when walking by so went for dinner. For appetizer we got the Avocado Panna Cotta. Â This was like a smooth guacamole with chips and cheese. Â Great start. Then we shared the Skirt Steak with chimichurri, chorizo, potato & cheese fritter, Burger and the best dish Butternut Squash & Wild Mushroom Pappardelle. That pasta dish was amazing and unique. For dessert we had the Burke-n bag chocolate dessert that was beautifully made into a handbag :P and the Banana Spit with the Empire State Cookie on top that I requested. The food and dessert were equally just as good."
"I don't know what's worse, waiting for these fries to cool or burning my mouth eating them right out of the fryer. Get the mango chutney mayo and you can't go wrong. This place has frites done right!"
"Oh Han Dynasty, you showed me how amazing Chinese food can be. Â Far from the usual neighborhood Chinese takeout place, this place is packed with people for good reason. Â The food is delicious. The menu is helpfully organized by spice level with a number from 1-10. Â We opted for 3's and 4's for our first trip and it was a pleasant level of spice and flavor. Â My friend who recommended the place said he's been all the way up to 10 and it Â never gets crazy, just more tingly and yummy. Â We are going for 5's and 6's next time. We started with the dumplings in chili oil which were amazing. Â Not deep fried or watery like a lot places, these were just jam packed with flavor. Â We followed those up with garlic shrimp and double cooked style dishes both of which were yummy and moreish. Service was quick, friendly and efficient. Â I highly recommend the place and can't wait to go back. Tip: Grab a seat at the spacious bar if the place is full."
"Contemporary NYC restaurant that is supposedly famous for its Mac n Cheese. I came in search of the mac holy grail and got a decent, but in my opinion overpriced (even by NYC standards). Â  I had the bacon and gouda, which was tasty and rich, but for $10, I expected a little something more. I also had the sweet potato fries which turned out to be a revelation. They were surprisingly delicious and you got a healthy portion for the $5 price tag. The garlic aioli that came with it was phenomenal! Â  They have a sadly limited beer selection and I was a little shocked that they don't do samples of their draft beers, so you better know your beer, have UnTappd or place your $8 bets and go in blind. My waiter was grossly unknowledgeable about their beer offerings. They had about 4 seasonals on draught (one of which was a Stella...which y'all, is not a ""seasonal""). When I asked what kind of beer the Bronx was the waiter told me ""that is the beer"", obviously not having any clue as to what the style of beer they were serving from Bronx brewery. I looked up the breweries offering on my beer app and found that I could't go wrong with whatever they might have, so I ordered that and asked if the waiter could ask the bartender what style the beer was ""as in IPA, Belgian, Amber etc"". He brings me out the beer and tells me he was told it was the Black IPA. I am somewhat of a beer geek and just by looking at the beer could tell it was not that. My palate sorted out that it was, in fact, the Bourbon Ale IPA, which was even better since that is one of my fav type of beers. On the plus side, for an $8 pint, it was in a nice, cold tall glass, so at least I got my hops worth. Â  I really wanted to like this place, but there was nothing notable or even semi-memorable that would make me come back or even recommend this place. And, though I was sat promptly, their seating also leaves a lot to be desired. Their half booth set up puts the tables too close together to the point that I was literally trapped and had to disturb the couple next to me to scoot my table over enough to barely squeeze my large triceps (I did so unsuccessfully as I almost knocked over my water glass) just to leave. You also get complimentary biscuits, but mine was brought as an afterthought halfway into my meal after the two other tables next to me got theirs when they were sat. I was also severely disappointed that their staff had no clue what beer they were serving me. Â  So 3-stars for the Mac n Cheese, 4-stars for the fries and beer quality, 2-stars for seating and service and since comfort/service can make or break a meal, 2-stars overall it is."
"Ok so let me start off and say I do love their food and would really like to rate them higher but they have the WORST delivery/customer service I have ever seen. Every single time that I have ordered lunch from them they are at least a half hour late. Good luck trying to call the place. It is so loud in there the person on the phone is screaming at you the entire time, they can never understand a word you say, and you will be on hold for at least 10 minutes. I'm writing this now as I am on hold, and have been for 5 minutes so far. It's just absolutely ridiculous that they can't be better than this, or even make an attempt. I may just stop ordering from them all together to save myself the frustration every time."
"First - let me tell you about the ""MUST DO"" stuff I have noticed so far: - Pecan Crunch Doughnut (OH EM GEE) - Rob Evans (Biscuit with eggs and white sausage gravy) SO EFFING DELICIOUS - Fried Chicken and Waffles (Do I need to explain??) - $16 Pitcher of Brooklyn Pilsner I hear that the Mac N Cheese here is really good but I have not had a chance to try yet. This joint is SMALL so be prepared to possibly have a bit of a wait and they do not take reservations. Â  We had a group of 8 and we were sat on a Saturday afternoon in about 30 minutes which I thought was pretty good. Our server was attentive and friendly and all of his recommendations were out of this world good! Â I am looking forward to going back and trying more awesome stuff. BTW - their doughnuts are the size of 2 muffins. Â They are HUGE. Â You can definitely share them with other people, but if you get the pecan doughnut, you may just want to keep it for yourself - it's that good! Enjoy!"
"I went here for lunch this past weekend and had a terrible time. I ordered the same meal i always do and it came out totally different. First of all, they messed it up and said I wanted my soup spicy which was not the case. They finally brought me the right order and it was nothing like I have ever seen! Big disappointment....i will give this place another try, but if they do this to me again, they'll see me walk out that door for good."
"Worth a try if you want to try out what all the talk is about, but aside from the vanity of having done so, I can recommend better pizza elsewhere with less lines and better selection."
Nice and cozy place. I went there with my friends to have lunch. We had fried calamari and green salad for appetizers was very good.I had sauteed duck it was very good too. Service is average for me.
"I had never been a banh mi enthusiast. Do not get me wrong, I used to enjoy an occasional Vietnamese sandwich from time to time. All that changed after I had stumbled to this little hole-in-the-wall on the corner of Bergen and Smith St. Â The way they prepare this bad boy has opened my eyes on how good a sandwich (not just a banh mi) can truly be. Â  The heap of the pickled daikon radish & carrot provide the perfect acidity countering the savory elements of ground pork, pate, and Vietnamese ham. The trio of the meats work beautifully with the mayo in this sandwich. The baguette is fresh and the cilantro adds herbal freshness and crispness. The spiciness(they fine tune the heat level based on your preference) provides a great rush as well. Â I recall having it for the first time ever and being awe-struck from the disbelief of how good it was. Â Did I tear up? Did my eyes roll in the back of my head? I cannot recall exactly, but it was one of those rare experiences that Â us, food lovers, seek out. It made me the true banh mi believer - i was converted from that first bite. I remember once trying their grilled pork sandwich, for the sake of variety. It was pretty good but failed to amaze and did not stand out Â to me like their staple, the classic did. Since then, I have never made another attempt to try any of the other sandwiches on their menu (no need to experiment when you have a great thing going already). Â  I work a 5 minute walking distance away, so I feel truly lucky to be able to frequent this place at least once a week. Â I have been to Nicky's Vietnamese Sandwiches on Atlantic Ave, which is not far away from Hanco's and as far as the banh mi goes, I don't even have to tell you who the clear-cut winner is. Hanco's is a no-brainer. Â Stop by, order a classic (or even 2, should you be really hungry), with a summer roll. Â You will not be disappointed. ~This review is mainly directed to the classic banh mi at this particular spot on Bergen. Â I have not been to the other Hanco's establishments in the city."
"Sweet as our waiter kept saying and we were hooked. For months, I've had this bookmarked, notably for the fame of Chef Simmons but never got around it due to this tiny cozy joint being a busy bumble bee. Service was sweet, sitting under the A/C was even better but sitting so close under other diners was somewhat claustrophic. Suddenly I hear myself whispering to my dude, that's no fun is it and we spent majority of the time eating our food listening to the table next to us gossip about life changes and how them shoes just don't fit her goddamn feet. What? Nonetheless, pickled mussels in a jar was straight up different, worth a try but weird. EEEK. The fried chicken was a blast. Juicy & meaty, the way Â life should be. I wanted more. No oil, perfectly fried, Seems as healthy as can be!!!!!!!!!!!!! Would def come back for the chicken chicken chicken."
Crepe pizza amalgams are really fantastic. Â I would recommend you get cheese on anything not sweet. Â The guy and girl who work there are awesome!
"Came here for brunch. Had a reservation for 11:45 but showed up around 11:20, hoping they Â could fit us in. Most of the restaurant was empty but they wouldn't seat us because all of the two person tables were filled. Soooo, we waited for 25 minutes while they seated a group of 6 ahead of us. I could tell that the manager was embarrassed by the situation and they made up for it at the end of the meal by giving us a complementary sampling of their pastries. The food itself was 3 stars. We had the grilled bread with ricotta as an appetizer , which was really good but more expensive than probably appropriate ($8 for toast with ricotta and peas). I had the poached eggs with kale and pork sausage which was tasty but not amazing. My wife had the french toast which was likewise. The aforementioned complementary pastries (apple cider donuts, scone, and coffee cake) was pretty good, but free is always amazing, right? The service was actually very good, though the girl that initially took our drink orders was a bit curt. Eater.com seems to have a bit of an infatuation with this place and I, unfortunately, don't really see it."
"I always have a great time at Grimaldi's. The pizza is brick coal oven made and it is simply the best way to make pizza. I went to Grimaldi's before they move a stores up, still a great family experience. Go early, like few minutes after open or else you will suffer the extremely long line of death."
One if the best breakfast places I have been to in New York. Everything about this joint is so hip and authentic from the menu to their style of service. We ordered the veggie flat and the hummus/feta sandwich and quesadilla omelette along with sweet potato fries. Everything was just mouth watering. SPF was the best I have had even when comparing to the ones in Belgium and Amsterdam. I love that they have unlimited refilled on coffee. Overall I thought the price is comparable and reasonable with their service taste and quantity. I would definitely come back again. Â 5stars all the way.
I stopped by for a quick dinner and I ordered some noodles and pot stickers (10 pieces) and the bill was $7. Â Holy crap that is cheap. Â My ice cream at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory was almost that much.
Came here with a friend who lives in the area. Really cool bar. Food was not bad for bar food. Owner was super cool and nice bought us around for living in the neighborhood. Nice to see there are still nice people out there that buy you a drink for supporting their business. Really happy with this place. Also Nice selection of beers and great place to catch a game.
Excellent veggie hummus and falafel. Â The falafel trio is great if you want a healthy and insanely filling meal. Â Friendly staff despite living lunch rush.
"Went for brunch. Had a reservation. Once our entire group arrived, we were seated without delay or any hassle. The food was delicious, though a bit overpriced. Atmosphere was pleasant, but not the greatest scene for a brunch (obviously, the bees knees for a romantic dinner). Overall, a positive experience, but not one that eclipses other brunch favorites throughout the city (Rose Water, Jane, etc)."
"Trattoria Trecolori, you satisfied my craving! I've been having a tough time finding an Italian restaurant that can make the perfect Penne Arrabiata, and Trattoria Trecolori seals the deal! Their Penne Arrabiatta was amazing and even comparable to what I've had in Italy. I would recommend making a reservation because this place does get busy. We came here on a Saturday night before a show, and we had to sit at the bar (which was cool). They were full from walk-ins and from reservations. The service was pretty good. The server/bartender was attentive and the food came out in a timely manner. No complaints. Overall, we had a great experience. Trattoria Trecolori, I will definitely be back when I'm in NYC!"
"Three meals here and none have disappointed. I've eaten in the tavern once, for lunch, and in the Dining Room twice. I would say that the food here wavers between 4 and 5 stars, but the service, attention to detail, and decor push it over the edge. The service at Gramercy Tavern is first class and on par with any of USHG's other restaurants. What I would say though is that I have found them to be a bit more pretentious than sister restaurants such as Eleven Madison Park or Union Square Cafe. This is more observatory since it has never detracted from my experience. The food at Gramercy Tavern is right in my wheelhouse as it's the food I like to eat and the food I like to cook. A Chilled Sorrel Soup made lunch taste of springtime and the Veal Meatball with Potato Puree and Red Wine makes for a hearty, homey, midday interlude. At dinner a Â potato puff amuse makes me wonder if they could have been a little more creative, but an expertly cooked pasta with squid, clam, and chorizo reminds me of the Catalan seaside. The perfectly cooked Halibut served with Braised Red Cabbage and Yogurt, an unlikely combination, makes me thankful for Chef Michael Anthony's readiness to go outside the box. On another visit (and several months later) I am sad to be greeted by the same amuse, but instantly uplifted by a delicate crepe filled with crab and carrot. What really hits the spot this cold night is a Venison Loin, roasted to perfection and served in a meaty Bourbon sauce, more reminiscent of a rich Venison stock than Jack Daniel's. The most perfectly executed wedge of potato pancake served alongside makes me forget that the sauce was too salty. On the sweet side Pecan Pie served with Bourbon Ice Cream is delicious and fun and a Tapioca pudding makes my mothers, an all time favorite, seem even more pedestrian. Go to Gramercy Tavern and expect to have a great experience. You certainly will."
"I have to amend the below review because S&P is now on my faves list - they totally made it up to me. I went back for a second time just because I thought it couldn't be so - such a beautiful space with delicious drinks and food but the service was the only flaw - can we work on this please? I'm so glad I gave Mr. Saxon and Mr. Parole a second chance - the server Christian was amazing and attentive, the pork chop was delicious as always and this is hands down the best Hendricks martini in the city. Sold. Lifelong customer. I'm won over. Please don't close like Double Crown did - thanks :)"
"I'm shocked people had bad things to say about this place until I further investigated and saw all of the negative reviews were from men, OK now it all makes sense - The waiters and staff are all ""off the boat"" Italian men with thick luscious hair, lean bodies, and accents that will make any girl blush. The service is on the laid back side because it truly is run by Italians in a manner we aren't accustomed to, laid back. If you are in a rush to eat, don't dine here. If you want to have a relaxing love affair with food while sitting outdoors in a casual, intimate, romantic setting, this is your choice for dinner. CASH ONLY (another real Italian feature). Each table indoor and outdoor has a candle with paper wrapped around to give the area a nice glow, how clever! Bread is brought to the table, no butter, but there is amazing olive oil on the table (maybe even extra virgin). Feel free to pour the oil in a small plate, mix some pepper and grated cheese and dip the bread away. Asking for more bread isn't frowned upon, so fill up. You will also get a carafe of water so you don't have to look for the waiter every few minutes. Take a look at the specials being offered, try to get something on that list - it's a rule of thumb in these type of establishments. Who am I to break rules? I went with the Lasagna Bolognese and I would say it was easily in my top 10 favorite lasagnas in NYC. I also got the chance to taste another special, the Linguine with seafood. It arrives wrapped like a candy in tissue paper, do not try to remove the food to put it in a plate, it's a rustic place so do not be alarmed! The seafood was plentiful and fresh. The linguine was also cooked just right; al dente! For appetizers i suggest ordering a pizza (if you really don't mind a CARB overload) or Italian sausage with baked polenta cakes. Everything is reasonably priced, the area in serene, and the service is exactly how I like it :)"
"Best dinner choice in Brooklyn? This might be it. Between the steak and being adventurous with whiskey options, I had one of the best meals I've ever had. It was so good, after I was done I thought to myself, 'THIS IS GOING OUT TO DINNER!'. People always 'go out to dinner.' This was 'GO OUT TO DINNER!' If I could add blinking letters with fireworks, I would. The steak sauce was awesome. I ordered my steak medium well(I know, I just lost all credibility), and these guys cooked it exactly as it should be; darker pink in the middle, but not oozing. Lots of places just cook it well, or can't figure out the medium between medium & well done. These guys did. It was awesome. Make a reservation; it makes life a lot easier when you wanna eat here."
Amazing brunch spot - a variety of mimosa types. Try them all!! You literally can't go wrong with any dish.
"my friend proclaimed these the best dumplings he'd ever had. Â i dont know if i could go that far, but for two bucks, they serve up eight delicious pork dumplings and they certainly don't disappoint. Â  they make all their noodles fresh, so watching/hearing the slapping of the noodles on the kitchen counters adds to the experience. Â The beef noodle soup was also tasty, with a good broth and obviously fresh noodles. Â  Cash only, tiny space, but boy do they satisfy on a cold fall night."
"The interior of Church Publick is designed very nicely, and I began making this part of the happy hour rotation for those times my friends or I don't want to just go to just another plain bar in the area. They have a good beer selection here on draft, up to 22 at any given time (not infrequently they won't have anymore of what you ordered). Â There's also a full bar with a very standard selection of spirits, and a moderate wine list. Â It's a nice place to have a few drinks, but is definitely not your most budget-friendly option in the neighborhood. Â  The one time I actually ordered dinner here, I was very impressed. Â With a friend, I shared the Goat Cheese Gnocchi, and a Market Fish Special they had that night. Â Sorry, I forget what kind of fish it was...I just remember it sounding good when the waiter mentioned it. Â  Gnocchi is rarely made great in my opinion, and to my absolute surprise, they were awesome here. Â There was almost an ethereal feeling to them; light, fluffy, and just melted in your mouth. Â Goat cheese wasn't overpowering, and the parsley pesto was a nice complement. The fish that I can't name was cooked perfectly, and tasted very fresh. Â After having these two dishes, my opinion of the chef is that he/she knows exactly how to texture food so that it FEELS good as you bite into it and taste it in your mouth. Â While the fish itself was prepared just right, the flavoring on it was rather bland, and didn't do much for me. Â  I've also ordered the chips with beer and cheese fondue here a few times. Â Its pretty good, very heavy, and comes in a sizeable bowl. Â They're hard to resist when they're sitting in front of you on the table, so unless you have at least 4-5 people, you might end up feeling too full for anythign else after."
"Definitely one of the best BBQ places around. Everything is good. I have been several times and often get the wings. They just do them right. They are grilled with a little bit f a smoky flavor. The Mac and Cheese, the mashed potatoes and gravy, the collard greens are all great sides. Â Everything else I have had is very good two, ribs, brisket, pulled pork. I could recommend any of them."
"My go to pad thai wasn't the best I've tasted, but everything else was pretty good. Stand outs were the papaya salad, the duck, and the fried rice with crab which was surprisingly very tasty. It was really busy and the service wasn't that great but the atmosphere was nice enough so you didn't feel cramped and you didn't feel rushed. It did take a while to get the food. But there were 6 of us so maybe it takes longer when there are more than 4 people ordering. Otherwise, that's really all I could say. Worth to try at least once =)"
"Wow! A few friends brought me here late one Friday night before going out. Â Let me just say, this is one of my favorite places to grab a burger before heading in the west village area. Â The restaurant and bar area are very small but the beer and food are cheap and delicious. Â I'm talking about $3 bud drafts and I believe $8 for the bistro burger complete with bacon and cheese. Â We waited about 35 minutes after putting our name on the list but the cheap beers made the wait go by fast. Â  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would be glad to take an out of town friend here for a NYC experience. Â  Tip - They take cash only! Â There is a Chase ATM a few blocks away."
"My first experience with Robataya was at their sister restaurant in Roppongi (Tokyo). That cost a pretty penny... to the tune of $600+. Thank goodness this place is just as good, within NYC, and is much, much, MUCH more affordable :) Authentic, tasty, relaxing, fun... Sit at the bar counter so you can browse the food options for the day and then watch the chefs grill your food and then hand it to you via long wooden paddles - love it!"
"Came here with a few co-workers to grab some wine, prices arent that bad for the area. Also there dark atmosphere setting makes it a great place if you need a place for a date night. The service was good too."
"Probably one of the best vegan places in NYC. The Chik'n and Biscuit will change your life it's so delicious. The only downside to Champs is that the restaurant is super small and thus cannot accommodate that many customers; therefore, expect to wait, especially on the weekends. Other than that, everything is amazing - must try for all!"
"Yummy! Small little place with these cool but kinda clumsy swinging chairs. I got the brothers Grimm and fries. The brothers Grimm if a chicken wrapped in chestnut and chili dough with pickled shiitake shrooms, raisins plantain chips, pickles and chipotle aioli. Nomnomnom. It sounds like a quirky combo but the flavors mesh beautifully and the ingredients seem fresh."
"I came here with a big group and a reservation in hand. It was empty when we arrived, but it filled up nicely within 40 mins. I ordered the Pescatore with garlic olive oil sauce. I didn't think that the dish was special. The pasta itself was mediocre. And the seafood (clams and mussels) were quite fishy. It didn't feel refreshing after eating the seafood and I felt I had to wash it down with water or wine to get that after-fishy taste out of my mouth. I've had better seafood pasta dishes elsewhere."
"Oh, Cuba, you're really something special. Came here for an early Mother's Day celebration. Made reservations via Open-table, came in, got a table right away, no snobbish attitude here. From the outside, the restaurant looked super tiny and it was incredibly LOUD. Thankfully, they have a lower level! It was much more quiet, low key, and perfect for larger groups, Even better for couples. Service was quick, but very attentive. Sergio made sure that all of our needs were met. Now as for the food, soooooooooooo damn good! Order the mixed seafood cerviche- so good, tangy, a little spicy, just right! Order the empanadas, get all three, it's worth it. The dipping sauce is heavenly. Order the braised oxtails, really really good! It won't disappoint- came with rice and beans. Order the mixed seafood casserole, very good, light sauce but tasty. Order their mojitos, perfect for all! Don't sleep on this place!"
"I loveeee Vitae! I went there the other night with my mom. We didn't know what to expect, we thought it might be another snooty NYC place but it got great reviews so we wanted to try it anyway. It was NOT snooty at all. The place itself has such a great atmosphere, the tables aren't crammed together and it's not too crazy loud. The service was also amazing, everyone was so nice. Now, on to the food. The food titles seem like they could be ordinary... until you read the descriptions. Everything on the menu had an amazing twist. My mom and I shared about 4 appetizers and oh my god they were good. The burrata was incredible, they also had a special of fried oysters that night with aioli and fennel and MAN that was good. We also got a small tasting of the pork tacos which were to die for. Go here!! It's amazing!! Prices are also not bad for the quality of food."
"It was only okay. I thought that the food was very mediocre, and I eat at many restaurants geared toward the same concept (fresh/local/vegetarian) in this city. However, I did make my visit when they had first opened, so I'm not sure if it was because the kitchen was still working out kinks then. I had very unsatisfactory service, so I deducted what would have been a three star review. My server was this girl with glasses and she was a little strange. I asked her if it was possible to put my Liquiteria juice cleanse (which I had just picked up before heading to Ellary's Greens) in their refrigerator. She said it was fine and then was like, ""thank you so much!"" Then she gushed over it to another server, and I realized that she thought I was giving her the juices. Um, what. I don't even know you, and your establishment sells its own juices, so why would I bring you juice? I had to explain that I was asking her to put it in the fridge while I was dining in since they are unpasteurized and raw. I don't know if it was out of embarrassment, but after that she didn't come by my table once other than to bring me the food. I had to ask another server for more water and my check. I left dissatisfied."
"Lunch was great, I tried every single category of meat they offered and everything tasted pretty good. The strip steak was tender, but a little chewy, the scallop was a little fishy, the short rib was pretty good... tasted a little too much like the skirt steak though. The food was good though! I just didn't leave there thinking WOW... as the 4.5 star rating would indicate. This restaurant represents traditional Japanese yakitori... with something as versatile as meat on a stick I guess I was looking for more exotic and creative flavors. The prices are fine... wouldn't call it pricey. Bottom Line: You will enjoy your meal, but the meats aren't mind boggling delicious... but they are good. Â The quiet ambiance, diverse meat selection, and cultured staff, makes this restaurant a 4 store joint."
"I LOVE that this location has a lot of seating compared to the location at Waverly Pl. The food, I found, is the same and service is very quick. Crunchy falafels, delicious hummus, and fluffy pita with za'atar dusted on top. My favorite is the spicy red falafel. I haven't been back in while but I saw that the platters are a bit smaller now when I glanced at my neighbor's plate. Either way, the food is fabulous and I like how it doesn't feel like quick food. Very trendy, on-the-go, spot and it fills you up without the huge guilt trip of eating something heavy."
"I hadn't had much success with the prior restaurants under Gabe Stuhlman, but when Joseph Leonard came highly recommended to me for brunch, I eventually gave in. Before noon on a Saturday morning, we wound our way through West Village and arrived at the entrance on Wavery Place. Despite the fact that it was still fairly early for a weekend brunch, we gave them a name and phone number and were given a 15 minute wait time. After we returned, the hostess showed us to our seats, which turned out to be two stools against the counter near the kitchen. It allowed us a clear view into the kitchen and its workings, and I certainly appreciated the chance to see several finished plates go out, comparing them to what was listed on the brunch menu. For the most part, the menu at Joseph Leonard is fairly standard, with a few interesting twists. An earlier skim of the menu had helped me make a decision beforehand: the saucisson a l'ail. Our orders were quickly taken and our dishes were soon placed in front of us. The feature of saucisson a l'ail is the garlic sausauge, a traditional French concoction that includes a healthy dose of garlic into the typical sausage components. I was given four generous cuts and while I do enjoy my protein, I wasn't entirely blown away by the taste or the texture. The flavors were rather flat, and the ratio of fatty to lean meat seemed to be pretty skewed as well. Two fried eggs were served on the side and as I am horribly biased towards poached eggs, found these to be fairly standard as well. The best part of this dish, however, was the the hashbrown. It's the first of its kind that I've seen: a thick cut of perfectly pan fried julienned potatoes was topped off with a handful of arugula and crÃ¨me fraÃ®che. A good balance of ingredients, it was one of the most satisfying preparations of potato that I've yet to have. Unfortunately, the potatoes weren't enough to save the meal. The brussel sprouts with sriracha were disappointing; the brussel sprouts weren't properly charred and the sriracha was only lightly drizzled over the top. The bite of the fried chicken sandwich that I did have wasn't particularly memorable, either. While Joseph Leonard does have some redeeming points, I don't see enough to encourage a return visit."
"Amazing burger that's quite unique. Crisp toasted white bread, a cheese bechamel topping a perfectly cooked burger all that and a nice cartelized onions spread. Great fries to boot. The Arctic Char Salad was a great pick too. Fresh, vibrant flavored and very healthy. Charming interior design."
Average dumplings for super cheap! Hardly any place to sit but can't complain!
"Bouley is definitely on the same level as some of my favorites Eleven Madison Park, Gotham Bar and Grill, and Daniel. I settled on the tasting menu and they allowed me to make a few changes. I changed my first course and dessert and they did not blink an eye! It was designed to be 6 courses but after all the freebies and extras it turned out to be an 11 or so course feast. The service was impeccable and attention to detail amazing. They came around with 2 different bread baskets. The first included a delicious apple-walnut bread and baguette (which I don't like) from Bouley Bakery while I looked at the menu. Then after my amuse they came around with three more - pistachio, raisin, and sourdough. Here is what I ate and yes every single course was absolutely spectacular. The tasting menu portions were very very generous and I left feeling very satisfied, if not even a little over full. They started me off with a pumpkin soup that had a ricotta crema and chestnut. This was fall in a bowl. I usually don't get hyped up about amuses but this was great. Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi- There had to be about a half pound of crab in this ""little"" pot. I do not know what the regular size is but if this was any indication it must have a pound of crabmeat in it. The broth was sinfully awesome. Chatham Day Boat Lobster Brown and White Honshimeji Mushrooms, Fresh Passion Fruit & Mango, Fresh Lychee, Hyssop- Wonderful lobster and the sauces were a great compliment. Again a very nice portion size which I was grateful for. Definitely not stingy with lobster meat- nice tail and big claw. Live Sea Scallops & Nantucket Bay Scallops Prepared in a Tandori Manner, with Spices Imported from a Friend's Spice Shop in Paris, Local Curried Cauliflower Puree- This was the lightest course with 3 little scallops and one large one. The spice was a very nice tough. Although this was my least favorite, the dish was executed nicely. Organic Long Island Duckling Roasted with Truffle Honey, Puree of Nevada Organic dates with Turnips, Julienne of Local Beets- This was a knockout of a dish. Perfectly cooked rare duck and nice crispy crunchy skin on it. The truffle honey sauce was incredible as I love the balance between the saltiness of duck and sweetness of sauce. Coconut soup with Pineapple granite and Yogurt sorbet- This was a pre-dessert but omg it may have been the best thing I ate all night! You would think this would be an after thought but I could have had five more. It was like the best pina colada I have ever had. The coconut soup, pineapple, and the sorbet were perfection personified. Amaretto Flan Caramelized Banana, White Coffee Mousse Amaretto and Vermont Maple Ice Creams- I subbed this because I didn't want to try the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake and I was not disappointed. I LOVE Amaretto and this was so delicious. The ""flan"" was like a 4 inch rectangule of amaretto custard and the tablespoon of bananas paired with the delicious quenelles of ice cream were perfect. As if that were not enough they gave me a complimentary dessert also which I could not finish. At this point I was bursting. Oh yeah and the petit fours tower too. So many treats and so delicious. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great without being intrusive. Overall, when putting it all together Bouley delivers the whole package- Food, Ambience, Service. I loved it and will definitely be back again.. and again.. and...yes again."
"After reading some of the other reviews, I'm wondering if maybe I went on a bad night, I'm missing something, or maybe my taste buds have been burned off in some freak accident I am unaware of. I just wasn't that impressed... And I am middle-eastern, so clearly, anything I say here takes much higher precedence than any person of different descent. Hmph! Anyways, I had falafel and tamarind juice.... + falafel not too huge + falafel not too greasy + tamarind juice! woooooo so excited to see this!!!! - oh crap, but it doesn't actually taste very much like tamarind. they should just call it mystery juice - I would have been pleasantly surprised. ha. - falafel not very flavorful - falafel is green! wtf!?!?! IS THERE SPINACH IN MY FALAFEL?!?!?! quel blaspheme!!!! - tahini is chalky I can see that after a night of imbibing, that this place could become a favorite (what with extremely low prices and fast food). Next time I find myself verging on inebriated, in the neighborhood, and hungry, I would come here. Until then, likely not."
"I went to Ippudo today with with a couple of my friends and boyfriend. The restaurant is pretty crowded on a Saturday afternoon, so we had to wait three minutes for a seat. Not a big deal. When we were being lead into the seating area, a lot of the waiters greeted us loudly and welcoming. It definitely came to my surprise. The restaurant has a very nice lounge theme; has lounge chairs and club music (good thing the music isn't loud, that's a plus!). At the same time, the restaurant doesn't lose its Japanese ambiance. Not knowing what to order, my friend suggested me the Akamaru Ramen. I ordered it and for a busy Saturday afternoon I was very surprised how quickly our food arrived! The Akamaru Ramen is delicious and salty (but doesn't taste too salty). It's very flavorful. Like usual, the broth of the Ramen tastes a bit too strong (all Ramen tastes a bit too strong from my experiences), so I had to take a couple of sips of water every few minutes to get some of the flavor out of my mouth. My boyfriend had the Shiromaru Ramen. Again, the ramen is very flavorful and delicious. It's definitely less salty than the Akamaru Ramen, so if you would like ramen that tastes a little less salty, get the Shiromaru Ramen. After all of us were done eating our ramen, we were given our complimentary tea. According to how the tea tastes, they probably put a little rice water in it. I love rice water, so I can't complain. Overall we had wonderful service here. Next time I'm in the city I'll definitely be coming back for more."
"My go-to Japanese spot in midtown. Their food are cheap and yummy! They have a lot of selections so it's fun to try everything. This is a great place to come with friends and just hang out. They also have TV, so its nice place to catch a game too."
Best japanese food I've had in Brooklyn. We love it so much we're there once or twice a week. Recommendations: -Their sashimi are very fresh: they sometimes have a scallop special topped with uni! must try. Â Also try their rolls or taco style sushi. - I would also recommend the garlic fried chicken and of course the pork belly Udon. Very friendly staff and cosy place. enjoy!
"At these prices it better be good, but it was EXCELLENT! Our server was so knowledgable about the food & wine. It was a nice slow paced dinner we enjoyed thoroughly. Food was perfection. All these reviews complaining about the prices are annoying. If it's not in your budget then you better stick to Olive Garden."
"Hands down, my fave dinner spot. I typically don't like tapas style meals - especially Japanese tapas, but if they didn't have this kind of set up, I'd be sad I'd have to pass up on all the delicious menu items I wouldn't be able to try. (DAT UNI CROQUETTE, YO) The ambiance is super chill. I love feeling like I'm eating at a friend's apartment instead of a stuffy, pretentious little restaurant. The whiskey based cocktails are delicious. I can't speak for the others because I've never tried. That matcha whiskey cocktail reminds me of a signature drink at a nearby bar. Their tasting menu is a great deal, but I also recommend venturing off and trying other things not included on it. I'm also not into branzino, since many other restaurants have ruined the fish for me, but their branzino's quite well done. The washyu steak is super moist despite the names of the cut so splurge a little and treat yourself. In terms of food, most of the items on the menu are quite heavy, so you get full easily but the flavors are well balanced. My fave items aside from the ones already listed are the short rib sashimi, foie gras sushi, and mac & cheese."
"A steaming ramen kitchen with a few chairs, not enough, and many hungry mouths to feed. Â Come join the merry ruckus of bowls and slurps and banter. Â  It's like a food truck you can sit inside. Â People come and go. Â  I order the spicy basic with an extra egg. Â I favor the wheat noodles. Â The dumplings are great too but I Â barely have room for half the ramen so I dont tend to order anything else. Â  If you come alone you can usually cut the line of couples waiting for a spot and squeeze yourself into one of the often empty third seats at a window counter or the kitchen counter. Â  Â  Â You cant really have the blues when you've got your face over a nourishing steamy fragrant bowl of ramen at Minca. Â  At peak hours there is a wait. Â With so few seats they need to be able to have a high turnover rate. Â I try to be considerate and efficient about ordering and paying. Â Bring cash."
"So, I went here after my lesson at the Trapeze School of New York. Â If you read that review, you'll see that the experience was uber stressful so I was really looking forward to the vodka lemonade. Â it totally hit the spot and was strong enough to quickly lighten the mood but not too strong to make you thoroughly understand you're quelling the heaty spiciness of the Cajun cuisine with actual vodka. Â To me, this was perfect. Â  I liked the place a lot and thought it was cool but I don't know if it's like soo worth the hype I picked up on these reviews. Â Maybe it's cause I went to New Orleans a few weeks ago and jambalaya and gumbo just seem par for the course now. Â I'm not sure. Â I went with the waitress's suggestion (which I elicited from her) and got the blackened catfish rubbed with N'awlins spices. Â it was really good and the fish was perfectly moist and delicious (and I'm not a fish person usually). Â I choose the jambalaya as a side dish (I was really excited this was an option), it had andouille and tasted just like the jambalaya I got from a street stand in nola. Â This is not an insult nor an overly effusive compliment. My favorite part of the meal were probably the basket of skinny sweet potato fries we shared. Â I love shoestring salty fries like this so they were perfect. Â  I'd definitely go back because it's a great, laid back, chill dining experience with lots of great drinks to try and some spicy options that you don't often find on a typical menu. Â Next time I'll try the wings!"
"3.5 stars: Good, but not all it was hyped up to be. This place was in my bookmarks for quite some time. Â Being from San Francisco, I love eating Filipino breakfast. Â So, I've been trying to find a good place to get silogs. Â  The day my friends and I were here, they were wrapping up a food network/cooking channel show/interview. Â Therefore, it was still pretty hectic and crowded. Â (Yes, that was a while ago. Â I'm guilty for having this sit in my drafts for so long.) Having read a few reviews, we decided to get the chicken and waffles, sigsig, and tosilog. Â Everything was good, but not as great as the reviewer made it out to be. Â I do have to give them credit for creativity on the chicken & waffles though. Â I've never had ube waffles. Since there aren't many Filipino restaurant to choose from, I would probably return. Â If you're in Brooklyn, Umi Nom also serves silogs during lunch time, just saying. yelp.com/biz/umi-nom-broâ€¦"
"Ordered a beef noodle soup and some pan-fried pork dumplings to share. The dumplings weren't that great, but they were edible. The beef noodle soup was rather good. The hand-pulled noodles were chewy and cooked well. The beef soup was light and not overly salty. However, just as we were starting to dig in to our meal, we overheard a girl come up to one of the waiters and tell him that they found a cockroach in their food. Sigh. Needless to say, we didn't have much appetite after that. We finished our food, uneasily. Ignorance is bliss."
"Finally! After all the hubbub and hoopla, I had a slice of Artichoke's pizza. I'm not a big fan of pizza to begin with, but that first bite blew me away. I gotta admit Artichoke was pretty good. I had their signature artichoke pie. A behemoth of a pizza pie. The dough was a bit thicker than I'd like, but a great big crust is needed to hold up all that dense topping, which was very very rich. The cheese was heavy and creamy and loaded with spinach and artichoke. It was gooey and oozing and bubbling. One slice was nearly too much for me. I barely finished it. Massive. I can see why Artichoke is popular, but it'll be awhile before I head back. The pizza really is too rich for my taste buds. review 5/18/2008 I.M.Y."
"GIST: Great bar over all. Drink selection, service, food, atmosphere are great for dates or casually going out on the weekend and meeting people. This is one of my favorite bars in the city, so given that bias, here are the good things about it. The drink selection is great: the cocktails they make are fantastic and diverse so it's easy to find something you like. The bartenders/servers are very knowledgeable Â about the drinks they provide, and are more than willing to help you find something to your tastes. I usually go during the week when its a bit quieter, but unlike many cocktail lounges I've been to, towards the weekend the place actual fills up with a bit of a scene. People were friendly and willing to chat. It did get a bit crowded, but not too much that you couldn't walk. One of the coolest things about the menu is the 'build your own cocktail': this has 5 categories that make up a cocktail and you pick an element from each category and they improv a drink for you. A lot of good cocktail lounges will make drinks to order, but having the lists in front of you is great for the inexperienced who may not know they're interested in a cocktail that's 'smooth, herbacious, gin based with cucumber and mint'. This can be a lot of fun on dates! The food is surprising good, I had the duck nachos and will again, however I can't speak to much else at this point. Downsides, it's not the cheapest bar by any means but there are more expensive similar bars. It can get a bit noisy in the back when it fills up."
"Came here by a suggestion from a Korean friend. Â She says it's her go-to Korean place in Manhattan so I had to try it out. Â I ordered the pork Bibimbap and it came piping hot in the stone bowl. Â Being the newb that I am, I started digging in immediately. Â The waiter kindly told me to pour their special soy sauce (which came in a small sauce plate at the beginning, so I had no idea they were together) and to mix it all up first. Â All in all, the bowl was delicious! Â A bit too oily, but perhaps I just poured way too much of that soy sauce, and there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. Â It came with some awesome appetizers and their homemade tofu, which looks pretty disgusting but tastes surprisingly good! Portions are a bit small for the price, but I guess that's just Korean food in general."
"*Shady restaurant alert!* Everyone touts the ""Cheap happy hour"" prices and specials. And we used to love Obao! I saw from reviews they tend to ""bait and switch"", as in you bring a group for happy hour and then ""dont have happy hour"" or dont offer it without you asking for it (shameful) .... Anywho, we were going to have our monthly office happy hour here this week and we reached out to Jennifer/Events department for the menu since our office manager needs to OK it....*crickets* it took me 3 emails just to get a response on drink specials and then again *crickets*... 5 emails later it appears jennifer doesnt want our business or the bait and switching they have a reputation for is indeed true. Its such a shame they have to be so shady."
"Very cute vegetarian place with the Queens/Astoria hipper than hip crowd eating there. They have a long communal table that forces you to sit a bit closer to others than you may like, however it also pushes you to have a more ""family"" style dining experience. I've only been here for brunch, so I cannot comment on dinner, but it was good. Coffee was very good, the potato cake and eggs I ordered was also good, not excellent but good. My friend had the Mac&Cheese and I tried it, OH HEAVENLY CHEEZ was it good! That's what I'll get next time. Service was a bit lacking, but i will go ahead and attribute that to the fact that the place was rather packed and the two servers seemed to have their hands full. Loved the vibe, cozy, cute, young. Will go again! Perhaps next time to read a book and have some tea, or wine. Go."
"A little corner of Provence in the middle of Williamsburg. Ah, that brings me back to the good food and cicadas and lavender fields of South France... Adored with whimsical Provencal decor, this place is cosy and comfy for lunch, dinner, or just a snack. Food is authentic, simple and delicious to the last bite, crepes are amazing and creative (both savory & sweet), owner and waiters are very friendly and helpful. I had Savoyarde crepe with bacon, camembert and potatoes - I could not wish for anything better! If you want a quick break from ordinary and enjoy simple French food - this one is a must."
"why? i went here for a business lunch and was completely underwhelmed. maybe it was what i ordered (a rueben sandwich). perhaps if i had the chicken pot pie, i would've rated higher. Â there's nothing about this restaurant that makes me want to go back, sorry george washington."
"While visiting NY my family and I tried them out. Â Food was tasty, nice flavor but a little over priced. Empanadas were small for the price...as a person that eats Colombian food regularly a bit pricey. Â Plus the food was also pre-made. Service was very slow, not very helpful and a little rude. I gave them a high rating because of the flavor. If you're in a hurry not the place to come to. One thing I found very interesting is how they added 18% gratuity right of the top four a group of 4."
"This place wasn't bad. I came here on a Wednesday night, it was packed but we were able to get a table by the window. We ordered the risotto and the grilled calamari. Both were good tasting, the risotto was a bit salty but had good flavor. What I didn't like about this place was the fact that they are cash only and didn't have a sign stating that anywhere. Also the hostess was rather rude to us. The food was good but nothing to write home about."
"German speaking employees? Check. German and Austrian beers? Check. Schnitzel and sausages? Check. Cafe Katja has a small menu ranging from dishes from $12 to the low $20s. Â They have a small selection of brews (not the most extensive I've seen in the city) and the do serve liter beers which is an absolute requirement for any German speaking establishment. Â I ordered the Berner sausages which is essentially a cheese stuffed sausage wrapped in bacon, served with an arugula salad, and cucumber potato salad served up with two pieces of bread chopped into rectangles. Sausages: flavorful, natural casing, but the density of the sausage was way too soft, it actually took some force with the serrated knife to actually cut because it was that rubbery. Â That consistency with the knife was strange but it didn't detract from the dish at all. Â The cucumber potato salad with dill was pretty uninspiring, the cucumber was limp and floppy being drowned in the sauce and it was not the best potato salad I've ever had, not even close. Â Once again, it wasn't bad, just meh, ok, at least it wasn't bad. Â The arugula salad was similar, nothing but arugula and a ho hum dressing. Â The bread was the worst and they seriously get no nos for this, it was 100% absolutely no doubt about it, stale. Â  Overall, great space, reasonably priced beers, and a good place to chill out and get some decent food. Â Best Austrian restaurant in the city? Â Maybe, but it certainly didn't compare to the food I had in Austria."
"MY TOP MOST FAV in NYC for soba. So many diff things to choose from their menu. Everything is perfect from appetizers to desserts- love their black sesame ice cream. Yes, its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Love Love Love Soba-ya."
"I want to give it 3 stars for the price (Mac and cheese at that? A couple chicken lollipops, really?) but the food is. Really. Good. Great burger with a special sauce. Bomb rigatoni mac and cheese --nice breadcrumb crust and bacon. Serious bread pudding. Even delivers well."
"I always go with one other person, split pork buns, then order a ramen each (we'll split one ramen only if we're both not that hungry) - usually Akamaru Modern, or karaka men if I want a spicy kick. The pork buns are amazing, and ramen pretty good too - I'm just honestly not a huge ramen fan. For only $2 you can get a second serving of noodles, so if you have a big appetite you should plan on doing that and conserve your broth a little :) I don't really mind the wait that much. First of all, I'm careful to go earlier (5/6PM) for a shorter wait. Also, since it's near soho you can just do some browsing and/or shopping for 30-60min while you wait for your alert text."
"Knew I just had to visit this place if I came to Chinatown and man am I glad I did! I came here around 10 pm and I was super lucky that there was only a couple that was in front of me ordering and no one sitting around. Otherwise the place probably only had enough seats for 3 people inside. I ordered 2 servings of the famous dollar dumplings that are 1 dollar for four, chicken soup dumplings, and the hot & sour soup (Yes I ate a lot!). Let me tell you that these dumplings are NOT your average small dumplings, they are one of the biggest dumplings you can find. Skeptical that it mustn't taste all that great since it's already so cheap and big portioned, I was blown away by the aromatic filling and juices. The pork and chives dumplings are just the way I like them, very meaty and not too much chives that overpowers the delicious juices from the meat. The crust is also nice with just the perfect amount of crisp from being fried. The chicken soup dumplings sort of tripped me up because I assumed it to be a dumpling that is very soupy, but it was actually soup with dumplings. Nonetheless, the chicken dumplings were great as well, filled with meat and other veggies. The hot and sour soup is your standard, but it's way cheaper than anywhere you can find so get your fix here if you are craving it! Prosperity dumpling will always have a place in my heart :P"
"BRUNCH DAY BRUNCH DAY YAYY!! I love trying new boozy brunch spots that have a fixed price for unlimited drinks. I like that this place does shared dishes too. It made it easy for my group of 4 to try a bunch of different dishes. We all had the raspberry, white-peach bellini's which were pretty yummy. I can't totally say I feel that I got my money's worth drinking-wise, but that was Gina our waitresses fault (more on her later...) As 4, we were able to order 2 starters, 2 side and 2 pizzas. Top hits: - Spicy Fennel Sausage Pizza (biggest hit) - Frittata of the Day - French Toast (the berry compote was AWESOME) Although all the food was delicious, we didn't leave much left over. The decor of this place is fabulous, it's brightly lit, has a massive skylight and is very aesthetically pleasing. The vibe was fun, light and not too loud either. Alright, the downside. I cannot get over how unpleasant our waitress was. She was not friendly, polite, helpful or thankful. She was not attentive (until it came to pay), barely checked on how we were doing and awful at refilling our drinks. She dropped off the bill without saying thank you and picked up our signed receipts without saying thank you, all while we sat there and finished our drinks. One of my group had brought in an outside water bottle. Our waitress Gina, asked her to empty her water bottle into her water glass and told her she would take the empty bottle away. Umm hello? Does this seem weird to anyone but me? My friend said it's okay, you can take the water bottle. She said can you empty it first? It was bizarre, and a bit rude. I'm really not one to rip of service, especially for a brunch place that offers an all you can drink option, because I understand it's a lot of work to be on top of all of your tables, but we asked for refills and waiting at least 10 minutes before she remembered and saw that we were ALL empty. I'd come back here, but if I saw this waitress, I'd request to move."
"The tasting menu is well worth the $40 with dish after dish of food to try. Â This is supposed to be a mexican spot but I didn't really sense it through most of the food besides the tacos and churros. Â I enjoyed the lamb meatballs, the chicken liver, the duck and the churros the most. Â I think they could have done away with the first plate of mini veggies and the cheesy dish later on. Â But overall, this place is a nice change."
"Yelp tells me that there are 15+ places to get ramen within a 1km radius of this place which, apart from blowing my mind, makes me feel slightly unqualified to review. A true mission to get to the East Village when struck with sudden jet lag to the point of exhaustion, coupled with the humid depths of the subway, the words ""this ramen better be amazing"" were definitely uttered (more than once.) The friendly waitress and gyoza did wonders to improve our state of mind, and after that it's a bit of a ramen-induced haze. Big ups for the suggestions re: noodle type for each different ramen (even if my friend chose to ignore.) I guess the only way to make a fair judgement on the ramen itself is to try the other 14, right?"
"The shabu shabu and Motsu pot are amazing, you can taste from the soup base that they spent a great amount of time preparing all the materials. please don't waste your money ordering a salad when you are here! eat salad when your home."
"Let me tell you, eating the lobster Mac n cheese was the best thing I could have ever done for my taste bud! Pure heaven! The lobster roll was great too. Reminds me of Martha's Vineyard! I think I will treat myself here every wk!"
"I have a love and hate relationship with Eataly. I love the concept but hate the crowds. I love the food, coffee and grocery items but hate the prices. I love the beautiful, ornate building in which it's located but hate it how it resembles a labyrinth where I sometimes have a hard time finding my way around or out. The highlights include: - excellent coffee - outstanding selection of olive oils (in fact, I've yet to find better) - an out of this world hand-made pasta counter - a fun (and covered!) beer garden & micro brewery A friend of mine compared Eataly to IKEA - a large windowless space where customers are trapped, unaware of the passing of time, destined to spend a lot more than they intended to... She has a point but at least the merchandise will likely be delicious and won't require assembly based on simple yet complicated instructions."
"Well... Apparently there are some good spots to eat in near times sq. This is truly a hidden gem. Really hidden. When you get to the address, don't go to the Japanese place on the street - go down to the basement and reach your true destination. The place is small and cozy, with a nice sit on bar. Almost everything we ordered was really good. Especially the meat. And of course the sake. They have a lot of it. The dishes are big and the prices are cheap. What more can you ask?"
"GJC serves up a reasonably priced brunch on weekends. Service was so slowwwwww because they have trouble figuring out who is the hostess and waitress. Â None of which seemed to be happy working there. Â In retrospect, I wish I was seated at the bar where the bartender was more enthusiastic and talkative with the patrons. Â It seemed as if the people sitting at the bar got their food in half the time that I did. Â Also, I was dismayed that they couldn't give me a side order of chicken apple sausage because it was ""mixed in with the order"". Â It's disappointing to go to a cafe and discover that there are no side orders on the menu. Â Expect no seats after a certain hour because this is a very small space."
"Fantastic food! Although, this place is quite ridiculously pricey for a Mexican restaurant (only forgivable cause it's in nyc, where most restaurants are overpriced anyways). Running into some unexpected company, my bf and I decided to meet up for a double dinner date. Mexican was the consensus so we scouted Yelp for the best in the area, and lo and behold, Toloache popped up. Located in Greenwich, amongst other hipster establishments in the backyard of Soho, Toloache is a cozy, modish Mexican restaurant, with wood paneled ""windows"" that probably open up like balcony doors in the summer and dim, intimate lighting. The decor is modern but rustic, clearly a hipster nyc establishment but still paying some homage to Mexican culture. For appetizers, we ordered the Trio de Guacamoles: Three bowls of guac that ranged from sweet and creamy to smokey and spicy. The Tradicional (mild) was your typical guac and my least favorite cause it really didn't pack an oomph and I can barely recall what it tasted like (ingredients: avacado, tomato, onion, cilantro, serrano). The Frutas (medium) was extremely smooth and creamy but also sweet and tart (ingredients: avacado, pomegranate, vidalia onion mango, apple, habanero, thai basil). Finally, my favorite... The Rojo (spicy) was a fantastic blend of spice and smoke, with a hint of sweetness and tartness mixed in, while still maintaining the smoothness of good guac -- multidimensional and absolutely delicious! (ingredients: avacado, tomato, red onion, chipotle queso fresco). It was also great that the waiter made no fuss about refilling our chips, and actually filled it a second time without even being prompted. Â  For an entree, my bf ordered the Enchiladas Borrachas, which I unabashedly stole several bites of... ok, maybe half the plate or more ended up in my stomach. It was that good! Pulled chicken, tomatillo-5 chiles salsa, and borracha mexican cheeses, topped with crema, lettuce, and radish salad... I'm salivating just thinking about it! Spicy and tender chicken, cooked to perfection, wrapped in a heavenly mix of salsa and cheese, then brightened and crisped up with some radish and lettuce, this dish was easily devoured in seconds. My bf left the table for a few seconds to do a restroom run. He came back to find his plate half empty and me surreptitiously stuffing some lettuce in my mouth. Two Enchiladas? No, hun, there was only one all along. Astounded by the steep prices, I ordered a taco appetizer in lieu of an entree: The Carne Asada tacos (marinated beef skirt steak, chipotle salsa, avocado, onions, and cilantro). Like the enchiladas, these tacos were divine -- perfectly cooked beef (juicy and tender and well-marinated), smokey and spicy chipotle salsa, a creamy slice of avocado on top, and some onions, cilantro, and lime to add even more dimension, brightness, and punch to the dish! The best tacos I've ever had in my life were some fresh, authentic, dirt cheap tacos from a Mexican hole-in-the-wall marketplace that my El Salvadorian friend took me to in Texas. Toloache's tacos are the only tacos that have even come close to being comparable to those. Our awesome and unexpected dinner company ordered Pescado tacos (fish tacos), sauteed spicy kale, and Pollo Toloache (chicken toloache). Judging by how quickly their food disappeared from their plates, I'd say those dishes were also big hits! Finally, for dessert, we ordered two plates of churros and proceeded to try to play churro jenga (which, might I add, failed miserably). The manager or maitre d' (someone official looking with slick hair and a nice suit) walked by and noticed, to his and our amusement, that we were attempting churro jenga. Courteous, jovial, and welcoming, he chatted with us for a bit then brought us a round of free tequila shots on the house cause it was our first time at their restaurant. Absolutely stellar service! Food: 4/5 -- Delish by NYC Mexican food standards and ok prices too, by NYC standards. Outside of NYC (say in Texas or Cali), you'll definitely be able to find better Mexican food and prices but as far as Manhattan goes, this is one of your best bets. Service: 5/5 -- Fantastic! Free tequila shots at the end and super attentive and friendly throughout. Atmosphere: 4/5 -- Intimate, cozy, nice dim lighting, modish but still rustic... just your typical hipster abode Overall: 4/5 -- Great place to get solid Mexican food in NYC!"
"Although Lombardi's is rated pretty high on the pizza restaurant scene in NYC, it does not make it on my top ten - granted I prefer the Neapolitan style over everything else (I do NOT even consider ""deep dish"" to be pizza... don't get me started). In the world of NY Style I would say that it would come up on my top five for their nice crispy crust and a really delicious sauce. Go if you live here and want to cross it off of your list - if you have limited time in the city, and are not on a Pizza Tour head a little north-west to Keste, for true Neapolitan style. Â  If you prefer NY over Neapolitan head a little north-west again for Bleecker street pizza which is my favorite. Disclaimer: I have never eaten at John's pizza which I hear is very good but I have had pizza in ever single borough at multiple places."
"4.5. I've been to this place many times because I used to live around the corner. I always got the pad sew eu with tofu which is great & the veggie spring roll & curry puffs are both great starters. This place is reasonably priced & my boyfriend developed a love for Thai food after he went here! The only problem is that they are always busy :/ & the place is tiny! So get there for an early lunch or early dinner & you should be fine. I totally recommend this place, but not for big groups of people."
"LMAO, if you want real arepas go to any Colombian restaurant in queens, this place was so over hyped and over priced totes not worth it, they served me something I could make Â at home, and better. The food wasn't horrible just very disappointing. Oh and no A\C!(this was in mid august) The one thing I did like was that if you give them your number they txt you when a table is open so you don't have to wait, we had a few beers next door for the 35 min wait."
"Plus: The restaurant was able to take reservations 15 minutes before we showed up for 4 people. Downside: The food was mediocre. I recall that everything was really salty. Since Guy Fieri was spotted there, I really expected more, but really wasn't too impressed. It was a shame as I took my brother in law and his girlfriend who crave good Thai food as there aren't much in Slovenia where they live."
"I had the pleasure of placing a large corporate lunch order from Snack the other day. Â The acting manager was extremely helpful, providing recommendations on how much to order for the group and promising to have our meal arrive by 1:30 pm. Â Even though the deliveryman got a bit lost within our building, he still managed to arrive at 1:30 pm on the dot. Â I could not have been happier with the service. Â  The food, itself, was just as impressive. Â  I ordered one of the combination platters to start, choosing the Carp Roe, Roasted Eggplant, and Hummus dips. Â The carp roe spread had a fresh, fishy flavor. Â The eggplant was uniquely smoked and provided a positive grilled after-taste. Â The hummus was some of the creamiest I had ever tasted. Â However, while I enjoyed the silky texture, I would have preferred a bit more flavor from the spread. Â  The accompanying pitas were comfortingly soft and warm. Â The Greek Salad was crisp and fresh, but a bit over-dressed. Â  However, the team was blown away by the tasty Artichoke Chicken Salad, which actually included little lettuce. Â The lack of roughage was compensated for by large hunks of tender chicken, potatoes, butter beans, tomatoes, and string beans. Â This earthy combination was tossed in a savory black olive vinaigrette. Â I also helped myself to a slice of the delicate Spinach Pie. Â The moist phillo dough melted in my mouth, leaving the bold spinach and gooey cheese filling to gratify my taste buds. Â The hearty pie satisfied without being too dense. Â It was also served with our choice of cold appetizer or side Greek salad. Â To top off my order, I purchased a variety of sandwiches, all of which were quite large and priced between $7.50 and $9.50. Â I tried half of the Marinated 1.0 and fell in love with the lemony mix of artichokes, tomatoes, cucumbers, portobello mushrooms, scallions and shaved cheese. Â The Mediterranean ingredients were stuffed into a large, crisp ciabatta roll. Â  This tasty meal solicited cheers from my colleagues...another order well placed by the resident foodie :) Â As I predicted in my conversation with Snack's manager, we will be ordering from this tasty Greek cafe again!"
"The menu has 3 options for spice level: mild, medium, spicy. What the menu fails to tell you is that medium spice level means ""you will loose all taste after one bite"". I can deal with a decent level of spice, but my fried rice and noodles were so spicy i just couldn't enjoy the meal. Additionally, the rice was dry and the sauce used for the noodle was just not good - the dish really lacked the usual thai flavors. Granted I ordered from Seamless, but the experience did not leave me wanting more."
"What can I say? Another hit in Billyburg ;-) We came here on a suggestion by a wine buyer. Apparently, they have a very impressive wine list, but too bad, I didn't have any. I was too busy drinking a Wizard (gin, fernet, burnt fig jam, and ginger ale), which was wonderful. For appetizer, we had 4 oysters, all from the East Coast. Big and creamy. Next, we had the chicken liver pate, and really it was orgasmic. I could eat pate all the time! For entrees, MR had the ravioli and I opted for the pheasant. The pheasant was amazing. Tender and juicy. The cabbage and the latke were just a tad bit too salty for my taste. The ravioli was good, but it wasn't mind blowing. For dessert we had the chocolate caramel tart with sea salt. It was good, but it felt like we were eating taffy and it was impossible to eat with forks. At one point, I wanted to just pick it up with my hands and shove it in my mouth, but that would have been way too barbaric. lol. I also noticed that they sold T-shirts and tote bags. The bathroom: there is an old-fashioned scale in one of the washrooms, so I guess you could weigh yourself BEFORE and AFTER dinner and see what the damage has been..."
"Soup Dumpings & Shanghai Noodles. Those are the only things you need to get when you're here. I think soup dumplings are good in general, but these are really as good as it gets. This is basically the only place you have to come to if you want to show people around NYC or if you're coming as a tourist or if you're just in the mood for some really amazing soup dumplings. The wait is pretty short (there can be a line because it's THAT popular & good), but the food comes out really fast, like EXTREMELY fast. Also, even if it doesn't seem like it, the waiters do understand english pretty well because there are a lot of non-Chinese people that come through the restaurant. However, the menu can get really overwhelming, but I swear you just need to keep ordering soup dumplings and a few plates of Shanghai noodles and you're set to go. There are either crab or pork soup dumplings. I recommend getting both at first and then ordering more of whichever based on your taste. Basically, if you ever get the chance, you HAVE to stop by here at least once in your lifetime cause you're going to keep coming back for more."
"Food: Â Good. Â Just ok. Â The octopus salad started with a promise but didn't follow through. Â The sirloin was- at medium rare, not very good. The sauces were souless. Â Creamed spinach was all cream with strands of spinach. Â  Service: Â Adequate, except our server left (saw her walk out the door with her coat on... and a new server took over). Â He was actually great, however in this industry of hospitality, a simple thank you and good night would have been nice, no? Ambience: Â Ok. Â just ok."
"Another spot on my ""food bucket list"" that did not disappoint. My friend and I met here at 5 on a Friday hoping to dodge the notorious crowd we had read about. Good thing we came when we did because when we left around 7 a wait was forming. First things first - the kitchen doesn't technically open until 5 but you can order chips and guac, which is pretty darn good guac. We each got the watermelon margarita, which was good but honestly a little heavy on the tequila - I've had better. Now for the main course - get the enchiladas verdes. Absolutely phenomenal, and I don't understand the reviews that say the portions here are small - this plate is huge, so if you're hungry, I highly recommend it. The taco plates were smaller (three each), so if you're looking for something lighter, my friend got the steak tacos and enjoyed them. But, back to the enchiladas! The sauce...MMMMMM. Highlight of the dish for me. Will definitely be back!"
"Oh, I just love this place - so many flavors, spices and coconut curries, and quite the menu! I've had lots of roti canai, but theirs is the best - some of my favorites: oyster omelet, Hainanese chicken, chow kueh teow, kariayam, watercress, shrimp with okra, pad thai, and crabs cooked with duck's egg. Everything is excellent - and I recommend going with a huge group so you can try lots of dishes."
It's VERY small so come early and expect a wait. I also don't get it. Paying $15 for three pieces of chicken and a big biscuit. $8 for a chicken cutlet on a big biscuit. And chicken and waffles. dont know how much that was but with two SMALL pieces of pie. for $50. Skin was what made it taste good. It seemed to be cleaned better than most places that I go to. But it wasn't like chicken that i would cross town for.....Which is what I did. The waffles were Blah. I think the kids killed the pies so i can't comment on the taste of those.
"A local Â frequenter of Frankies, most recently the Eggplant Parm (with a requested side of pasta) ran me in the upwards of $20. Expensive? I think so. But it was soooo good. Delicious Italian food in the neighborhood! If you buy the cookbook you can recreate some of the favorites at home (Frankie's sauce is a staple in my house as well as their ceasar dressing and roasted veggies)."
"While this is not the best falafel I have had in the world, IT WAS IN VIENA, AUSTRIA if you can believe that, these guys get points for 1. Being rugged ass falafel guys. They all look like they just got out of some gangster military training. 2. They are all incredibly friendly. On more than one occasion I received a fresh falafel ball to munch on while I wait for my order. 3. Being a true New York experience in Queens!! Let Brooklyn have all the hipster foo foo places! We have you guys!"
"One of my favorites where you can order a slice, other than Artichoke. Their square isn't as good as Artichoke's Sicilian, but they're slice is awesome, especially with the small pepperoni that curls up when cooked. They always serve it piping hot, so be careful and don't burn your mouth-- I do this almost every time. I've never seen it too crowded, so there's always a place to sit."
"My go-to spot in SoHo. Â This is definitely my pizza spot. Because I can get an amazing appetizer, pizza, and NUTELLA dessert. Â Let's just linger on that last point. They have a nutella stuffed dessert. NUTELLAAA. GET IT. You won't be sorry. Or you will be because you just ate a loooot of nutella, but it's worth it. You can go to the gym tomorrow."
"Ooooh I definitely know why this place is so popular. Their hand pulled noodles were simply amazing, the texture was bouncy, soft, and fresh. The broth was kind of unique in a way where I can't describe it because I never really tasted anything like it. Especially when you add vinegar to it ohhhh make that a ++++ dumbs up. My friend got the mount qi beef hand pulled noodles which is in a spicy broth also has a taste of sourness from the vinegar they originally put in. This was their special one and it didn't disappoint us with a cost of $5.75. They serve in large quantities, good quality of the noodles for a decent price you pay. Who doesn't like that? When you first come in, place looks shabby and all but good food doesn't only serve from expensive formal restaurants. This place is also good for a late night meal, I'd definitely come here again!"
Amazing! Â Some of the best fries with a huge variety of dipping sauces! Â The Rosemary Garlic Mayo and Sundried Tomato Mayo are to die for! Not a lot of seating though.
"Wow. We came here as a last minute decision due to the yelp reviews and weren't disappointed! We had 5 dishes, including scallops on a butternut squash risotto, tuna tartar w/ japanese eggplant, lamb tenderloin, strawberry baby back ribs and broccoli rabe with toast fried egg with mushrooms... all delicious. Dessert we had the panna cotta which was excellent and ended the meal with bacon glazed donut with a coffee ice cream... possibly the best dish of the night. Well worth it. Waiter was attentive and approachable. Will come again, especially as their menu changes everyday."
"This a place I definitely return to on a frequent basis. Their famous watercress sald is definitely worth the hype. Every dish I've had was delicious and freshly made. No matter what we get, we always order a side of their coconut rice...yummmmmms. I have not been lucky enough to find coconut ice cream the last 2 times but I will keep trying..as it's top notch!"
"I enjoy al fresco brunch dining at this restaurant. Fitting with the restaurant's neighborhood, my waitress was tatted up and likely the first Wiccan I've met in New York. The prices for bellinis and mimosas are reasonable. The food here is Moroccan-influenced, so they have some unique options on their brunch menu for those who are looking to try something other than eggs benedict and pancakes."
"We were looking for fish tacos in the area and happened upon this highly reviewed spot on Yelp so we had to try it. Â The good: It's a Cuban diner type of restaurant and has a great variety of tasty foods to choose from; and they open until 5:30am in the weekends. Â The bad: The 2 $$ signs are misleading. They have small tapas-like items, such as empanadas, fish tacos and the like but they are overpriced. We got 2 mini fish tacos for $10. Â Of course, we expected them to be bigger, especially for $10! The entrees are $18-25 and average sized. This place should have 3 $$$. I got the oxtail empanadas and fish tacos and even w/ a free check-in soft drink, had to pay over $20. Â A meal w/ a small appetizer will cost you $30 easy at this spot. Also, the waitress gave us an attitude after she clearly got our order wrong and then didn't even wait on us the rest of the meal. That put a bad taste in our mouths. So overall, I give this place 3 stars. (Oh, I just laughed while reading other reviews on this place. THEY HAVE LINTY CLOTH NAPKINS. I walked out of the restaurant and found all this white lint on my pants. No bueno.)"
"I went to Katsu-Hama with my mom and sister tonight after we had a serious hankering of katsu curry. I'm glad to say that the katsu curry was THE BOMB, and that other curry/katsu entrees the customers ordered looked delicious when I looked around. Yes, I am a snoop, but I don't blatantly stare. More like peer through while in my katsu curry heaven. :) There's something almost buttery about the curry that is rich, flavorful. It's got a hint of spice-- not Indian-food spicy, but a slight kick that gives it oomph and doesn't fall flat. The rice is home-style, and the katsu.... Would delectable even begin? It's tender and moist, with a breaded and crusty exterior that is soft but doesn't fall apart when you cut through it with a spoon or chopsticks. Their shredded cabbage and house dressing are also delicious--balanced and nuanced, without overpowering one another. Despite such heavenly food, I need to go down to earth and dock a star for one thing: they fail at giving water to customers. I'm a pretty laid-back person overall-- shit happens. But when it comes to water, I'm getting it. After a tortorous encounter at Yeah Shang Hai Deluxe Corp where it took 20 minutes to get water, I have put my foot down that all joints should at least give water and keep pouring them when they see empty glasses. Granted, if you ask here, it looks like they'll give it to you without a problem, but that slow response is a peeve of mine. Nevertheless, generally friendly waitstaff, excellent food, great ambience and decor while rocking the yellow/orange walls that I'll go with small groups or a friend. Probably better for up to five people, but any bigger then that and you'll have to call for reservations."
"Spacious, nice staff, great food (patatas bravas were a bit dry but otherwise very good). They were very friendly and generous about the drinks, and quick great service. A fun time - and music was not too loud! Definitely recommend."
um...why are you still reading reviews. go to beyond sushi. NAO.
"Never have I dealt with such a rude delivery man before. Apparently he didn't get the updated tip. We ordered 35 pies and when I got downstairs to guide him upstairs, he gave me such a nasty attitude. I didn't place the order so I wasn't aware of the charges. He showed me how much tip he got and said ""I think you should send 4 people down to get these pies because I'm not carrying it"" Well he had no choice because he is the delivery man for a reason right? Apparently he didn't get the memo of an additional $30 tip after the order was placed. He was so rude and when we got upstairs, he tossed the pies onto the table. 1 star for customer service."
"Dinner around 6pm was perfect because it wasn't crowded but still had a Â charming setting. Â Many delicious choices on the menu but our waitress immediately recommended the sea bass. Â  We also ordered the mac and cheese tart and the brussels sprouts as sides. Â All I can say is that fish is delish! Â I am huge artichoke fan so that was the first thing that gave this meal extra points...it had yummy crispy artichokes with a fennel potato puree. Â Also, the little dollop of avocado on top was very unassuming but so flavorful. Â This was really done nicely and I was extremely impressed. Now the sides, why order brussel sprouts?! Â The one vegetable that everyone hates. Â Oh but no when you roast them with caramelized apples and pancetta...you want seconds...yes you do. Â Truffle mac and cheese tart was more like a mac and cheese biscuit sandwich but who cares it was also delish. Overall, this meal was a 10. Â I will be back. Â Fo' sho'"
"Great value, huge (slight overwhelming) menu options, surprisingly good service, and the food was overall good. Â The pork belly skewer was a 3 star, the fried squid was a 2 very chewy and slightly unswallowable Â star, the cabbage with pork belly and miso sauce was a delicious 5 star, hamachi yellowfin was 4 star, and pasta with roe cream sauce 4.5 star. The restaurant is tiny and blink and you'll miss the door leading down. Â Wedged between a couple other Japanese restaurants ... make sure you go to the right spot. Â Cool atmosphere with many groups."
"The reason I am giving Joe's Shanghai a 2 and not a 3 is this: 1. Â The wait is too long ....and they call number's out then say ""just checking"" as a way to update their waiting list... but it is a big tease when you have been waiting for an hour and are hungry! 2. Â The soup dumplings were good, but they the dough was very thin and therefore broke too easily... Â it is no fun losing more than half of the soup of a soup dumpling! Â I did like that they had the vinegar that goes onto it already on the table when you arrive though."
"Let me just say, this 5 star review belittles all my other 5 star reviews. Â This is a culinary experience for the books. Â A beautiful symphony of flavors in every dish. Â I went with my parents, so here's all the dishes that were ordered Appetizers Hand Rolled Farfalle Crispy Lamb Belly Entrees Salmon special Fiddle Head Fern Agnolotti Tea Smoked Duck Breast Dessert Rhubarb Sundae Roasted Plum Strudel Each dish was so amazing in its own way. Â All the components of each dish worked together in a single bite to create a harmonious composition of flavors that overwhelmed the senses. Â I would go as far to say that this is the best restaurant I've been to in NYC and possibly ever. Â Before you die, go to this restaurant."
"Came here on a Saturday evening at around 7pm with a friend and shared the cheese croquettes and BXL SpÃ©cial moules-frites. Delicious food, excellent service, and very nice ambience. Would definitely come back!"
"This place has one of the best roast pork (cha siew) and roast duck! Although it could get crowded during prime lunch/dinner time, the wait is usually pretty quick. They are one of those quick authentic cantonese cuisine. I love their cha siew, so I always come here to get their cha siew lai fun (roast pork with pearl noodles). Yummmmm!"
"Fantastic brunch spot. Love the ambiance and portion sizes, everything is just right. If I lived in the neighb (and I WISH I did!!!) I'd be a regular."
"Holy freaking cow bells ringing! Â This place is off the chain like nobody's business of fixed gear hipsterism! Â Everything is gewdy gewd gewd. Â Everything I ate was like crack. Â I was pretty sure the chefs thought replacing MSG with crack would get people to love their stuff and write half-literate Yelp reviews because they were Yelping under the influence (""YUI""). Â Don't tell the po-pos round the block! I came here for a friend's birthday. Â 5ive of us. Â All dudes. Â All hungry. Â All selfish. Â We ordered, ate, and died, revived, ate, burped, and died. Â This is a place where hunger pangs come to get gang banged. Â And it will be so gewd. Â Holy freaking cow bell, will it be so gewd. Â Why, yes. Â Yes, it will. There are some staples that you have to order to ensure a good time, although I do think most of their menu is crack laden enough that you shouldn't be able to go wrong with any selection. Â Roti Canai is obviously a must. Â It's kinda like naan from an Indian restaurant but lighter, fluffier, with a better tasting dipping sauce. Â You will seriously dip the sh*t out of your Roti. Â It will be excellent. Â Char Koay Teow, Beef Rendang, Chicken Rice, Coconut Rice, and Crispy Fried Squid are also all very delicious and you can't go wrong. Â Apparently the Seafood Scramble Egg Chow Fun is also good but I was not able to get that. Â The one thing I didn't really like was the Hainanese Chicken because it's just wet. Â Like its kind of like poached chicken with the skin still on an intact chicken. Â No pulled meat. Â Just wet. Â I don't like wet chicken. Â  I will come here again and again and again. Â It's definitely a place you will bring your out of town friends, unless they're tourists. Â The only way they're not tourists is if you yourself are not a tourist. Â That means that you needed to have lived in one of the five boroughs for at least three years. Â Actually, if you live in Manhattan you need to have lived here for at 5 years to qualify as a non-tourist. Â If you live in Brooklyn/Queens, then 3, though if you live in Williamsburg or Brooklyn Heights or Long Island City, then it's still 5. Â Bronx and Staten Island are both half a year. Â If you decide to live in NJ or Long Island or CT, you will forever be a tourist, unless you first lived in one of the aforementioned boroughs. Â Get that visa!"
"LOVE Almond for Brunch. Â  Been here twice now and each time, the brunch was just delicious. Â I love how they separate the menu into sweet, egg, salads, etc. Â Being a savory lover, I am in love with all the egg options. Â Favorite: Almond Hash. Â It is simply DELICIOUS. Â I've also had the pastrami (yummy but I felt too full after this!), huevos rancheros (lovely), and chicken sausage + eggs (very good but not as unique). Â All were good but the Almond Hash is the shining star. Â Pieces of duck meat mixed up with potatoes with 2 perfectly poached eggs on top. Â How can you go wrong? This restaurant is VERY foursquare happy. Â If you check in, it's likely you'll get something."
"3 AM and tipsy = Amazing Artichoke pizza is the place to go. In and out ... wait actually nope not really.. Expect a 15-20 minutes wait, but very well worth it. It melts in your mouth, I'm not the biggest pizza person, but this is just so so so good And zepolles and fried desserts are right next door. :)"
A little upset about not getting the complimentary bread basket with our Saturday brunch. The food was good. The place was packed (to be expected)... definitely recommend reservations. Nice decor.
"Sadly this was my favorite pizza in nyc since I was a child. It would be where I would bring out of row era to prove that nyc has the best pizza hands down! I let this place make look bad 3 times before I stopped coming. It's not even a shell of what it once was. Less cheese and sauce has created an under flavored visually unappealing bite of crap! Tourist that now flock here by the bus load due to their reputation, sadly all they get to say after is that they has a slice from the oldest pizza place in the country. They once could just say they had the best pizza ever... No more!"
"As my quest to find the best burger continues, Â I may have found the holy grail of Burgers and possibly ended the quest. The burger was so moist and juicy, cooked to perfection at medium. Â Just the basic condiments and toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and ketchup. Â This burger needs nothing more; anything else would just detract from its grilled beefy goodness."
"Really great Korean place in Midtown. If you need recovery food from a weekend of debauchery, this might be the place to cure it. Service is spotty, but mostly good, and everything is super clean (unlike a lot of other nearby eateries). I'd recommend the bbq meats over the bibimbap, and you can probably go spicier than it's listed if you dig hotter foods."
1.5 hour wait but the ramen and broth are definitely MSG-free and natural. The seating can be cramped but it's worth visiting.
"First time I've had Malaysian and I wanted to try some standard Malay dishes. We had the Indian mee goreng, haianese chicken, roti, and malaysian ice tea. The malaysian ice tea was like a thai tea, but sweeter. Everyone gets at least one order of the roti and why should we stray from everyone else? The delicious fried bread was served with a little bowl of chicken curry. Definitely a good way to whet the appetite. The Indian mee goreng was I'm assuming an indian inspired version of the standard mee goreng. When the Hainanese chicken came out, we thought they had given us the wrong thing because the chicken was yellow. Yellow like it had been cooked in yellow curry. I figured it was due to the type of chickens they were using. The chicken was still good and it was even better with the sauce that came along side it. I got a side of the rice and it was a perfect compliment to it. 3.5 stars for me. My friends tell me it was a lot better when it was in the old location, but I have nothing to compare it to."
"I'm slowly starting to sample the Malaysian cuisine that New York has to offer, and Nyonya did not disappoint! We ordered all the classics: Roti canai for appetizer, beef rendang, and my absolute favorite Chinese-Malay dish Chow Koay Teow. The roti canai was delicious, fluffy and light and nicely complimented by the curry dipping sauce. The beef rendang was also delicious, each piece of beef tender and juicy. The only thing was the Chow Koay Teow - it was good and had a decent amount of shrimp and squid in it, but lacked the spicy, fluffy (almost airy, not oily or sticky) quality that excellent Chow Koay Teow should have. We finished with a cendol for dessert. It was nice and had a rich nutty coconut flavor. I was excited that there was ABC on the menu, but my dining companion had reservations about a dessert with corn in it. Next time! Tip: cash only!"
Pretty good lunch option if you go there earlier and beat the crowd (and before the food gets old). It gets crowded sometimes but you can usually still get a seat. Lunchbox is pretty good and comes with soup or salad. I don't recommend going there for dinner though. The food tasted a bit old around dinner time.
"A few months ago, I made reservations here for a very special 30th birthday celebration dinner for Thompson and a few friends. T and I always wanted to try the pork butt from Momofuku, but never found a good opportunity to celebrate, or an awesome group to share with until now. Since I wanted to secure the time and date, I placed a special order for the Bo Ssam (which means pork wrap) a month in advance. Despite the name, pork butt doesn't actually come from the rear end of the pig. It is one of the two cuts from the pork shoulder. Butt or not, we wanted it. The skin of the pork butt was glazed in brown sugar and sweet deliciousness. The meat was mouthwateringly tender, moist, and drenched in absolute tastiness. To make the perfect wrap, you'll need a good ratio of everything. With the crisp and buttery lettuce leaves for wrapping, a good bite of rice, a generous spoon of the savory ginger sauce, a little bit of kimchi, and a slab of flavorful meat. And... voilÃ ! The combination of all the ingredients created a great medley of sweet, savory, spicy, cold and hot! Everyone was able to eat about 4 -5 wraps, and it was enough for everyone to be full and extremely happy. We couldn't stop raving about how good the meal was. It was delicious, plentiful, and engages the entire table in conversation and interaction. For $200, the Bo Ssam fed all 10 of us, not including tax and tip. If you don't mind losing a couple days of your lifespan to gastronomical delight, you should definitely try it with a party of 6-10 (10 guests maximum) who will appreciate all the porky goodness.

Great to have a Vietnamese restaurant in the Village! Their bhan mi is delicious. Good bread. Pho is ok...nothing to go crazy over but not bad either. They have cucumber juice which is really good mixed with the lemonade. It's $4 and seems crazy paying that for a drink at a place where you can get a big sandwich for $5 but it's worth it and goes really well with the sandwich!
"Excellent place for brunch. My friends and I shared the homemade biscuits and donuts as an appetizer. I would definitely recommend the biscuits. The donuts were good but nothing to rave about. As per the server's suggestion, I went for the signature dish: the meatloaf and 2 eggs, which came with french fries. The meatloaf was delicious and filling."
"Get: ~corn (4.5 stars): roasted corn with queso and cayenne. Corn was sweet, balanced nicely by the crumbly cheese, ending with a kick from the cayenne. So glad it wasnt overhyped, but I love corn, so I might be a bit biased. $2 ~Cuban (4 stars): with fresh roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and chipotle mayo. I normally dislike Cuban sandwiches, but this was so exceptional! Â All the meats tasted fresh, without any of that briny supermarket or boars head taste. Chipotle mayo was delicious, and I only wished theyd put more pickles in it. $6.50 ~cafe con leche, iced (4 stars): a bit nutty, just strong enough, chilled me down on such a humid day and yet rejuvenating at the same time. Not too sweet, either. $3.50 Note: I went to the little ""take out"" one right next door. Its cheaper, and the wait is only for them to make the food!"
"Honestly, I think I would rather eat at The Hummus and Pita Co more often than Chipotle... Although Chipotle is closer, I wouldn't mind traveling to the west side to have a Mediterranean lunch. Seriously, what more can you ask for when you're given hummus and pita in a meal? I tried the Falafel Pita with fried eggplant and a lottttt of toppings. For $6, you can't go wrong. The only negative thing is that the service is a bit unorganized, with orders skipping each other. And my spinach quiche wasn't heated properly..."
"Review for service only....DiFaro's I've heard so much about you, but sadly it wasn't meant to be. I ordered and didn't mind the hour the lady at the front said it would take to get my pie. An hour came and went, I was told a half hour more. I don't care how good it's supposed to be, I was getting impatient. The last straw was when I asked if the pizza had even gone into the oven, an hour and 45 minutes into it, and she snapped at me for being impatient. Don't tell customers 1 hour when you mean 2+, just lemme know what I'm getting myself into! Terrible system and customer service. Not to say I didn't gain anything, I got bit by Mosquitos or bed bug or idk what those crawly things were. HORRIBLE SERVICE!"
"I love Supper and its sister restaurants, Lil Frankie's and Frank's! I've only been to Supper for dinner, but they have great pastas, dessert, and wine. It's a great atmosphere, and service is great. There's also a private back wine room for functions."
"For a bar whose bartenders make fancy drinks and claim to specialize in whiskey cocktails, I was disappointed to have one mediocre whiskey and ginger concoction and one piss poor excuse for a Sazerac (pretty much tasted like bottom shelf whiskey, no absinthe or herbsaint, no sugar or bitters, and it was warm). Â Would have expected a slightly larger crowd for a Friday night, but I was more annoyed about the drinks than anything else. Â At least the table service was pleasant and attentive. Â The bouncer was a cool dude too. This bar is definitely nothing to write home about, and there's a zillion other bars in Tribeca that are better than this. Â I suppose coming here is better than not drinking at all, but not by much."
"gloomy interior, albeit with comfy seating so-so service 1 bottle of (only polish!) vodka in the whole house wtf? not as expensive as i anticipated forgettable venue"
"Now that Rafaela's Cafe is closed, Pepe Giallo is the last affordable yet charming place I know of to eat in Chelsea. You can get their most basic pastas for about $8, and the portions are not meager. The rest of the menu is well done if not exactly mind blowing and nothing is really priced at break the bank levels. The seating inside is largely communal table, so scout ahead if you plan to come with a group. The food comes quickly and service is brisk, so if you are planning to wax poetic for a few hours over your one glass of wine, be prepared to get a few looks thrown your way. Now that its springtime try to get a seat in their backyard patio, best seats in the house."
"The food here is amazing and so so cheap. I had the sesame noodles which were amazing. The scallion pancakes were kind of dry. I would pass on those next time. The vegetable bun was great and the lamb noodle soup was very flavorful. The boiled vegetables dumplings were also delicious, but I think next time I'd like to try the fried ones, which looked so good. Another pro is that there is free self serve green tea. The only con is that the place can get super crowded and people are really pushy. There isn't much order and it's a little chaotic. Definitely worth it though."
"Mediterranean burrito with onions was tasty, though the chicken pieces were rather large and a bit dry. Turkey burger pizza style was amazing it comes in a pita and is just the right size. Staff is super Friendly!! There is limited seating, so don't bring large crowds."
"Yeah this place is unique, fun, fast, cheap but it's not that good. I've experience a lot of Japanese curry and this is not on the top my list. The curry itself is just ok. Certainly a bit better than the box one that you get in supermarket, but not that flavorful. The katsu is mediocre. I've definitely had better ones. The katsu is just breaded pork cutlet and deep fried. Good katsu requires better meat, like pork tenderloin and better coating. Well to be fair, the restaurant is considerably cheap. But it's still not worth trying if you are just visiting new york. There are tons of better food out there."
"WOW, for $34 you can enough food (matador combo) to easily feed 4 people, NO JOKE! (we were a party of 3 and had plenty of leftovers). What Â the matador combo includes: Â mix of rice and beans (decent), tostones (a bit too dry for me, but my dining partners loved the traditional garlicky sauce... disclaimer: I much prefer maduros anyway), avocado salad (mostly avocados), a mix of hot dog pieces and fries (okay).... but the STAR of the evening was the succulent roasted chicken. O.M.G. Best roasted chicken in the city, hands down. This chicken is perfectly spiced and so juicy on the inside. The wait can be kind of long, so make sure to make RSVPs. We ordered an appetizer to share (shrimp/mango/sweet potato ceviche), which was a nice combo of flavors, but nothing beat this chicken. Oh, and put the green sauce on everything. It's amazing."
great selection! the drink menu was the size of a bible. pretty chill atmosphere... it's great to be able to talk and hear the people your there with.
"Brunch in NYC is an institution. People take it quite seriously, which is evident in the tremendous lines outside of just about every brunch spot in town. For the majority of NYC brunches I've experienced, it's simply a waiting game. You show up, put your name on the list, and wait. And wait. And wait some more. When you find a happening brunch spot that TAKES RESERVATIONS, you know you're onto something. With enough foresight, you will not have to wait to enjoy your eggs. And when you're this hungry, do you really want to wait for an hour? I certainly don't. Jane hosts a busy Sunday brunch which not only allows you to make reservations, but also offers a free cocktail with your brunch order! As long as you order off a specific list (of amazing options) you also have your choice of cocktails. Everything from a bloody Mary to a white peach bellini and a passion screwdriver, these are not boring brunch cocktails. They have as much appeal as the rest of the unique menu. A walnut raisin bread accompanies a simple white bread and strawberry butter as you sit and wait, watching drool-worthy plates pass. The strawberry butter was honestly too mild to really pick out the strawberry flavor, but we thought it was tasty nonetheless, and easily spreadable which makes all the difference in bread baskets. I had wanted to try both the Benedict Jane and the Benedict Johnny (the menu features 5 Benedicts, also including a traditional version, Florentine, and one with lobster), and asked the waiter if I could get one of each. Absolutely not, I was told. The chef wouldn't do it. I was honestly disappointed. I understand that during a busy brunch rush the chef doesn't want to be bothered with specific requests, but for what it's worth, most restaurants SHOULD make an effort to do the small things to please diners (I've had restaurants split appetizers onto multiple smaller plates for diners to have their own share instead of picking off of one plate, even without us asking, just to make things easier for US). You never know who will be writing about their meal on the world wide web for everyone and their mother to read. Fortunately, my amazing friend was totally cool with us each getting one of the two and then sharing. A solution to our problem! I am eternally grateful :) The Benedict Jane features a crab and crawfish cake base, wilted spinach, poached eggs and a tarragon Hollandaise. I thought it was scrumptious. The cake itself was tender and flavorful, a great compliment to a runny poached egg with some extra oomph from the spinach and mildly herbed Hollandaise. The Benedict Johnny started with a cornbread cake base topped with a maple chicken sausage patty, poached egg, and roasted tomato Hollandaise. We truly loved this variation as well, and really loved the sweet element of the cornbread cake with the sweet and slightly spiced sausage patty (I always put maple syrup on my sausage... I love sweet and savory with my breakfast sausage especially). We really got to experience the best of both worlds by going halfsies with our brunch picks. The fact that Jane offers so many Benedicts on their menu makes me really wish they had a mix and match option. But in lieu of that, I suggest going with a friend who doesn't mind sharing. We really enjoyed our selections, as well as the home fries laced with melted onions and red peppers that came on the side. Our cocktails were really enjoyable as well (and really, who doesn't love a cocktail with brunch?). Considering that an alcoholic beverage is included with your meal, the prices are especially fair (and don't forget, this is New York City... brunch can sometimes get seriously pricey depending on where you go). I LOVE that they take reservations too, and even though the chef couldn't make a simple substitution (even if I said pretty please), I would still happily add Jane to my NYC brunch hit list. And I know I'm not the only one :) Will definitely be returning..."
Definitely a nice place. Food is delicious and the half sangria and margarita is actually good. It is a little small and crowded and unfortunately you can not be seated without your party being there. You can't sit by the bar either and wait (at least that's what the hostess said) and then another hostess lady told me I could. A little confusion but aside that it was good. Try the tacos if you go!!! Definitely 2 thumbs up
"We loved our experience here. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because we are not big fans of cold oysters, but the happy hour deal is good value if you like beer and cold oysters! The server really made the experience for us, so friendly w good recommendations, but nonintrusive as well. The ambience is small with raw brick walls, feels very 'New York', can be dressy or casual. They have a small menu that changes seasonally, but the fish and summer squash that I had was delicious, and the calamari very good as well. My husband lived the Halibut. It feels like a healthy meal where the real flavour of the food is emphasized rather than relying on sauces and salt. Seafood that is very well done and good value too!"
I'm from Queens but was in the area with my fiance and we were looking for a place to eat. Checked with my Yelpers and this place was a must being that we're vegan and have yet to have had a vegan pizza that's been worth it. O. M. G. This. Pizza. Just go. We came in really hungry. And every pizza passing our table smelled so good. I have no idea which were vegan or not but they all looked amazing. When ours came I couldn't believe how good it was - just perfectly fire charred + thin crust. We ordered 1 pizza to share for the 2 of us but quickly ordered another cause it really wasn't enough. This place isn't on our way to anything but we know that wasn't the first and last visit. We'll be back for sure.
"Really long wait. Shits good, but When the waiter dropped trow and starting pissing all over the table, I was like WHOA! I mean, I like R.Kelly as much as anyone else, but Geez Louise! Speaking of R.Kelly, has anyone heard the new album? Its surprisingly pretty good...I mean it doesn't hold up to the soul godfathers of yesteryear. I mean he's no Isaac Hayes or Curtis Mayfield, but it's definitely worth a listen. But I digress. Food is good, and the wait is really long, but anywhere I can get good dumplings and a golden shower at the same time merits 4 stars in my book! Cheers!"
"This place is unique in a way that it can host a romantic dinner date, girls night out, or even a business meeting. But make sure you make reservations! Â Food was impeccable, sophisticated, subtle and well balanced. I knew I was in for a real treat for my meal when I was blown away by the amuse-bouche. Scallop: seared to perfection with amazingly sweet corn. Buccatini: like no pasta dish I've ever had, in a creamy but not heavy sauce with chunks of umber fresh dungeoness crab. The wine list is a good start for a new restaurant but could certainly use some bulking up."
"The pancakes were really tasty and came out hot and slightly crisp with a tender center. Four stars is only for the pancakes. The hand pulled noodles were a bit too salty for me (I'm not big on salt in general), but the texture of the noodles were excellent."
Our guests from Toronto absolutely enjoyed everything! Never fails! Perfect as always.
"Oh Danny Meyer, you culinary Yoda you. Danny Meyer, for you that don't know, is regarded as one of the most success restauranteurs in all of New York. Danny Meyer is the Chief Executive Officer at the Union Square Hospitality Group that owns Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Smoke, Shake Shack etc. The restaurant itself is very business-y, especially for lunch. It seems like a place you go for a meal to do business, not just to have a meal for shits and giggles. The decor is very clean and contemporary, it did have a European feel to it though. The food: Hen of the Woods Mushroom Pizza with Cotija Cheese. I am a big mushroom person, but I never had hen of the woods mushroom before but I really liked it. I thought the pie was nice, but it was oily for some reason. The cotija cheese offered a nice nuttiness that matched well with the earthiness of the mushroom. The dough was nice and thin and crisp. The pie was more like a white pie since there was no tomato sauce. yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦ Short Rib Beef Burger with Grilled Onions and Spicy Mayo on a Brioche Bun. Strictly on flavor, the flavors of the burger were great. The med burger came out med well, but the flavor was so intense that it did a good job covering up the overcooked patty. The grilled and fried onions offered a nice sweet and crunchy element and the spicy mayo offered a subtle kick to off set the sweetness of the onions. The brioche was a good choice in bread. yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦ Thrice-Fried Spice Fries- Fries cooked three times. I thought the fries were well seasoned and very nicely crunchy. Cumin was the predominant flavor I got from the fries, there were other spices but I only really remember the cumin. I love the texture of the fries, I just wish they were slightly hotter. The homemade ketchup and black pepper mayo was a nice addition. yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦"
"I come here few times a month and I have tried pretty much everything on the menu...everything is so good! My fav are pad Thai, spring roll, curry puff , mussels and of course Thai iced tea! Yummmm def worth the travel to come here."
"Definitely come here for brunch over dinner. I think the food is better and the atmosphere caters to a better brunch crowd. Extra Virgin is a cute, tucked away West Village spot with prime, outdoor sidewalk seating. The interior offers two different looks - turquoise walls and wooden paneling in one room and exposed red brick and mirrors in the other. Â The food and young crowd parallel each other creating a fun and ""that's exactly what I wanted"" kind of experience. Food: (for pictures of the food and scene go to my blog listed on my profile) 1. Pancakes are just as fluffy and delicious as they should be -no fancy flavored butter or overdone sauces. They offer a pancake as a side which is great if you dont want a whole short stack and also want to order eggs. 2. Eggs and omeletts are done right. Omelette of the day is always good and the frittata with basil and pesto is a nice treat! If you come here with only one other person it will be easier to get a table. They dont take reservations for brunch, but they do for dinner."
"I love this place! I always like food court system in Asian and happy to find find this one in downtown. The place looks so fancy, yet all the food are so reasonably priced. I tried the pork salad at 'Dos Toros' when I went there the first time. It was sooo yummy! I had to have it again when I went there again last Sunday. But I do want to try other food there as well. Everything looks good! It's kind of unbelievable to have good and cheap food in such nice environment. BTW, there was fancy car show when we went there last Sunday, made it even more pleasant experience."
"Knockout Ramen, great environment. The secret to a table (if you live or work in the neighborhood): drop by in the late morning or at lunch and request a table for that evening, enabling you to avoid a 2-hr wait."
"Even though it was after 8 PM on a Tuesday night, there was still a crowd of people standing outside Empanada Mama, waiting to get those famous empanadas. Although I had passed by before to pick up an empanada with a friend, this was my first time sitting down. Luckily for my friend and I, we had a short wait before getting in. Our first reaction was this place is really cute at night and the music is great! Our second reaction, after a period of time, was wow it's really chaotic and why do we still not have menus? After waiting for 10 minutes, we finally manage to flag down a waiter who, after another 5 minutes, finally brings us menus and water. We decided to share the Guacamole with Plantain Chips, which were AMAZING!!! The chips were perfectly cooked and the guac was fantastic! They also give you a lot and we didn't even get close to finishing. I also ordered the Viagra, Ham and Cheese, and Greek Spinach Pie empanadas. The Viagra was decent, but overpowered by the scallops. The Greek Spinach Pie was fine, nothing particularly special about it. The Ham and Cheese one was good. The cheese was beautifully melted inside the perfectly baked pastry crust and I quickly wished that I could trade in one of my other ones for more of the it. All in all, Empanada Mama is a decent place to grab empanadas, especially in Midtown. If you do come here, you absolutely need to get the guac and chips, which I'll definitely come get in take-out form soon!"
"My mom and I grabbed lunch here and we knew to come early for lunch time based on Yelp reviews. This place is popular and gets crowded fast! For empanadas, we ordered the spinach and cheese, brasil and desayuno colombiano. Also ordered a cubana arepa. We liked the desayuno colombiano the most! Super flavorful and moist meat. The empanadas arrived hot and toasty. The arepa was ok. The cubana was filled with beans, cheese and pernil. The pernil was a bit dry. I would come back and try all the other empanadas on the list."
"Best authentic tacos in Brooklyn! This has been my go-to for some cheap delicious tacos especially late night. Taco matamoros use to be my taco-craving spot many many yearss ago until they fell off the few recent years. Their tacos are loaded with onions, guac and cilantro on top, simple and just how it should be done while their meats are very flavorful!! My favorite is the tender beef... Which is clearly very tender! I just had the fried pork last night which was tasty as well but very dry... I think I prefer the al pastor more than the fried pork one. My boyfriend's favorite is the lengua (beef tongue)."
"I was truly skeptical when I walked into Big Wong, it's shabby and not to clean looking. But I put that aside and was happy I tried a few dishes that were really great. My favorite was the salted fish rice. It's like fried rice with small flakes of salted fish in it and was so flavorful. Drink plenty of water after though! We also had the duck, pork, congee and a noodle dish. It's a great place for sharing and alternative to dim sum on a weekend. Plus there are a lot of bakeries in the area to get a light dessert after the salt and grease deluge."
"I've come here twice. The first time was on an interview with E&Y (they took us out to lunch to make us feel at ease!) How nice!! Anyway, my second time was because I had a good experience the first time. The first time, I came for lunch, and remembered having calamari and a sandwich and a coke. It was absolutely delicious and being that its family style, the prices are really NOT so bad. I believe the calamari was somewhere near $30 or so, but the plate was ginormous. I was seated downstairs and the area was jammed packed on a weekday for lunch. Amazing business. So the second time, I came for dinner, and decided to take my family here. I treated everyone because it was Xmas and i used to work for a law firm, and recently got my bonus, haha. Spent my entire bonus on a party of 6. Â We had many many dishes family style. The best was the salmon, and the sausage (i believe it was antipasti section). It was so fulfilling and delicious. We also ordered the tbone steak, which wasnt as good as we thought especially with that $70 price tag. But hey, it fed 6 people. We also had mussels, which was the fastest dish to go because we LOVEEE mussels, done the italian way with wine and garlic! SOOO DELISH! also remembered having baked clams, which was a dish we could have done without. nothing spectacular. we also had a dish called chicken cortadina, which is cut up pieces of chicken and veggies. verrry fulfilling and enough to keep you full for a few days! Â my family loved this place, 1) becuase i paid, and 2)because the portions were humungous but still delicious! the ambiance is of course very touristy being that its in the middle of times sq, but every family kept to themselves, and i can tell everyone is having a great time at carmine's. althought it cost me an arm and a leg to pay for the dinner for my family, i would come here again, in a heartbeat, and treat them again! a big suggestion is to come with a reservation because it gets crazy crowded. so crowded that some opt for eating IN the waiting area! LOL. my mentality is that however many people are at the table, that's how many dishes you should order. BOY was i overestimating! i forgot that this is a family style dining option and 6 platters was just WAY TOO MUCH. we ended up bagging the leftovers home, and i kid you not......they gave us those silver trays (that you can find at the 99cent store) to bring home!!!! we had like 3 of those trays to bring home! of course it became a midnight snack/breakfast and lunch for the next day! lol i love carmine's!"
"If I could give more stars, I would. This place was excellent. Great food. Only wish portions were a little bigger on the biscuits and gravy appetizers. But they were top quality with awesome favors. I also really loved the decor and building. Exposed brick, nice tables. It seemed like a very historic building and it was awesome to eat there. Just wish there was a tad more light. It was very dark. Just from eating there once, I know without a doubt that everything on the menu would be nothing short of amazing. 10/10 definitely can't wait to go back again. Â You must try this place. Guaranteed."
overall a very good neighborhood restaurant but while some dishes were very good others were nothing to be excited about
"The Two Most Important Things You Need To Know About Lot 2. 1. They have one of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my life.* 2. They have a signed photo of Benny Agbayani in the back. I don't think there's a single other one-two (Hawaiian)** punch that could make me love a restaurant more. Other things Lot 2 has: -The perfect neighborhood restaurant vibe. Candle-lit and cozy, I would be ecstatic to have this place down the street. -Casual but attentive and knowledgable service. The best balance. -Excellent booze behind the bar, and quality cocktails made with said booze. I could drink the Father In Law all day long. And then I imagine I would be drunk enough to do stupid things that would lead to a divorce, and the subsequent loss of my own father in law. Isn't it ironic? -A short, but excellent menu. Salads (I love their Caesar), mains, appetizers; everything is carefully cooked and wonderfully flavorful. This is a good restaurant, and there are no bad choices here. But seriously, don't miss out on the burger. It is action-packed with big, beefy flavor, and comes on a toasted bun that I initially thought was too hard, but stands up perfectly to the serious amount of juice. The melted cheddar and the pickled onions are enough of an accompaniment, but I like spreading a bit of the mayo, ketchup and mustard provided onto the bun. Not too much though, because the Creekstone Farms beef is the star of the show, and it doesn't need much at all. Three perfect, crisp wedges of duck-fat fried potatoes round out the meal, and although I want more, I don't need anything at all after I'm done. Watch your step on the way out though, because I've basically fallen down into the street which wasn't embarrassing in the least. Â  _____________ *And I've eaten a LOT of burgers. **That was Benny's nickname. Hawaiian Punch. If you don't know who Benny is, by the way, then you can just go straight to hell."
"Awesome lobster in a nice, big space. Â Wish they served beer but otherwise a great experience."
"So I am not familiar with Japanese food. But I tried their Japanese breakfast as I stumbled onto an article about they indicating that they use local products and they don't use any fat or oil. I wasn't disappointed. You can definitely tell that they are using super high quality products, especially the fish. They are super passionate about what they are doing. The place is small and cozy. It is unpretentious. I am so glad I had this experience! Next I am going to try their ramen soup!"
"Been here three times and it's great every time. And no, it's not the Martini's talking- which by the way are uh-mazing. Cute spot to go for a date or with a bunch of friends. The peruvian corn, chicken empanadas, each and every paella, quinoa and ceviche (which changes all the time) are definitely worth trying. Someone every time I visit there is a birthday being celebrated. However, the desserts didn't impress me much. Only reason to be stingy on the last star. But I would go back. And back again."
Great if you can get a table. I've only been here when it is totally packed. THe pizza is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Try off peak hours to save yourself a lot of time and hassle!
Very pleasant and helpful staff. Great casual atmosphere and nice decor. There is something special about their margarita pizza. It is definitely in the sauce... an ingredient that makes it stand out from pizzas around town... even Luzzo's itself. It definitely is a standout pizza!! I highly recommend giving it a try if you haven't already!!
"So cheap and so good! There are no tables to sit, and the place is really tiny. Got there a little before twelve and the line was little. The fried pork dumplings are the best, tastier than the boiled! Got my order and went to a park some blocks away from there to devour the delicious dumplings."
"FYI, I ordered no fried chicken/chicken biscuit despite all the raving reviews. I came for brunch and had the pork hash & the fried caramel apple pie for dessert. My friend tried the sausage gravy biscuit & the coconut macaroon pie special. Everything was definitely comfort food, but nothing especially mind blowing. The pork hash was a tad too spicy and had bits of over cooked pork that was hard and chewy. The sausage gravy biscuit sounded like it wouldn't be filling at all, but it was very heavy and could have used an extra half of a biscuit to sop up the remaining gravy. The dessert pies were satisfactory - I did not get much caramel out of the fried apple pie. I did like that the pie crust for the coconut macaroon pie was lined with chocolate. I will probably be back to try the fried chicken!"
"Went here last Saturday night around 8:30 pm to grab a bite and was not disappointed in the least! We had about a 15 minute wait for two but were completely fine with that. We got a spot right in front of the kitchen area and loved watching our (and everyone else's) dishes being prepared right in front of us! We split the daikon (radish) salad, shrimp gyoza, and the Spicy Basic Ramen bowl and enjoyed Sapporos with the meal. The daikon salad was a perfect balance to the hot gyoza and ramen, considering it wasn't a chilly night. It was julienned radish piled high, drizzled with a peanutty, sesame-y sauce that is light enough to be a vinaigrette - delish. The shrimp gyoza has great flavor but was tricky to eat. The exterior of the gyoza was piping hot and quite malleable that it was impossible to pick it up with chopsticks without breaking the integrity of the gyoza, so you just have to make it a finger food. The shrimp inside comes complete with tails on so be sure to pinch those off. The spicy basic ramen was perfect to share after the apps. I am not a ramen connoisseur so I won't get into the NYC politics of Ippudo versus Minca versus Momofoku, but this tasted amazing and I will 100% be returning for all of the above dishes and more! Ended the meal with hot sake and went on our merry way!"
"This place adds nice mix to neighborhood with nice isreali falafel food here. Â Nice small venue w some seating but def gets busy during lunch time. Prices are bit on the high end, but i think well worth it. Â Salads and falafel here are fresh and delicious. Â I had the popeye, Â which is spinach & mushroom falafel pita sandwich and Â one of best i've had. Â Sauces & spreads are on point too. Overall place knows what they're doing"
"Small, cramped, pricey and impossible to get a table. Food is wonderful. Service excellent. Cannot wait to go back."
"Wawaweeewaaa! I was in the area and found this place on yelp, and am I glad I did!!! The staff was super nice and friendly! I went with the recommendations I read on yelp. Started off with a fish patty, which I really enjoyed. It was hot and flavorful, a perfect appetizer. Then I had the BBQ ""ribs"" over quinoa (which I wish I had a bucket of)... It was amazingly flavorful, with a little spice to it. The texture was really wonderful, felt like chewing real beef pieces. I got a small order of the ribs, and along with the patty, it made for quite a nice lunch. Finished off with the coconut vegan cake. Not overly sweet, and the coconut flavor plays well. Will definitely be back to try more things!!!!"
"French, cozy, intimate, romantic are a few words to describe La Sirene. It encapsulates all of this within a small space. If you're looking for a quality French restaurant for a special occasion, with family or a date, consider La Sirene. A French bistro located in a quiet part of the downtown Village area, it's the perfect venue for a special, intimate meal. Dimmed lights, candles, and music provide mood and ambiance. Come prepared though; it is BYO and cash only. Pretentious it may sound and appear, but La Sirene provides a balance of character when it comes to their food and service. It's refined but still keeps it casual and chill. You should expect waits. The space is small and retains a constant flow of customers in/out. My advice is to reserve, especially on certain weeknights/weekends. I was excited to try La Sirene for my wedding anniversary. My husband and I reserved a 7PM dinner for a Monday evening, and while it was quite early in the week, the restaurant was fully occupied. I appreciated the atmosphere. It was minimally decorative, and warm, dim lighting helped create an intimate mood. We brought our own bottle of red; no corkage fee applies. For appetizers, we ordered a half dozen roasted escargots in butter/garlic sauce, and the goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grape and 180 year old aged Swiss cheese. The escargot and the cheese tart were amazing, rich in flavors and succulent in every bite. Although they are the perfect portion for sharing, you will indeed fight over that last bite. For main course, I went with the Tournedos Rossini, a seared filet mignon with foie gras while my husband chose the signature seared hanger steak with garlic and parsley sauce. The portion sizes here are smaller than you'd expect; they are certainly French and petite. If you plan to order a steak, don't anticipate a big one. Our entrees were fantastic both in presentation and taste. I have to say the filet mignon was so most moist and soft that my knife just slid through it like butter. With your entrees, they provide you with an unlimited small platter of various vegetable purees; sweet potato, chayote, eggplant, and carrot. These sides were the perfect complement to our meal. We ended up ordering 2 helpings. To top all things off, we had some dessert, namely the Fondant Au Chocolat Noir, a dark lava chocolate cake with coconut sherbet. A glorious and rich dessert this was, and ever since, I have fallen in love with lava cakes. There were a few minor slip-ups. Our waiter accidentally brought us someone else's appetizer at the start, but luckily it was just a mix up. Our bread and vegetable tray came a little late into the meal. We were already 1/3 into our steak when the vegetables arrived. All in all though, La Sirene offers quite an experience, and it was a perfect/excellent choice for a wedding anniversary date. It's not an overstated venue, but it's classy enough for the most special of occasions. I would recommend to anyone, but just be prepared that if you're looking for a wine list and plan to use your flashy credit card, they only take cash and it is BYO."
"I've been to this pop-up countless times and every time it's been consistently solid. One of my favourite things served was the watermelon and feta salad. It's the perfect side to the slamming po' boys and chicken biscuit. I've also got an enormous food-crush on the staff. They have always been so friendly and accommodating to my huge take-out order to bring back to my buds at work down the block. If my budget wasn't so tight, I would come to Tchoup Shop every single weekend to taste the newest items on the menu. That's how good it is."
"Yes, majority of us came here for the fried chicken. Â And although Martha serves a tasty one with spicy honey, I am here to rave not about that but about the delicious brussels sprouts. Â Please, PLEASE, do yourself a huge favor and order this! Â They are served on a small skillet swimming in fish sauce, honey, with peanuts and pickled jalapeÃ±o. Â It was amazing! Another thing to note is how warm service is. Â Very chill, ready to help, available, but not overbearing. Â  A star off for excruciatingly loud music and inconsistencies with pancake. Â I saw three of these during brunch including the one we ordered and I must say, they came out in different shades w one super dark, luckily ours was in the middle. Â The batter consistency is definitely not pancake like, it was dense. Â Tastes good but dense. Dense batter or not, we'll be back!"
I don't know what all the hype is about. I came here for dinner one night with the hubby and was not pleased. You'd think they have an amazing menu because the wait was about 45 minutes for a Thursday night but it really was not so impressive. Husband had the chicken souvlaki sandwich which he said was really dry. I would have thought they'd have more souvlaki options on the menu (like a platter with sides versus a sandwich) and found the menu limited. I ordered the branzino which was very good but extremely oily. There was so much olive oil on that thing that I felt pretty disgusting at the end of it. We had a crappy table in the middle of the restaurant and kept getting pushed around by rushed waiters. Not the best experience. My husband went to use the bathroom and was grossed out by how yucky it was so better to hold it in!
"Flavor was good. Portions SMALL. 3 malai kofta balls for $14? The rice cream came as a TINY, PURE ice chunk surrounded by more ice. Was absolutely horrible. Once I waited for it to thawed I learned it was barely edible. Also said it came with berries. Nope. Fact that it was $6 was mind blowing. I probably wouldn't not order from here again."
"came here 3pm on sunday, waited Â about 15 minutes before taking a seat at the bar. cool atmosphere, nice bartender. the saltiness of the beef meatballs overpowered any of the meaty taste, so i did not like my meal very much. i ordered it with parmesan cream, which got kind of disgusting after a few spoonfuls, and sides of risotto and polenta. my favorite was the polenta -- light, fluffy, aromatic, and just a touch sweet. if i went back, i'd probably try the meatballs over salad with tomato sauce, which seems like a pretty good deal for $10 given the variety of vegetables."
"The food here is so incredibly good, today I woke up eagerly anticipating the long walk all the way from the Upper West Side (about 4 miles each way?) on this hot and sticky August afternoon just for the House Special Shrimp Roll... And then there's the Teo Chew Sate (which I recommend with flat noodles)... And then there's Country Style Duck with Mushrooms in Curry Sauce (which I recommend with egg noodles)... And then there's the Beef Belly Soup (which I recommend with flat noodles)... They do all of their meats AND their noodles AND their broths exceptionally well."
"No matter where you live you NEED to go to Jacob's Pickles. Â I've been a couple times and it never disappoints. Â Expect a long wait to get seated. Â People swarm the sidewalks every night. Â E's Bar (Stocked with fun boardgames and one hell of a Margarita Monday) opened next door... which on it's own is awesome but is also the perfect spot to grab a drink as you wait for your table to be ready. Â I've had the pickle sampler (You pick 4 variations of pickles to share at the table. Â Get the sweet and spicy carrots... you'll thank me) and the turkey leg dinner which left me with enough food for lunch the next day,"
I've been here for dinner and once for brunch. Its the perfect little spot on a quintessential block in the West Village. I don't quite remember dinner because it was long ago but the brunch was great! Its a pre-fixe menu and oh so reasonably priced! I had the omelette with spinach and goat cheese and it was very tasty. The home fries are out of this world! Add coffee and juice and the bill was still only $15. I would love to come here again..
"Vegetarians rightfully go nuts for this place. If you are one, and you like savory, saucy dishes you have to try. Really, really yummy."
"When giving a bad review, I sit and think and go through the experience again in my mind and see if there's any possible way that these problems could be improved so I can give a fair review and state what needs to be worked on. However, in the case of the restaurant Fish, there is no fixing these problems, its just bad! I came to Fish on a recommendation from a friend, I should have known right then and there because this girl don't know good food. My mind and tummy was craving some good seafood, so I decided to go with it and the reviews were pretty good also. I walked into Fish on a Saturday night and it was full. We had to leave our name and phone number and had about a good Â half hour wait. No problem, ""Caliente Cab"" was right around the corner and we went in for a few frozen drinks. The funny thing was, I was thinking maybe, we should skip Fish and just eat here instead since we already got drinks. But noooo, my friend who was with me said this is bad Mexican food, not authentic. Fine, he was right. Now looking back, I would eat that pre-packaged Mexican food any day over Fish!. We finished our drinks and walked back over. We got there just in time because we were seated as soon as we walked in. The seating was really tight. I was afraid that I would knock over our neighbors plates when squeezing by to get to my seat. Not good. Anyway, our waitress handed us our menu and told us some specials they had with a ridiculous attitude. I didn't care, I was just so hungry at this point! Reviewing the menu, they had some pretty good stuff and I was getting excited. I decided on the ""Soft Shell Crab"" and my dinner date ordered the ""Lobster Roll"" and a ""Clam Chowder Soup"". Might I add, my date had ordered his ""lobster roll"" first and was unsure if he wanted to get soup, when he decided that he did want it, the waitress was so irritated like as if we were bothering her!. A longggg time later, we were still waiting for our food and then the ""clam chowder"" soup finally comes and we were notified that the rest of the food will be out shortly. Since I was starving by now, I decided I'll have a little of the soup. Gross! How in the world can you mess up clam chowder soup?!!!! The texture was watery and flavorless. Horrible! The rest of the food finally came out and was looking good!. I couldn't wait to get down to business. My ""soft shell crab"" came with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. The ""Lobster roll"" came with a side of fries. As I started to dig into the crab first, I noticed the bottom was super oily and soggy. Gross. And I'm pretty sure my blood pressure sky rocketed when I began to eat that crab. It was like eating salt cubes. Not just the crab but everything on that plate! It was disgusting! Now the ""lobster roll"" was complete crap! Nasty bread! Nasty dry lobster! The worst!. Just to justify how horrible this experience was, we started chatting up the the couple next to us, who was also having a bad dining experience. First they sent out the wrong dish to them, then when they got the order right they told them they were out it. The husbands food was also salty and not to his liking. And as for the wife, she was pretty ticked off. They also stated they would not be back! Hmm, now I know its not just us then. Bad food! Bad waitress! I will not be back here. Oh, and the food is way overpriced."
"Great on a warm night, they have some tables outside and it's very open air if you're inside. The prices are pretty ridiculous, as in ridiculously low! I had the gnocchi, one of my Italian test dishes (I like to order it at all unfamiliar Italian places) and they passed with flying colors. Service was decent, but we ordered a bottle of wine that never found its way over... that was a bummer. I'd love to try a few more things, so think it's likely I will return..."
"Food is fresh and the plethora of colombian empanada options are dizzying. Â  The seafood and chicken ones are stand outs, and the hot and spicy was a bit too sour and hot for my liking. Â Overall there a number of other good options including the soups, and the salads. Try to come early for lunch or outside rush hour as the service and kitchen grinds to a halt when slammed with too many orders."
"The first time I went here was 2 years ago for Valentine's Day. Â My boyfriend and I sat in the back corner table and ordered the special appetizer of the night: lobster perogies in a light buttery sauce...INCREDIBLE! Rustic decor with fire burning lanterns hung from the ceiling. Great service, medium size seating area that feels intimate without being claustrophobic. Â This place is off the beaten path and definitely not touristy, so you can expect to be dining alongside real New Yorkers, which I appreciate. Boyfriend loved the fried green beans with spicy mustard dipping sauce and we are both fans of their chicken."
"Love, love, love, love. Came here on a Friday night and was expecting to wait -- nope. Despite being a cozy place, there was only a five minute wait for two. To start, they've got a great wine and beer list with a variety of price points (I got the tasty rosÃ© for only $6). And the food... sweet good lord. Come hungry. The portions aren't big by any stretch of the imagination, but SO rich. I had the Austrian meatballs which totally knocked my socks off. The meat was tender and juicy, and the carrots served on top were the sweetest, most flavorful carrots I think I've ever had. I heard great things about the desserts from other patrons... will be returning!"
"The food here is really authentic. The people are very friendly as well. The space is clean and classy looking with marble tables and bookshelves filled with decorative volumes of bargain basement books. I ordered one of the pintxos and an omelette. Both were very tasty. I washed it down with a bottle of Moritz, which was perfectly refreshing for a hot summer day. Unfortunate that this place is only open during the day. I would love to come here in the evenings and have a drink and some bites with a friend. If you're looking for something from Spain that is hard to find, chances are that they carry it here. They also opened a wine shop next door that sells Spanish wines. I bought a bottle on advice of the shopkeeper. It was one of the most drinkable Riojas I've ever had. This is a one of a kind place and a one stop shop for all things related to Spanish food and drink."
"The broth is flavorful and rich. The noodles are cooked perfectly. The charshu has slightly fattier cuts than what I prefer, but it was seasoned well. ...And yes, I do like corn with my ramen. Try not to hit it when you think other people will go, because you will end up waiting in a very small cramped area staring at some hipster reading a book after he finished his meal 20 minutes ago (it happens). Compared to those other ramen places? It stands on its own. Worth a try."
"Every time I come here, I'm reminded why I love the simple, clean flavors of Japanese food so much. I've tried many of the noodle dishes, both cold and hot, usually with the soba. I would recommend trying the starter dishes...just amazing, clean flavors that I miss eating a largely Western diet even in NY. The eggplant and the sweet potatoes are two of my favorites. I usually go for the no frills cold or hot soba with the mushrooms and radish. For a more hearty and intensely flavored dish, the duck is delicious!"
"Nestled in a tiny shop with barely enough walking room behind and in front of the counter, The Islands serves delicious home-cooked food, and life seems to move at a slower pace. I ordered a large jerk chicken with the standard rice + beans and veggies and was super satisfied. The chicken was tender and appropriately spiced - the rice&beans were a bit bland but served to sop up the sauce from the chicken. It took a while for our food to be prepared - so if you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you order ahead of time. However the service, albeit slow, felt like my mom was making food for us, and that's something special."
"Yummy food and small, intimate, place. Flavors and quality of food are really good."
"Situated inside the Neue Galerie; the perfect place to have a quiet lunch. Beautifully decorated room, much like some of the cafes in Berlin. Great dessert options. The liverwurst spread with onion confit, pistachio chocolate cake, fruit crumble, elderberry syrup with sparkling water, and coffees were all done well."
"- Brussels sprouts, a MUST. Â It's sweet (golden raisins), it's salty, has some yogurt mixed in, toasted walnuts, and the Brussels sprouts are perfectly roasted. Don't be turned off by this odd mix of things, it will not disappoint. Â I get this every tim"
"To be totally honest, I wouldn't eat here again. The value is good for the money, and the service is efficient and friendly. But you what, the pizza ain't nothing special. I had the infamous artichoke and the white sauce just didn't do anything for me. Would it hep I I said it was too creamy? I didn't taste any artichoke goodness. Nice vibes there though, convenent location. I would say Â glad I tried it, but no, I wouldn't take anyone else there."
"Grape and Grain was a great place for dinner. The prices are reasonable, the food is simple and pretty good, and the staff is friendly. My friend and I were able to sample a few wines and cheeses before we settled on our choices. In addition to cheese and wine, we tried the Deluxe Pretzel, which was topped with pumpkin seeds served with jalapeÃ±o-dill pickles & artisanal cheddar.I'm a huge fan of soft-pretzels so I was a fan of this started. We also split the Margherita pizza. Not the best I've had but tasted just fine. Perhaps the dough was lacking salt and next time, I may opt for a different type. Ambiance is perfect for a date or even for a group of friends to get together. The bottles of wine are also very reasonably priced."
"Finally got in at Penelope. My friend and I both got sandwiches and they were very good, but not as good as the line outside the restaurant would have you believe. Food was decent, but I feel like they're more focused on their image than they are their meals. The service was a bit slow and it was FREEZING inside there. I left with numb toes. If you're in the mood for traditional American food in Murray Hill, this place is worth it - so long as you don't have to wait too long."
"My friend and I ordered Chicken & Waffles and the Mac Attack to share. I was expecting the food to be amazing. Unfortunately, Cafeteria is just another ""hip"" restaurant that sells overpriced food. The waffles had a kick to it and the chicken was juicy but I can definitely find better Chicken & Waffles for less than $20. The portions are large but I still think it's overpriced. The Mac Attack wasn't great either- all three flavors tasted similar. I'd rather eat Velveeta ahaha I will not be returning. Cafeteria is overly hyped up and the food here is just not worth it for me."
Awesome wines and cool bartenders. Too bad they weren't serving food until 5 on a Saturday after their morning brunch. We will be back for dinner.
"I think this place is has the best dumplings in NYC, apart from Joe's Shanghai that is. For the price it's a crazy steal.. Their noodles are just ok, a bit greasy.. If they can make a better broth, they'd really be putting those hand-drawn noodles to good use. I had a bowl with beef once but only ate half of it because I felt like the grease was going to pour out my ears. Just get the dumplings, nothing else, frozen is good too if you want to take em home"
"This place is an Italian food lovers dream and we really loved going here before all the hype. It has become so full of people recently that it's painful to navigate. Still, if you can get in before the rush or on a weekday, it's a fun experience."
"Our first stop on our self-guided bar hopping tour in lower Manhattan found us at Fraunces Tavern. Â We took a cab to Stone Street, but we ended up on the wrong side... so as we walked around the block, we discovered this tavern that touted they have their own beer. Â Since we'd been searching for great beer in the city for two days now, I *had* to go see what this was all about. Â Little did I know we found a hidden gem! Â (Apparently not so hidden- Fraunces Tavern is very well known). How much more authentic can you get than all 4 bartenders from Ireland?! And the nice gentleman seated next to me was also from Ireland (Hey Sean!). I felt like I just crossed the big pond! Â They had excellent live music on Sunday at about 6pm, and they have $6-8 20oz pours of their 5 taps all brewed at Porterhouse Brewing Company in Dublin. They had 4 stouts- and they were all superb! Â I enjoyed the dry stout the most, but I also enjoyed a Wrassler Stout from the dear Irishman seated next to me.. what a joy in NYC! We decided to share the bacon cheeseburger sliders cooked as rare as you could get. Â They did just that- often sliders are overcooked, but these were perfect. Â Their house-made chips were delightful too. Â The food was a bit pricey ($13 for sliders) but they were worth it. I'm not sure why this place gets bad reviews, because it was one of my favorites in the city... I'll certainly stop back by here next time I'm in historic downtown NYC."
"After my first meal at Luluc I realized that I am not a lover of pancakes though I thought I was in the past. Â The pancakes are solid, don' t get me wrong. Â I loved the softness of the middle and the buttery crispiness of the outside but I felt like they were way too dense but still overall pretty tasty. Â The second time I came here I opted for a calamari ""salad"" which was really some fried calamari on a bed of lettuce and a side of coleslaw. Â The service is nice and fast enough. Â I would Â come back but I'm not in any kind of rush."
"I am so freaking awkward on the phone. Â Here's the tail-end of my conversation as I make a last-minute reservation for this place. Alta Phone Guy: So do you want to check to make sure that 8 will work? Jordan J: Sure, I'll talk to my brother and call you right back. --hangs up-- --Confirms time with brother. Â 30 seconds pass. Â Jordan J naively imagines Alta Phone Guy twiddling his thumbs and waiting in anticipation for a return call-- Jordan J: --calls back-- Alta Phone Guy: Alta. Jordan J: Hey, it's me again. Alta Phone Guy: Who's me? Jordan J: .....the guy you were just talking to? Â About the reservation at 8? Alta Phone Guy: I talk to a lot of people. Â I get a call about every 3 seconds. --Continues on about why it was silly of Jordan J to assume he'd know it was him on the phone-- Jordan J: But.....I thought you'd recognize my voice......and I said I was just going to be quick..... --feels shame-- Anyhoo, we got the table, and we sauntered in a few minutes early and were seated immediately. Â The restaurant itself is loud, but pretty gorgeous - from the fact that it's pretty much unmarked on the outside to the decor on the inside, I thought it managed to be pretty classy while also sort of giving you the impression that you're about to get a home-cooked meal. Â Or alternately, as my brother put it, it looks like the entry space you'd walk through while waiting on line for a Pirates of the Caribbean ride. We were told that 2-3 dishes per person would be ideal, and we wound up going with 8 total for the 3 of us. Â In hindsight I probably would have opted for a couple more (or at least some dessert afterwards), but this was a reasonable amount that left us full but not uncomfortably so. Â What did we get, you ask? Â Well, if you must know: Bacon-Wrapped Dates and Olives: Â Not awful, but not great. Â The bacon was nice and crispy, but there wasn't as much of a rich, strong date flavor. Â The bacon-wrapped olive was interesting but didn't totally work for me. Â I'm a huge fan of dates, but I'd probably pass on this one if I came back. Crostini of House Cured Duck Breast: Â This was pretty solid, but not particularly memorable. Â It came with 3 crostini, which were good (and very crunchy!), and I really liked the sundried tomato spread that these things came with. Carpaccio of Beef: Â One of my favorites of the night. Â This shit was melt in your mouth soft, and I loved the horseradish creme fraiche foam - delicious flavor to go with the beef, but still light enough that it didn't make the dish heavy at all. Tunisian Pastry: Great flaky pastry shell, though the filling itself didn't stand out. Â The delicious lebne did though! Mussels: Arguably the highlight of the meal, and the best deal too. Â We got a TON of mussels, and they were fantastic. Â Also, the broth makes for a glorious dipping sauce. Avocado Relleno: Very good crabmeat/shrimp filling, and I really like the avocado wrapping; it was almost like some sort of overstuffed avocado roll. Pulled Pork Empanadas: How can you go wrong with pulled pork inside a fried shell? Â These were good, but seem less appealing when you realize that you can get 2 bigger, better empanadas at Empanada Mama for quite a bit less. Braised Short Rib of Beef: This was pretty freakin delicious. Â Great, tender meat - this was the one true mouth-watering dish of the bunch. So the food was good, but it wasn't enough to blow me away. Â The service wasn't outstanding either - pretty much everyone we interacted with seemed like they were slightly annoyed with life, and they weren't forthcomingly helpful or enthusiastic about the food here. Â This didn't really take away from the experience, but with a place that looks as nice as Alta does, I would have expected the service to be a notch or two up from where it was. Â Also, things moved really fast - we were out of here in less than an hour. On the whole, Alta managed to offer up some good food, and I'd be willing to give them another try - they've got a sizable menu and I'm sure there are some more winners in there. Â But there are definitely better options out there for tapas, especially considering the price. Also, make sure you remember - cash or Amex only!"
"This place may be in a bit of a ""rough"" neighborhood but it was worth the trip. Â The wifey and i ate dinner here and the food was really good...and we're indian so we know good indian food. Â Small restaurant but the customer service is extremely friendly and accommodating. The next time someone refers to an indian as a ""gandhi"" they can be proud thanks to this fine establishment."
This place is incredibly difficult to find at first. Â When you first try to find it you feel like you are following a path to a werewolf den. Â Kind of a weird place to find but it is worth it. I was going to list all the dishes we had but then I remembered I have no clue what we ordered. Â We did some sushi but really focused on the tapas like sharing of the small plates. Â We had about 5 to 6 dishes between the two of us and were very happy. Â Some of the dishes were aggressive in terms of taste profiles but it felt very authentic. Â I would definitely go back but you need to take someone there that has an open pallet and is a bit adventurous.
"About $10 per dish the size of a tea cup saucer. But so delish. Damn, my wallet and my taste buds were at war. My group of friends and I (a party of 5) stopped by around 8:30pm on a Friday night and, of course, the little restaurant was packed. At most, you can probably be amongst 25 other diners or so. It is so cramped inside that if you were to spill your sangria, it would spill onto an unsuspecting neighbor easily. True story. As you try to squeeze into your seat, you might actually sit on someone else already seated. True story. The hostess was very nice and took down my cell and called us when they had made a table for us, which took 15 minutes tops. And the dishes started coming out in 5 minutes tops! Seared duck breast (a special): Two of my friends raved about how perfect it was. Didn't find it amazing besides the price (~$14) for 3 slivers of duck. Lamb chops (a special): I did not try this but a friend said it was too gamey for her. Creamed spinach: The best I have ever had! It came out hot on a little ceramic plate and it was so cheesy! Loved it! It tasted divine on bread. Some marinated octopus dish: The waitress recommended this over the normal octopus salad they had on the menu. The octopus was really tender and soft. It was very good. Albodigas: I found them dry. The balls had diameters of quarters. Empanadas de pollo: The dough was very light and flaky. Patatas bravas: My friends said the allioli was crack but I didn't find the dish as good as they thought it was. The potatoes are cut into the cubes and drizzles lightly with the sauce. Chipirones fritos: Solid calamari. Red pear sangria: Tasted like pure juice, if you're down with that. The pear slices in it was very fresh and sweet. We started picking them out of glasses. All of this cost us ~175, gratuity included. It was a very light meal but left us all pretty satisfied."
Liked the chicken sandwich a lot but thought the sides were kind of run of the mill. If you go there try the jalapeÃ±o mashed potatoes they are pretty good. All in all it's a good chicken sandwich at a park slope price.
"I really enjoy Tabare as it seems a bit off the beaten path as far as Williamsburg establishments are concerned and I like taking friends here because it makes me seem knowledgable of some sort of slightly less-discovered Williamsburg food scene. It's a small space, and can be a bit noisy with live music, but the food will definitely keep you coming back. The food focus is a latin-american sort of fusion, and very well done in my opinion. The empanadas were very good (I had a special empanada) and ordered the fish of the day and have enjoyed everything I've tasted each time."
"Beyond epic! This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the city. If you don't go for anything else, go for the Dan Dan Noodles. Incredible!"
"Been here for lunch a few times due to business, but just can't seem to like it compared to other places nearby. The decor is interesting with the large chandelier, that I wished would be decorated in my home, and mirrors all over the roof. Palates are presented in very large plates, which makes the food look a tad bit small portioned, but in the end, your stomach is full. Prices are very reasonable. A selection of one free appetizer is definitely a plus. Service was a little slow, but nothing to be worried about. The staffs are very attentive and constantly on the watch for empty cups and plates. A good sign. I know that happy hour and night time, this place gets packed. Maybe one of these days, I would like to experience the night hours."
"Love this bar. Only thing I dislike is that you never know when it will be full or empty.. The backyard is nice in the warmer weather. It's a bit more upscale of a bar, they actually take their cocktails somewhat seriously, so if you want to drink vodka crans, seabreezes, and pound PBR's all night you might as well skip it. (They have none of those - no fruit juice, and their beers are all actually good beer.) Why am I seeing a photo of buttermilk fried chicken???!! I want that!! Â I thought their menu only had a patty melt, a grilled cheese, chicken strips and like, olives or something... Â Anyway, the patty melt is great if you are hungry."
"This place was AMAZING! This is my favorite place to date. Be ready to intoxicated by the fragrant smell of fresh REAL apples which decorates the wall when you first walk into the restaurant. What a clever idea to create a modern rustic ambience for patrons of the restaurant! My fiance and I came here for lunch and ordered all I listed below from the tasting menu (scroll all the way down). My fiance is not a fan of seafood but he loved everything we got with the exception of the big eye tuna where the texture was too ""FISH"" for him. So hey, if you are not a seafood fan, try the high quality fancy seafood here and you will become a fan! My personal favorites were Porcini Flan, Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon, and the Kobe Style Beef Cheeks. We got the Chicken on recommendation as a personal favorite of our server. While it was cooked to perfection, I did not like the flavor. It tasted a little too ""green"" for me. All the desserts were to die for. Just when we thought we were done with our meal, we were brought a slew of petit fours. Chocolates, macarons, etc! Overall the food was so elegant, light, and the flavors perfect leaving you wanting for more and more! I was so sad when our last course came out! Not one dish was over sauced or over prepared. The servers were extremely attentive. After each course, our plates and silverware were immediately whisked away and we were brought our next course. We were also given fresh slices of bread baked in house, Â with sexy ingredients such as olives, figs, apricot, currants, pistachio, etc. You get to choose which and how many slices you want. Try them all if you'd like! They slice the bread in front of you :) I highly recommend taking your sweetheart here and ask for a table by the back. I loved where we sat. The decor was vintage chic with a library of vintage books. Our table had a nice vase with David Austen Garden Roses (which is one of my favorite flowers!) I just loved the romantic ambiance of this place! Big Eye Tuna Green Apple, Bergamot, Osetra Caviar Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon Salmon Trout Roe, White Truffle Honey Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms Sweet Garlic, Special Spices, Grilled Toro, Black Truffle Dressing Porcini Flan Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken Baked ""En Cocotte"" with Alfalfa and Clover Hay Blue Kale, Roasted Garlic Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks Blue Kale Gnocchi Chilled Rhubarb Soup Santa Barbara Organic Strawberries, Buckwheat Gelato Kingston, NY White Peach Soup Amaretto Ice Cream, Crystallized Honey Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ© White Coffee Cloud, White Chocolate Ice Cream, Chocolate Mousse Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear Valrhona Chocolate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce Lemon Verbena and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream"
"Sat at the bar on a Tuesday night. Will was the bar man (sommelier)... First he recommended a superb Riesling (I said I wanted dry and yet lots of fruit - he nailed it). Then it was red..an unbelievable Finger Lakes Pinot Noir? Eh? Yet delicious! Then Will allowed us to try two other wines. On top of that, the chicken liver pate was (thank goodness) without cream and the lamb sausages were yummy. The funky meatballs were super as well (what was that spice?). And the stinky cheese with a suitable Riesling completed a fun and super-informed meal, thank you Will!"
"Not sure how good ramen is suppose to be so I give them 5 star instead of 4. After reading many reviews on long wait times, I really tried to figure best time to come here. Â Luckily on a wkdy, I had nothing doing so I decided to go for lunch. I thought I would get there minutes after opening so there is no way there will be a line/wait. Well I was right . We were seated right away. Â The place is not huge but it's not tiny. Â I can see how after a few are seated the rest would just have to wait. Again being early birds we had the lunch crowd stroll in. .. Place wasn't too loud. I ordered lunch set (salad, rice bowl, soup) and also pork belly. pork belly was sooooo good. If they had take home, Â I would get some to go. I think I got the same soup most already ordered on yelp.. ..A.modern. Meal also came with rice bowl. I got the one with grilled eel, my date got the chicken which was also quite tasty. By the end, we were sooo stuffed and we knew they don't allow take out so that was a shame. After meal we were served with tea. No space for dessert. Everything was delicious. Â Now if I had waited 2hrs to be sested and served, my taste buds may not be so generous...but that is in general. I would come back but pay attention to time of day as I would not want to wait more than 15mins to be sested."
"My husband and I came her for brunch after we were quoted ""at least"" a 2 hour wait at Penelope. Â What is up with New Yorkers waiting hours for brunch? Â It's bizarre to me. Â Anyway, there aren't a lot of brunch options in the neighborhood but my husband had been here for burgers and said it was good and we saw they have a brunch menu so we decided to check it out. Â  The brunch menu is a little pricey (most entrees $12-$15) but the entrees come with a lot of food. Â All breakfasts are served with sweet potato wedges, fruit cup, toast, coffee or tea and juice. Â My husband had the Hungry Cub ($12) which is 2 eggs and bacon or sausage (turkey bacon is an option) in addition to all the aforementioned stuff. Â  I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the plain waffle ($9) off the kids menu and they gave me all the sides too. Â  I wish their menu had more a la carte choices or smaller combinations. Â What I really wanted was a waffle and a fried egg but I didn't want to pay $15 for the Hungry Bear when I didn't want bacon and all the extra sides. The food was decent and the portions were big. Â The waffle wasn't the best I've had but it was tasty. Â I'm not sure I'd go back for brunch because of the limited menu but I definitely want to check out their burgers. Â Service was really friendly and prompt."
"I'm prone to judging a restaurant by its vegetables. There is something to be said for a place that can transform a humble carrot into a masterpiece of a dish. I mean, it's a carrot, right? Oh no, it's a roasted rainbow carrot topped with nutty and fresh carrot top pesto. Roasting releases natural sugars and you end up with some of the sweetest and best carrots you've ever had. You can get the roasted carrots and either 2 or 4 more innovative vegetable sides for a great price. I went with the server's suggestion and tried the sweet potato and kale au gratin and sauteed pea shoots. While cheesy gratins are warm and comforting, the pea shoots were superior. It's easy to screw up a pea shoot by over cooking or over seasoning. They are delicate and crispy tendrils with a freshness you don't want to ruin. The Marshal cooked them perfectly so that they retained their natural flavor and crunch with a touch of oil and seasoning. My delightful evening at the Marshal was made complete by sipping the Armadillo's Whistle with rye, vermouth, and bitters. The service was fantastic, the drink was bold and bitter, and of course, the food was right on."
"Got 2 Pollo Asado guaco tacos and a small water. At $11.50 it wasn't by any means a reasonable price point, but Baby Jesus strike me down if they weren't the best tacos I've ever had. Everything that was supposed to be warm or cool respected its proper temperatures which is HUGE. It can easily kill the blend if it's just a pile of warm mush. I didn't leave stuffed or hungry so all the better to come back and make some delicious and regrettable decisions."
"Went here for lunch on a Wednesday after high recommendation from a friend. Â I got the pulled chicken entree. Â The food was pretty good. Â The chicken and tomato sauce was delicious and not dry. Â It came with a small cupsize scoop of rice & Â the plantains were excellent. Â The gripe I have about Cafecito is the price. Â The entree was $18 for lunch. Â I thought it was a bit overpriced. Â Overall, its a nice place to take a date for dinner, but not a lunch spot."
"Although these dumplings do not compare to dumplings in the San Gabriel Valley, I can definitely appreciate the price tag! // LOCATION // LES/Chinatown Â  // SERVICE // Gruff and curt, as expected for Chinatown. You order at the counter and then seat yourself. When your number is called, pick up your order (served on styrofoam!), and stuff your face. Bus your own trays. Orders take a while to come out. // FOOD // Â  Â  + Chive and pork potstickers: Oily, crispy, and delish Â  Â  + Cabbage and pork dumplings: The skin is on the thicker side, but the filling is very flavorful and juicy Our total was $4.50! You would be hard-pressed to find dinner in NYC for cheaper than that."
"One of my favorite ramen spots in Nyc. Great chicken broth with great flavor. May have to wait a bit , but always glad I did. Highly recommend!"
"Really great place for tea and desserts! Tends to be crowded but, if you're adventurous, I'd recommend going for some awesome sweets and yummy tea. The staff is very polite. They might rush you a bit but stand your ground and you'll be in for a pleasant time!"
"Reading the other Yelp reviews may have spoiled my first impression of this place--I admit I had my expectations a *wee* bit high coming in for brunch one weekend morning. I, however, was not disappointed even if not completely blown away and would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking to dabble in a Southern styled brunch for the morning. This is a very popular spot located in Williamsburg not far from public transportation and while I did not have to experience a wait, many of the parties coming in did however end up waiting for a good 15-20 minutes. No reservations, so plan your trip wisely and my first recommendation would be to arrive as early as you can! Restaurant is a little tight, but they do have a back dining area and it can hold a decent number of parties. There's larger and smaller sections in the restaurant. I also have to note that I loved the music they were playing here... Onto the important stuff, Service was very rush and go given the volume and demand from the restaurant, but they were friendly and I had no issues with them. There was a quip with the credit machine at the end of my visit and we had to wait a good 10 minutes additional for the cheque, but they apologized and let us know timely. Food is really great. I highly recommend the chicken biscuit--moreso than any of the other options on the menu (given I haven't tried everything). You'll get your hands a little messy, but it's damn tasty and worth a try. I also sampled the fried chicken & waffles, biscuits, the chocolate cake donut and the sweet tea. I found all of the options pretty tasty. I wasn't blown away by the fried chicken (little dry, tasted run of the mill) and definitely have had better, but the biscuits were scrumptious and the chocolate cake donut was very filling! Sweet tea was a smidge bland--when I think sweet tea, I want it as sweet as sweet can be. Waffles were mega tasty and I loved 'em. So, tl;dr version of the food-- waffles and chicken biscuit were a total hit in my book. Get those when you come here. Try out the donuts too. I didn't get to try the pies--will come back and definitely add my two cents on those also!"
"Why Come Here? Cute back garden/fireplace area, some excellent cocktails, eat tapas with the MePa crowd Salinas has received a lot of hype as a hot new tapas spot, so we were excited to finally check it out one Friday night. The space is cool, especially the backroom which comes complete with fireplace and retractable roof. It's everything you'd expect from a Meatpacking District restaurant in that regard. Unfortunately, it's also everything you'd expect in terms of the crowd, service and food. We started off by waiting for 45 minutes despite having a reservation. This did give us a chance to enjoy some excellent cocktails, however it would have been nice to see them comped given the wait. Strike one. Our table was in the back area, which does feature a cozy fireplace and a retractable roof that would be enjoyable on a summer's day. However, it wasn't summer. It was January. And they decided to open the roof to ""cool things down."" It was very unpleasant especially since we were sitting under the opened part. It took repeated requests from my girlfriend and other patrons before they finally closed it back up. Even excluding that, the service was inattentive at best. Strike 2. Now onto the food, or Strike 3 as I call it. Not terrible, but certainly not worth the praise. Here's what we ordered: Manzana de la Mancha (cachaca, cider, lemon & elderflower liquor) - This cocktail was the highlight of the evening. Sweet, sour and bitter, it's definitely worth it if your friends drag you here. Katherine - who ordered it - gave it 4 stars. Coles y Color (Fried Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower)- It's funny that brussels sprouts is the first ingredient here because it's mostly cauliflower with a couple sprouts. If that's what you're up for, there are some interesting enough flavors. Crujientes Mahones - A lot of critics talked this one up so I felt we had to give it a try. You basically get a big, hollow piece of bread with cheese and honey on top. The pieces with the cheese are very good, but it's kind of hard to eat as the bread just breaks apart when you try to cut it. And the pieces without cheese are just bread crust. Pulpo (poached octopus) - Not sure what happened here as it's another critically acclaimed dish. However, the octopus was mushy and bland. The only flavors that came through were potato and a little bit of the paprika. We didn't finish it. Rosejat Rapida ** - This is the signature dish at Salinas and it is actually quite good, although a little heavy on the salt. The saffron flavors really come through, but the different textures keep it interesting."
"Best pizza I ever had. A must try, but be prepared to wait a long line."
"Love Beyoglu. Everything is delicious - from the hummus to the salads to the meats. Not one unhappy camper here ever. They have a lovely outdoor section that wraps around the corner, a downstairs, and a super sexy upstairs. Perfect place to reserve a larger table upstairs and share everything. Another plus, their baklava is the best I have had in my life! And their rice pudding and almond pudding were also amazing!"
Cozy little ramen joint. If you like spicy then try the Tonkotsu spicy ramen and make sure to get it with the wavy noodles. Cash only so remember to bring cash!
Hands down best pork buns I ever had! Â This was the only thing I ordered here and it was that great!
"The food and the employees that I experienced here are worth 5 stars, but I had to take one off for prolonged waiting times for our food. I think that they have to rethink their kitchen so they can more effectively handle a full capacity crowd (which they very often have). The employess: Â Very friendly and professional The food: Â Delicious across the board. Â The mac and cheese is creamy and delicious.The buttermilk fried chicken is tender, juicy, super tasty. Fish tacos excellent. The portions are large (alas, we could not fit it dessert). Â Definitely, in my opinion, worth a visit. Â We will definitely be back. Oh, Wait! I forgot tomention the home made pickles! Â They are dills are delicious, with a unique sweetness to them. Â Good Good."
"This place is a little small. The soup dumplings were okay but John's Shanghai soup dumplings are better, probably because they're greasier and fattier. The place is kind of small and was also crowded. I don't know. I feel like this place is pretty forgettable compared to other restaurants."
"While fancy brunch spots in the neighborhood have hour long waits to pay top dollar I go to this amazing diner. The food is delish and way cheap. $5.10 for 2 eggs, hash-browns, corned-beef hash, toast, and coffee or tea! The staff is friendly and on top of their game. Your coffee never runs out and you will be memorized by the cook's memory. Make sure you tip your waitstaff accordingly, not based on your $5 meal!"
"This is where you need to go on a cold day --it hits the spot. The food quality here is good but it is still a bit pricey, you'll end up paying $35 per person. The atmosphere is good if you like eating in dim lighting & if you're into electronic music. All in all, it is still my to-go to hotpot spot because of the quality. Oh yeah, get the cuttlefish paste --its gooooood!"
"In my typical cabbie style, I was only able to do a slice on the go, so can't say much for the service. I had the veggie slice that was packed with veggies so that I wondered how they were able to stop everything from tumbling down. Broccoli, some veggie that looks like banana skin, tomatoes and stuff. It was good but small around the edges and not entirely filling. What blew me away most though was that they had a strawberry and marshmallow pizza that looked pretty creative and I just might stop by just to try that."
"There are two ways to approach a meal at Thanh Da, either trying to secure a table and taking a look at their regular menu, or grabbing a bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ for takeout. Of the latter, every sandwich is priced at $3.75 which seems to be the going rate for Sunset Park these days. I started with the #1 sandwich, the normal bÃ¡nh mÃ¬, just to sample how the place handled making them. I am not so impressed by their wrapper, just a boring baguette that was not fluffy and only toasted a bit. Inside the content was more promising, but was not stuffed full of vegetables and pickled items as much as I would prefer. The meats were good, and the grilled pork inside was especially tasty, sweetened to perfection. The sandwich is served very warm and fresh, and should be eaten immediately. I have only sat down once here in this always crowded restaurant, a popular location among the Chinese in Sunset Park. They serve all the normal items and everything is done at least averagely. The rolls (both cha giÃ² ($3.50 for 4) and goi cuÃ´n ($3.25 for 2)) seem made at least half a day before, but of good ingredients. Their fish and peanut sauces are both up to par. The owner has opened another location nearby at 5624 8th Avenue."
"I tried to be healthy with a kale salad with cheddar cheese, delicata squash, almonds, and pecorino cheese!! It was a great balance & I love how each individual ingredient complements the entire salad. paired with buttermilk biscuits and pumpkin butter. the biscuits are not as heavenly as they could be, but it was a welcome addition to my savory salad. add a fuji apple mimosa that tastes apple soda and you have a happy girl.i could probably drink it by the gallon~~ It is a great place to just grab lunch with a friend to catch up. Nothing mind-blowing, but it is simple food for an average day."
One of the few places that's really poppin' in Astoria at night. Â Great bar with drinks and good food. Â Definitely a place to check out. Â It gets really packed so be ready for that.
"The food here is still very good in my opinion, but honestly, if simple things like panini's and crostini's are bad, you've got a major issue. I've been going here for years now, and there are two panini's that I often order: the Chorizo and the Berkshire Smoked Ham. During the cold months, I like to get their tomato soup that comes with this toasted bread with basil pesto spread. So so good and so so delicious. However, the one bad thing that I've noticed is that they started to lessen their portions.. well I only noticed it for the baby string beans that I ALWAYS start out with. The last time I was there, I really could not believe how small the plate has gotten that I had to say something to the server. Of course she didn't care, but still! It's the little things in life man... come on... I'll still be going back, but no more 5 star status."
"Delicious food doesn't mean liberty for sloppy service. My friend and I ordered two identical burgers and they served only one. I immediately told them we had ordered two, and they said ""oh sure, it's coming in two minutes."" They served the second burger 15 minutes after with no apology, as if nothing happened. I wish they admitted they messed up the order and I would still think it's okay. But they pretended as if they didn't and then didn't do anything to take the blame on. I will never go back."
The best restaurant in the neighborhood. Very unassuming place; spent many evenings eating here after playing basketball at the park nearby. Very affordable Malay food.
"Got the seafood special (lobster, shrimp, scallop in lobster sauce and tarragon $23.95) with freekeh and it was insane nomness in very healthy portions. The owner is a very kind and polite man and seems to be friends with everyone. I cannot believe the whole place is run by two people, so it is understandable water refill was not as prompt."
"Meh. Why go to Eataly and overpay dearly for things you can find at local Italian pork stores all over the 5 boroughs? This place is touristy and not really practical for actually getting Italian specialties. Now if you want to eat here, that's a different story. The place gets pretty crowded so you'll probably have to wait. The Birreria (brewery in Italian) is a gastropub/beer garden that will serve you overrated and overpriced Italian craft beer and overpriced charcuterie and other foods. The view is nice, but is it all worth the crowds and prices? Probably not."
"It was like I was on a scavenger hunt for the perfect N'awlins sandwich. My Yelp app map was homing in on its beacon. Beep. Beep. Beep. All the way to Chinatown with its nondescript storefront. First off, I didn't know what to choose. All the sandwiches sounded great. But as I usually do, I hadn't eaten all day, so I needed something beefy. Â Braised Short Rib, spicy horseradish sauce, arugula, cherry tomatoes, on buttered & toasted challah bread. AWWWW SOOKIE! Guy behind the counter asked me if I was from New Orleans. For a second, I thought I was. That sandwich almost had me speaking in tongues. Of course I couldn't leave without trying the Chicken Biscuit. That I took to-go with an order of Ben-Yays... the teeny tiny babies of beignets. Okay, I'm going to be honest even though it'll make me look like a complete pig. That Chicken Biscuit didn't even make it home. So good. Spicy, perfectly deep fried chicken breast with crispy slaw. *Groan* Good food is always accompanied by sex noises. The location is out of the way and there isn't much desirable seating (oh there are benches aplenty, but more decorative than useful). But I will make the effort to return. The guys behind the counter are just too friendly not to see them again."
"Not only does the view of seeing the guy hand make the noodles, the noodles that come after it are simply tender and so flavorful. The broth is so rich and even the dumplings were mouth watering. The place is pretty shady but the food and the price makes up for it!"
"Peppino's make really, really good pies it has to be said, although I've never been to their Bay Ridge location. Â A little pricey, sure, but they have Park Slope real estate prices to be dealing with and the ingredients are high quality. Â Top notch sauce and good cheese, they're only a few yards behind the tall trees like Totonno's and Juliana's in the crust stakes, but it's high praise even putting them in the same sentence. Â  In any other town, this place would hold legendary status - too bad they're in the pizza mecca of Brooklyn."
"So when I worked in flushing, I used to buy beef brisket soup on main st. Now I'm happy to say I've finally found an alternative that tastes similar and dare I say maybe better! It's the noodles. Now I didn't understand when I read other reviews about the texture but man oh man does it make it a difference. I really can't explain you really just have to try it :) Even the dumpling wrap is not as thick as in other places I've tried and they are not cheap with filling but the wrap is what makes the difference. Really yummy. Now for the soup, I'm in love. I bought the regular beef noodle soup and was surprised at the price and portion! It's pretty a big pretty portion and is only 5.95! Dumplings are really cheap too but I can't remember the price right now. All I know is I spent less than 10 dollars for a good meal. Â The only thing that bothered me was the man who pretty much yelled at me when I asked for hot sauce. Apparently, you take a container at the register and fill it up with sauces on the table which is fine but there was need to yell lol. I will be definitely going back!"
"A very cute restaurant and brunch spot, although not necessarily something I feel would be worth to trek out to Queens for. We sat in the outside area, which was quite nice. For food, we had the eggs and chorizo special and the shirred eggs. The shirred eggs was delicious but very very filling (eggs + lentils = protein overload). The chorizo was very good but it was more like a spiced sausage than a chorizo. Home fries were also yummy and the toast as well."
Best biscuits and gravy ever! And I really like biscuits and gravy.
"Went to the Lemon Ice kings and then got hungry so I yelped empanadas and brought me here. Hooray! Cute little place at the corner of Van Doren and 108 st in corona. I got very excited with the menu. Â They have white flour, Â corn or organic. ( wasn't a fan of the organic 2 dry and bland). I ordered plantain & cheese ( my favorite) Chicken, Ham & cheese and Hawaiian. Â Since I ordered a lot the girl at the register was very nice and threw in an organic chicken for free. Â Toooooooo bad I didn't like it ""( but it was much appreciated. Â She was very helpful since I wasn't sure what to order at first. Â If you are in a hurry order ahead of time bc it takes some time. The least favorite for me was the chicken. Â For a second it looked like beef and was on the dry side. Â 2nd fav was the Hawaiian and ham and cheese (Lil salty but was still yummy). #1 favorite was the Plantatin. Â Saw this was a must try on yelp and it was delish. Dessert: Homemade ice cream. Â Lots and lots of flavors to choose from. Â So delish. Enjoy! The"
"You must order the curry mussels. Especially if you are a mussel fan. The mussel meat soaks up the juice perfectly, giving plump mussels a bold flavor. I think I like their mussels better than Flex, believe it or not."
"My favorite cafe where I find my delicatessen dessert or lunch menu. Â Very organic old traditional ""inaka"" japanese food like, it truly brings me a zen. Â I have been coming here since the opening, and I usually come by myself for it is one place i can breath. Â  I was there last week of june, 2012, Â i think the tea selection has downsized since the beginning but i am still in love with this place. Â I am amazed that after all these years, the food (including dessert) Â and drink quality has not gone down at all. The main reason why I come back here is the dessert is never super sweet like American sugar level, it is delicate and sweet enough. Update: dec. 2014 The tea selection has went down but still an amazing lunch and the dessert! Â Still my favorite!"
"Great burger. Very solid and the reviews did hold up. I loved the sesame bun and the prices aren't bad. The fries are outstanding (I love crispy, thin fries). The menu is very limited but that's the point, it's a bar and burger joint. It's not meant to be anything more than that. Very cool bar and the service was friendly. Not my favorite burger in the city, but it's one of the better ones."
"So I'm back in NYC for a few days and after some major celebrating with fellow coworkers over many, many drinks, the next morning I was in desperate need of something soupy to sooth my stomach. The first thing that popped into my head was spicy beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles. After a quick Yelp mobile app search I was able to find Super Taste. My asian brother from another mother, Jando S. gave it 5 stars. Oh, it must be good then. This place is no frills, a little dirty, and the waitress barely speaks English, but don't let that scare you. All you need to be able to say is ""spicy beef noodle soup"" and you'll be set. A few minutes later a piping hot plastic bowl will be placed in front of you and at that point you should put your head down and slurp to your hearts content, only coming up for air, to wipe the sweat rolling down your face and maybe to take a sip of water. The broth was the most flavorful I've ever had. Noodles had the perfect bounce. The beef was super thin and fall apart soft. I think about this perfect bowl of soup almost on a weekly basis. When I'm back in NY again, I will be making a stop here at least once. Next time I want to try the Mount Qi Noodle Soup. And the dumplings!"
"I'm kinda obsessed. Â Coming from San Diego, California, I know what good Mexican food is. Â This definitely satisfied my craving. Â Delicious tacos...and oh the guacamole must get! Â Margaritas perfectly strong too. Â My favorite part was the Michael Jackson music videos playing at around 9pm on a Saturday night. Â The place gets packed (it is small) so be forewarned. Â I still thought it was worth the wait though."
"What a cute unexpected modern-ish space hidden under the 7 train! I heard about Himalayan Yak from a co-worker and pictured a hole in the wall but behind those big doors is a nice place serving a variety of extremely affordable dishes. I've never had Tibetan or Nepalese food before and (IMO) it's a bit of a cross of Indian and Chinese food. Started off traditional veggie momos. Even though we ordered them pan fried (other option is steamed) they were NOT greasy. In fact, they seemed mostly steamed with just a bit of frying to make the outside a bit crispy. 8 pieces to a serving and they were very plump and generously filled with green veggies and potatoes. The trio of sauces they give you were pretty good (sesame & tomato, avocado and chili) I also had a noodle soup with vermicelli noodles (note: the menu said Bean thread noodles but this was fine too) cooked with mixed vegetables, pieces of dried fungus, black mushroom and potato served with tingmo (Tibetan steamed bun) The broth was really good and veggies fresh, also had a lot of potatos in it which made it quite filling. I didn't care for the tingmo - even though it reminded me of other kinds of Chinese steamed plain buns - it was much blander. My husband ordered a beef dish that was very similar to what we order at a Chinese restaurant in Flushing. Slices of sizzling beef with red pepper, onion, garlic, ginger etc. He really liked it though he didn't' care for the bhaley - another Tibetan bread - also dry and flavorless. Service was efficient, upstairs had live music and decor is nice and more modern than I expected."
"I really have slipped off on my restaurant game recently but this place has restored my faith in the restaurant world once and for all. Their simple menu items are not to be mistakened for anything less than of a delicious dish. I came here with a couple friends for dinner and we ordered their infamous gnocchi and a lobster risotto special as starters. Both were delicious and beautifully presented. I've never been a huge fan of gnocchi, but this place does it well. I had the salmon as my main course and the fish was fresh and grilled lightly to greatness. The sauce, mushrooms and butternut squash complimented the dish beautifully. I really can't say much more but how great the food is- you would just have to try it for yourself. However, I can speak on behalf of the waitress that attended to our table and she was PERFECT. Of course many NYC restaurants nowadays provide you with a refillable water bottle on the table but only ONCE did I have to pick up the bottle and fill it for myself. The waitress still attended our drinks and met all our expectations. I can't wait to introduce this place to friends and family in the future."
"Reading everyone's reviews below here convinces me that brunch is the ticket at this place. I went for a weekday lunch with friends. Waiting at the bar, found the bar-tenders to be super efficient, and really nice, Â very professional Â Wine list was great, as with all of Danny Meyer's places, and an added perk was getting to meet him as we walked in. Nice guy and better-looking than on Am-Ex commercials! A Sandra Bullock look-alike parked herself at the bar for hours, maybe waiting for the actual SB, herself, to show up? Spotted other celebs there as well... Everyone pretended to not notice, which is how we New Yorkers play it. So lunch was good, but not what I had expected. Portions of cheeses and salumi were really small. Fried artichokes were amazing. Spaghetti carbonara was very good but a bit salty. Someone ordered the spaghetti and clams which looked kind of short on clams and served on a plate instead of the usual earthenware little pot, which keeps it warm, but also helps to retain all of the clam liquid that Romans consider essential to a good ""spaghetti alle vongole"". Â Salads were very good. Guess I had the concept of ""Roman ""trattoria"" in my head, and was a bit disappointed. The most Â common item on every Roman menu there is ""abbacchio"" or braised lamb, usually, presented as a plate of short-rib-looking pieces of meat. It was a decent enough Italian place, but not as Roman as say, Mario Batali, might offer, even down to the deserts, which were kind of forgettable. A sliced blood orange, sprinkled with a tiny bit of sugar, for dessert, is really Roman. Biscotti with sweet wine for dunking is definitely not. Â  But judging from the what other reviewers said here, think I'll go back for brunch or dinner to test it out again. You guys are usually pretty much on target."
"Upon receiving an invite to a large party (25 people) on Stone Street, I was initially put off as I've never had a great meal at any place on Stone Street and was a little concerned about the seating logistics. Â Adrienne's was totally able to deliver on a great, tasty meal and the perfect seating arrangement. Â Our group was in the back of the restaurant separated from the other diners. Â We had two high top tables and essentially a ""private"" space. Â  We started off with two massive arugula, parmesan and mushroom salads which I was a big fan of. The mushrooms were perfectly marinated in a vinaigrette and the parmesan was cut into thick large triangles so you could really get a good bite of flavor and texture. Â We ordered several pizzas which I enjoyed. Â The sauce was fresh--you can really taste the tomatoes, and the cheese and crust weren't overpowering but still had a nice presence. Â I'd recommend this place for a big party or for a casual dinner--good service and good food!"
"Hmm I think I need to try this one again. It got such rave reviews but I was quite a bit underwhelmed. Came here on a pouring night and I was expecting a small establishment but this was TINYYYYYYY. Either way, made our way to the back and found a couple dry bar stools and I went to order our nachos (half carnitas and half steak). The cook made jokes with us while he made our order because we wanted no beans on it. It was cool to watch him assemble it and all the other orders though. When we got down to eating it was just ok. I like saucy cheesy meaty nachos and this isn't that. They were more crunchy dry cheesed nachos with hunks of meat which were good but not great. For the price and if I was in the area I'd come again though I'd probably order something different or ask for extra cheese."
"Open 24 hours, this homey restaurant cooks up large portions of fresh, scratch made food that will put your real bubby's to shame. I've dined here for every meal, including a mid-afternoon snack comprised of their famous pie (which is actually how Bubby's got started). I'm somewhat a creature of habit when it comes to my brunch choices. I love a good egg dish and an amazing smoked salmon platter, so, I went for the latter (what's up, Dr. Seuss). I got their Smoked Organic Salmon Platter (cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, capers, cream cheese, homemade bagel). Served on a crisp bed of lettuce, the generous portion of salmon is fresh and delicious. Whether you sandwich it up or eat separately as a smoked salmon salad and bagel with cream cheese, all the flavors go so well together. The homemade everything bagel I chose was perfectly toasted, crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside."
"KICK. ASS. yup... i'm talking about their dumpling skin. It's super super thin and chewy. Pan fried to the right temperature and texture of filling goes well with the dumpling skin. I had their minced pork noodle. It was good, but not as good as their dumpling. I enjoyed the copious amount of bok choy they put on my noodle. The place is grungy as hell but cheap enough for a NYU student to survive off of.... not sure if it's sanitary enough to though.... Â What can I say? You win some, you lose some."
"The wait is kind of long but that usually means it's good food! I was a little confused how the menu worked and I ended up just ordering a slice of cheese pizza, which was easily one of my favorites in nyc. It was on delicious bread without too much sauce. They style of pizza reminded me of authentic Italian pizza I've only had in Italy."
"Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) Absolutely lives up to the hype! 2) Duck confit salad with apple and chard?...YUMMO (plus always nice to see generosity with the protein) 3) Did they put cocaine in that utterly delicious bone marrow popper?! Because oh my damn gimme gimme 4) Entrees were even better than the appeteasers... Orecchiette, loin venison and black bass could be my last meal on earth erday any day 5) Owner dresses smashingly like a badass gentleman 6) Take a deep dip of the chocolate pudding and you'll be pleasantly surprised with layer upon layer of magic (brownie, caramel, choco pudding, cream) Cons: 1) The waitress was too excited to clean up and take away our silverware...even when we clearly had a plate and a half of appetizers left...Aduh 2) The bouncer cards you at the door...as if were a nightclub...this is MADNESS..no this is MANHATTAN!!!"
"great experience to shop, see, and eat Italian food products. Their gelato is so good (had pistachio and salted caramel). Yes it pricey, their gourmet products, but it's just Â a fun experience to try."
"Does the tag ""Southern inspired"" true justice! Chilled squash & basil soup was excellent and the entree, buttermilk fried chicken and cheddar waffles, was up there with the best I've had. Prompt, friendly service, reasonable prices, and a cool Carroll Gardens vibe... What's not to like? And try the Carlos Danger cocktail. But you would, wouldn't you?!?!"
"College kid's dream, cheap prices ($5.50-$8.00), good quantity, made fast, delivers, and tasty. Â I normally stick to their $5.50 menu, and I was almost never dissatisfied. Â Probably ate here at least 30 times in the past year because I lived just a few blocks away. Â Open super late for Chinatown too."
"After entering through the heavy black steel door I felt like I was instantly transported to another place. Â The decor takes you immediately into an island feel where every piece in the restaurant appears to be a repurposed item from a scarp yard neatly repainted and well selected to furnish the entire restaurant. Â An old desk turned into a table, a broken in looking bar counter top and dim hanging lamps. Â A very island feel to everything with some music bumping in the background. We were quickly seated for brunch / breakfast and ordered fresh squeezed orange juice with a deep orange color to it; remarkably fresh. Â A perfectly ripe avocado with a dash of olive oil across it; munster cheese and bacon over smashed plantains, delicious Dominican comfort food. Â The sunny side eggs were perfectly cooked any not one bite was left on the table. The only issue was that the service and server was fine but the food took forever to come out of the kitchen. Â Our orders weren't too complex so I'm not sure what happened. Â I would definitely go back for dinner."
"i sure do love meat. Â wait wait wait, let me rephrase that so u don't get the wrong idea. Â i sure do love meat in my mouth. Â wait wait wait. i'll give the quick lowdown on butcher bar. Â everything here is pretty good. Â the pulled pork, the brisket, the st louis ribs, the pork belly, the chili, the mac and cheese, baked beans. Â yeah i'm a fat cow. Â i had them all in one sitting. Â all probably a 7/10 or 8/10. Â not the greatest i had, but pretty damn good. Â the double smoked burnt ends were probably the best thing on the menu. Â definitely recommend that. the seating is a bit limited as we had to wait because there were only 3 tables suited for parties of 3+. Â the prices here are, i guess, on par with a bbq joint, although i always find them a bit expensive. Â sides range from $4-$8, ribs are $20 for half a rack, $35 for a full. Â oh just look at the menu and judge for yourself, i'm not gonna list everything here. what gets this place a 5 over a 4 is the service here. Â our server stephanie was great. Â very friendly and accomodating, always service with a smile. Â the other servers, i noticed while eavesdropping on the other table, were also very friendly and nice. Â  good food, limited seating, semi pricey, but great service. Â that always bumps everything up a notch. Â 5 stars."
"This place was incredibly gracious with our birthday group of 7, even though we got a bit loud/rowdy at the end. Â The service was great and our waitress took the time to explain the menu well. Â The staff also brought fresh wine glasses in regular intervals which was tres classy. In terms of food, I recommend the crab cakes, bacon-wrapped scallops, meat platter, and cheese platter."
"I LOVE ROBERTA'S. The atmosphere, the food, the beer, the prices. Er'thing. I've been here a couple of times and it does not disappoint."
"Heavenly comfort food. Perfect for soaking up all that alcohol in your stomach. I ordered to go, the pulled pork, chicken and waffles, tater tots, and of course the chicken biscuit. Everything was cooked to perfection. But the pulled pork was a bit disappointing. Otherwise The staff was nice and helpful!"
"What a cool space! It's small, but completely unique and unlike any other wine bar I've ever been to. The bartenders and drink selection were fantastic...and everything we had, from the cheese plate to the olives and drinks were really fantastic. This place is a perfect date spot - it's a small space, and there are little corners perfect for canoodling. But it's also great for a small group...there's even interesting people watching, both in the bar, and outside on busy 5th Avenue."
"this place is absolutely adorable...trendy, but still adorable. i say the trendy part because everyone here is incredibly well dressed. the people behind the bar, the servers, and the diners. the music is varied, but interesting. you remember every song from seven years ago and still love all of them. the tables don't match, there's a sliding window where friendly faces come by to get coffee, and people are always running in and out who know everyone inside. all in all, incredibly comfortable...and trendy. my friend and i stumbled in here last night to get out of the cold, enticed by the decently priced wine list and baked pasta boasted on the menu out front. we of course ordered one of these decently priced bottles of wine, the baked pasta, and threw in the shepherd's pie (though not named as such, but essentially what it was). the wine was decent, not as good as one would expect from a trendy little french cafe, but both dishes were lovely. i'll admit i was more of a fan of the shepherd's pie, but this could just been envy since it was sitting in front of my friend and not me. looking through the rest of the menu, there was an excellent selection of small plates, salads, and other entrees that would keep me coming back again and again. this is definitely the type of comfortable little spot that deserves a repeat visit considering it is very conveniently located down in nolita. more importantly, there is something intangible about a place like this. you walk inside and you're immediately put at ease. the tables are little, making you want to pull everything in around you even tighter, including that person you might be dining with that evening. you're handed a glass for your wine, but none for water unless you ask. exactly the way it is in most of these cafes if you pop in for a drink or a quick sandwich in so many places in the world. you just can't help but appreciate the style of everyone inside. everything inside. definitely worth a visit. but skip the dessert menu. way better sweets at the bakeshop around the corner for a late night snack."
"The signature roast suckling pig is reason enough to make a trip to this solid restaurant in the gramercy park hotel. The food is straightforward and delicious. Another plus is the wine list, both by the glass and by the bottle. They really take the time to know their products."
"I absolutely love this place. The food is tasty and authentic, and very cheap. Last time I was here, three of us ate a mountain of food and 2 pitchers of beer for $60 total. The place is nice, and the service is quick. The only downside is the place's popularity--you'll probably have to wait quite a while for a table."
I love brunch here. Â If you go you must try the deviled egg (I never knew one could taste this good).
"Did not really feel welcome. Â I feel for the ""craft beer"" bait. I soon realized they had only 5 subpar craft beers. Felt creepy and although they were not busy not even the bartender said, Â ""Hello."" Will never return. Â Note. .. I had one beer & left so cannot speak to the food."
The two of us ate at the bar and had a great time. Â We love sharing lots of small plates so it worked out for us. Â  Both the food and the drinks were tasty and not too expensive for what you got. We both agreed that if we were sitting at a table with people who weren't sharing the timing of how courses come out could be an issue.
"Lobster roll with Soda (Ginger Beer), Chips (Sea Salt and Vinegar), and a pickle for $18. New England Clam Chowder for $8 It's rare you find a lobster roll that isn't completely destroyed in mayo and other viciously sweet sauces. The rolls here at Luke's Lobster wasn't smothered with sauce but instead smothered with lobster. It's just great Lobster-on-bread. The chowder ain't bad either. Don't go here if you're afraid of sea-deck themed restaurants and throwback hip-hop and 90's music. Do go here if you're the Grand Marshall for Lobsterfest."
"Holy fuck. I'm usually not a fan of pancakes but this place makes me crave them. Ricotta pancakes with banana, blueberries and strawberries have to have some kind of crack sprinkled on them to make me eat the whole of it and want it so bad during the week when I can't wait to have a Sunday brunch just to eat here. I will say you better up at the ass crack of dawn if you live south of this place because the G is a Ghost Train and/or the bus don't come as often and/or you have a long ass walk from the L AND the line gets long as hell after 10 am (expect to wait at least an hour if you're strolling in hungover at this time) Fun fact: Before Heath Ledger died, he wanted to open this restaurant. His friends opened it up for him after he died."
Get the Gouda Mac N Cheese with Bacon Bits from the menu! Service was awful though. But DAMN that Mac n Cheese!
"Suffice to say at $16 for Sunday brunch including a mimosa and excellent coffee this place is amazing. Try the pretzel crusted fried chicken and waffles .... so good. Make a reservation. This place is tiny and any wait is going to be outside. The one ding is that service is kind of slow. Part of it is the space - it's just not big enough for them to rush from spot to spot immediately. The other thing is that they're not hyper attentive to your every need. The service is very good, but it's not perfect."
"I want to start by saying the restaurant was incredibly nice about a member of our party running late, particularly given the demand for a seat. I had the burger, it was as good as they say, and despite hating shoe string fries, the garlic and rosemary that accented them left me w nothing to complain about. Chicken liver toast also great. Only thing we didn't really care for were the drinks... I had a negroni, was ok but neither one of us could drink my girlfriends cocktail. We switched to beer and wine and all was ok. While we'd like more on the drink side,the food helped us forget."
"Our party of 5 split a full pizza for about $35-$40. Â We put half margaritas pizza & half white-sauce pizza (added sausage & red peppers). Â We came around 5PM on a Saturday and had a 30 min wait. The pizza bread has great texture. Â It's got a nice crunch to it. Margarita pizza - average 3/5 The margarita pizza was decent but wasn't anything special. Â It was also lacking in flavor; I wish it had more toppings or something. Â I think we should've gotten an entire white-sauce pizza instead. White-sauce pizza, added sausage & red peppers - 3.5/5 I enjoyed the white sauce pizza 10x more than the margarita. Â The sausages were pretty good and the red peppers had a nice touch. Â Order this instead of the Margarita pizza. TIPS: -Cash only -Inside surprisingly big!"
"service was great, my fish tacos and burger were excellent. no frills, super affordable and it works."
"We had a really excellent meal at L'Artusi and I want to go back. Right now. I've had some disappointing experiences at NYC restaurants as of late and L'Artusi helped restore my culinary faith. After scouring through reviews my fiance and I decided on here. Checked Opentable and the only available reservation was at 10:15 so we called the restaurant just to check if they were holding any offline. Lucky for us, we got one for 7:15! We got there a few minutes early and upon entering I had a feeling it was going to be a good night. The interior itself was nice; from the decor, to the layout, I was impressed from the start. The hostesses were super friendly and offered to check our coats. We were immediately seated and quickly scanned the cocktail list. I chose the master fizz which was small, expensive, and terrible tasting. I did not let that get me down as we chose our food. Our cheese came quickly and was followed by the pasta no more than 5 minutes after we ordered. We got the following Cheese: Their special was the house made ricotta with cranberry jam and house made crackers. Everything about it was delicious. Â (5/5) 2 Pasta dishes: Ravioli (squash, sage, and brown butter)- It was really good, I just wish the ravioli were a little larger and that they had a little more filling in them. The first ravioli had so little filling that I didn't even taste the squash, others were better but overall they could have more. The sauce was good too. (4/5) Orecchietti- AMAZING. Not enough accolades for this dish. It is a perfect dish for winter. Hearty, slightly spiced, just an abundance of amazing flavors. This dish was so so so good. (5/5) Meat: Braised short ribs- They rested on top of polenta that was not cooked or seasoned very well. The short ribs did not disappoint though. Moist, Â easy to pull apart with your fork, so tender. Pretty good seasoning. I liked it overall. (4/5) We skipped dessert, as we were both pretty full and none really stuck out to me. Our service was good. Not overattentive but not absent. Next time we go I am definitely trying more pasta dishes and skipping the meat. And believe me, there will be a next time."
"Went there with my girl friend, and we love this little cute and romantic tapas place, most importantly, their little dishes are SO delicious. Highly recommend the following: Bacon wrapped dates Short ribs Fried goat cheese Shrimp and chorizo We found these dishes are okay: Avocado relleno Lamb tataki - 3 thinly sliced lamb tataki, taste like beef Pulled pork empanadas"
"I really want to love this place because there is so much beautiful fresh food but the meal I had was SUPER bland. I got something called Grandmaster Veg or something like that, which was described as a vegan lasagna with marinara and cashew sauce. It tasted like simple shredded root veggies with barely any cashew sauce and minimal flavor. I added extra oil and salt but it was still bland. I got a side of chard, which was well-cooked but also somewhat bland."
"It's widely known that the Indians have created and perfected the world's most famous Chicken and rice combination...That being, Chicken Tikka Masala and Basmati rice. Others have capitalized on this phenomenal combination to cash in the profits and *BAM*, you instantly have folks like King Falafel and Shawarma of Astoria, NY. As first timers, we walked up to a bunch of people crowded around the cart haphazardly, while we were looking at their menus which were a bunch of pictures and incorrectly spelled English words hung up on a fence. It's a zoo at this corner because you still have regular foot traffic trying to get by while people are trying to order, read the menus and wait for their cart made goodness to be ready...and you know New Yorkers aren't patient and HATE when people are just standing there on the sidewalk in their way of getting from point A to point B. We ordered the Chicken Kabob platter that came with salad, shredded chicken over Basmati rice, 2 chicken kabobs and 1 piece of falafel, with yogurt sauce and a hint of spicy sauce drizzled about. It was quite good, much better than the original chicken and rice dude in Manhattan midtown on 6th and 54th/55th which I've had several times. The chicken here is tastier, less fattier and heartier along with the rice being more flavorful and the veggies being fresher. It's definitely worth a return trip and for $10 including 2 bottles of water, it's not breaking your bank either! *NOTE* we both had gaseous air bubble pockets under our chest later that day from the spicy cart goodness...it was worth it though."
"I'm not a huge fan of seafood but my fiance is so I took her to Red Hook Lobster Pound once I moved to my current 'hood (it's walking distance). I have to say that the lobster rolls are pretty good. I prefer the standard roll, but my soon-to-be other half is a fan of the warm CT style with butter. I've also been to the truck when it's in Park Slope on Saturdays but the portions seem a bit smaller there. Mind you, paying $16 for a sandwich is not my cup of tea (Katz's Deli excluded), but it's worth it for the freshness of the food and the smile it puts on my fiance's face. The main shop took some pretty bad damage from Sandy, but they've rebuilt and even increased the menu a bit. Customer service can be a bit challenged when the place is crowded. One night we waited 45 minutes after ordering and then they served us sandwiches that had been sitting out for a while. However, after we made management aware of the situation and they we were disappointed, they rectified the situation. Still, I'd probably try and stop by during the slow season."
We were the first at the door on a Sunday morning. Quaint little restaurant. Love the ambience! We had the poached egg with salmon gravlax and eggs benedict. Food came out quickly and was excellent! We stayed to sip our coffee and chat a bit but people kept clearing our table of everything on it and even attempted to take our unfinished coffee mugs. We hadn't been there long buy were asked to leave so that other customers could take our table. Maybe it's a New York thing? Would have been a 5 if it weren't for that ending.
Their BBQ oysters were BOMB. Their fried chicken is mediocre and cannot compare with Pies N Thighs'. Atmosphere is chill. And they have a nice restroom.
"Came here some time ago... Do not remember anything really standing out. Â Drinks were good, the food was good, but not exceptional... What stood out the most was our Spanish friend was drunkenly arguing (with no one in particular) about the Paella - Something about not enough saffron, and how the Cubans were stealing her culture..."
"Came here once and go the salmon rice bowl. My friend got the soba, it was ok. Nothing really memorable about this place."
"Our friends ran out to this place and brought it back for us to try - they got the vegetable and egg soup. Â It was super cheap ($4.00) and super tasty - the noodles were awesome, which is what I was expecting for a place with this name (so descriptive, I love it). Â Next time, I really want to go eat there and try some of their other soups. Â I think for the price, this place is really worth it."
"Every time I come here I plan to get the grilled chicken with salad and rice and instead, get ""stuck"" with a new item. ""Stuck"" meaning have a baby. Thick, char-grilled chicken, starting out with whole pieces that he slices per order. You have the option of doing it over a salad or a rice/salad combo. The salad comes with arugula, tomatoes, cucumbers and. I forget. You can also get some grilled peppers and onions and/or hot peppers. Be aware of everything around you because that's the only way you'll know what to order. Watch people in front of you. You also have the option to dress it with his vinaigrette, hot sauce, BBQ sauce and/or white/tzatziki. This guy Tony's an animal. The ribeye sandwich is so fucking beautiful: grilled ribeye made to order, with grilled portabello's, fresh mozzarella, arugula and you choice of dressings. It's messy but the most beautiful thing in this world. Today I was surprised with a grilled chicken/shishkabob combo and all the fixins. Not your everyday food cart. Also not halal. There will be a line every day. If you're part of the lunch crowd, 11:45am will give you a 15 minute waiting time. But I found out he's also there on weekends from 11am-5pm. Go Tigers."
"Casa Enrique is a small cozy place hidden away in Hunters Pointe, NY. It's warm and welcoming with a clean shabby chic ambiance. We were immediately seated and served with Mexican chips. For appetizers, we had spicy guacamole with three different sauces on the side - it was fresh and very tasty. For the main course, we ordered De Pollo en Salsa Verde and soft tacos with Chorizo & Pastor - both were delicious. Finally for dessert - Pastel Tres Leches, which I thought was overpowered by the caramel drizzled on the top. Overall the service and food were great. Definitely would like to go back to try other items on the menu like Mole de piaxtla!"
"I love this place even though: - The place is packed with rude ass locals - The service ranges from rude to downright fucking hostile - You feel like they just want you to eat and GTFO - Has the ambiance of a nasty cafeteria in a third world country - Features the most repulsive bathroom in the history of mankind\ Why? Because they make some of the best shao-lah - Cantonese BBQ you can find in all of Chinatown. Â I still think their make some of the best roast pork ever and they are even superior to many of the restaurants that serve the same shit in various parts of HK/Macau/Taiwan et al that I've been to. Â Their roast chicken is also awesome. Â They also serve terrific congee (I love their pork/thousand egg congee), wonton noodles (very authentic - def. go for the shrimp won ton noodle soup), and other delicious Cantonese entree selections. Â  Even though many of the folks here are rude as fuck and don't really give a shit about cleaniness (how many fingers in that bowl?), they are fast and if you don't mind feeling rushed as hell (especially when it gets busy) or sharing tables, you'll have a great meal here. Â Folks who felt uncomfortable about this, don't hate on this restaurant just because you're not used to sitting with strangers. Â Yeah I know it sucks but this is common practice in many Asian restaurants. Â And this isn't exactly Per Se. Â It's a fucking hole in the wall that serves great roast pork over rice. Â I don't like being rushed or treated like shit but it's worth it for all this great food!"
"For those people that only read a couple of lines: Don't walk, RUN from here. Â I honestly can't remember the last time yelp has failed me this badly. The ambiance is decent, not great, and would it kill them to clean the dirty bit of wall near the vents? Â Intimate space, though not particularly romantic. I ordered the Kaisen Don off of the lunch menu. Â The miso soup is great, and the presentation was very attractive, but the food was terrible! Â The sashimi appears to have been cut with kindergarten safety scissors by a two year old, and tasted off. Â Its a short time later and I feel sick. Â The rice tasted like crap, how did they screw that up? Â All in all, the entree was extremely disappointing, and at $30 I definitely feel jipped. Now for the egg custard that everyone is raving about. Â Its a soft boiled egg in scrambled form Â for crying out loud! Â I'll admit, at least its edible, but c'mon guys. Do yourself a favor, go someplace else."
"I think this will now be one of my neighborhood go-to spots for a yummy dinner with friends. Had the paella and paired it with a glass of wine. The service is decent, and the wait is not too long. :)"
"I went to Carino for Cinco de Mayo and it was as packed as expected. Â However, the staff here were unbelievably attentive, constantly checking on us and refilling the water; they did not miss a beat. Â Thank you for the great service! On to the food. Â For my first round I had the tacos al pastor, puerco (pibil), and carne asada. Â The flavors of these tacos were amazing, fresh and flavorful. Â I wouldn't consider these tacos to be authentic, especially the al pastor, but they were still pretty yummy. Â HOWEVER, these tacos are tiny, probably the smallest I've ever seen! Â I had to order a second round, so I ordered the chorizo taco and the placera taco, both were delicious. Â The puerco and placera were the most flavorful tacos, but they were all pretty good. Â I also had the elote which really hit the spot. This place is pretty good, I would just like to see them add an inch to the size of their tacos."
"Things you need to know about this gem of a Trattoria: 1) Their menu is short because they only have things they can cook perfectly on it. So everything is good. 2) Meatballs are excellent, get them to start. 3) Have at least one person order the 6-hour meat ragu lasagna 4) The Jesus cake for dessert is a must-have, but very large and sickeningly sweet after 2-3 bits. Either get it with espresso to break up the caramel flavor, or split it 3+ ways. 5) The drip coffee is terrible. They make it in an office style coffee pot behind the bar, take a look. This is the one exception to ""everything is good."" 6) Their draft beers are excellent. During fall, get the pumpkin ale. I know they say they are a wine bar as well but get the beer to start and have wine with dinner if you must. 7) Wine list has a heavy focus on local stuff. I live in Midtown, so it seems limited but well-priced to me. Still if you follow basic rules of wine pairing it will complement your food well. Not sure this is where you would go just to drink wine though. 8) Atmosphere is welcoming. Dress up or down your choice. Medium lighting makes it good for pretty much everything. Generally don't go on Saturday nights, so can't vouch for the service at busy times, but the waiter was engaged and efficient, I'm sure they handle it well. 9) Tip in CASH!"
"Very good!! 3 and a half hour wait for a table, so we walked to a local bar and grabbed a few drinks to kill the time. Worth it! Everything was really good. I loved the strong cheese on the burger, but beware if you can't stand blue cheese. I wish the shoe strings fries were just regular fries, but still very tasty loved the fried rosemary and garlic slivers!! Sooooo tasty! We started with the devils on horseback, tasty, the burrata, delicious, and the gnudi, TO DIE FOR! If/when I go back I might consider ordering the gnudi as my entree and not sharing with anyone! Seriously delicious!! My friends also had the crispy pig ear and the deviled eggs and loved them both! Really good time, server was great and the food did not disappoint. We were so stuffed, we didn't have any room for dessert, even though I really wanted to try it because Â the food was so good. Yeah, I'm definitely going back. :)"
"Fulfilling and tasty Chinese foods with affordable prices, be prepared for the waiting lines."
"Totally overrated. We ordered a main course and the chef dessert assortment sampler and it was a disappointed. The dessert dish was so small and everything looked as if it was suppose to be mini-size. For the price that I paid for the dessert, it was not worth it. I felt ripped off."
"I am quite certain I reviewed it a year ago. Â Middle eastern food served ""Chipotle"" assembly-line style. Â Pick your meat (steak, chicken, falafel) and sides ranging from rices, hummus, eggplant, babaganoush, pickles, olives, salad, etc. The restaurant has plenty of seating; outside, in the front area and also in the back. Â  I have been here about 5 times and they are consistent. Â Meats are seasoned well and veggies are fresh. Â If you like the ""Chipotle"" style of ordering, give it a try!"
"Avoid. Â First time we came here, the tofu soup was so overcooked, the bottom was burnt and it tasted of charcoal. Â They replaced it, but how can anyone mess that up? Came here again today for lunch, ordered the mushroom soon tofu soup which was totally bland, with a few white mushrooms tossed in for effect. Â  The BCD in L.A. is not bad, but this location in NYC is certainly not representing the franchise very well."
"Traif means serious business. This place is one of my favorite I have been to. I have been to Traif five times with my boyfriend and I leave full and happy every time. The first time I came here we ordered different platters such as the frog legs, soft shell crab, muenster cheese dip, strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs, sliders and finally the bacon donuts. I was impressed with everything the first time especially the muenster cheese and the ribs. The next four times that we came I made sure to order the ribs and muenster cheese again. They are by far my favorite thing on the menu. I used to hate BBQ ribs but when I tried the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs from Traif I could not get enough. I could eat two orders on my own. The service at Traif is great as well everytime we came, except for the last. We came with a group of 12 people about two weeks ago and they told us they can seat 8 people at one table and 4 people at another table, but they tried to get us to do the chefs tasting menu. We wanted to sit at the table of 4 with two of our friends and have a separate check because we wanted to order what we like. Â When we asked our waiter to do a separate check for the four of us instead of combined with the other 8 people that came with us. The waiter had a bit of an attitude because we wanted our own check. It did not make much sense for us to pay the tasting menu when there is only four of us. The waiter then went to the manager and told her what we wanted and she was not too pleased, In fact she said a rude remark loud enough behind us so that we could hear her. Other than that night, our service was always great. I was a little surprised about how the acted towards us, but that won't stop me from coming back to Traif and eating again. I most definitely recommend everyone try this place. The food is out of this world!!"
"I love this place! Came here on a Friday night for dinner for 2 and it was packed and we still got a table with no waiting! The front part is a bar and towards the back is the restaurant/lounge. The mixologist is EXCELLENT and the food is great too. A little on the expensive side ($15-$16 for cocktails) but that's to be expected. The staff is engaging, attentive and actually whimsical. They dress up like it's prohibition. Lol. And it's a very mixed crowd but they only play hip hop. PERFECT! Overall 5 out of 5 experience. Perfect for a night out when you want atmosphere but don't want to get too crazy. (They only have one bathroom for the whole place though.)"
"I've had a lot of things from Il Bambino and nothing has ever disappointed. Great ingredients on great bread, made right every time. My favorite thing is the Smoked Tomato Bisque, which they don't have all the time. It's AMAZING! It comes with a pesto covered toasted bread that is garlic-y and good. You can eat it on the side or, like me, dip it in the soup between spoonfuls of the velvety goodness. I've also had the Mozzarella, basil pesto, chili oil Crostini, which has their own chili oil on it. FYI, they sell that at the counter. It's not really spicy, but gives the thickly cut fresh mozzarella more flavor than just the pesto. The Artichoke Panini, with goat cheese, sweet onion and rosemary oil is also divine. Everything they have is the perfect combination of flavors and nothing ever over powers another. BRUNCH: One of the BEST BRUNCHES IN ASTORIA! Which is also served on Fridays! Woohoo! My favorite was the Filthy Sombrero Panini with Dulce de Leche, granny smith apples, goat cheese, and rosemary aioli. It was sweet, yet fresh with the crunch and tartness of the apple slices. I also tried the Notorious P.I.G. Panini with Smoked bacon, scrambled eggs, artisan cheddar, and truffle spread. It too was the perfect combination of ingredients on the perfectly grilled bread."
"Probably one of the more authentic Korean restaurants in K-Town. Lost a star for being a bit pricey, but still a great choice for dinner if you want some legit Korean food. They make their own tofu, so make sure to get something on the menu that includes tofu!"
"I would award Sik Gaek 6 stars, 7 stars, 10 stars if I could!!! Restaurants like these - a mainstream twist on an ethnic cuisine without losing its authenticity - have me trekking out to the outer boroughs more and more these days. Firstly, I'm surprised that very few reviews here mention the decor here at all. When I entered the Sik Gaek, the interior immediately struck me as a reproduction of a cheesy Korean movie set from 1940's. There was a flashing traffic light that seemed to change colors to the beat of K-pop tunes, which played loudly all night. Over the wooden booth seating were Korean ""Giwa"" roofs made of black stone tiles, rows and rows of which hang from the edge of the roof tiling, each displaying menu items written in white. Tin Makkeoli potthat you'd see in a countryside hole-in-a-wall. Befittingly enough, the large, handwritten sign reads ""Nostalgia"" Motel. It's supposed to be reminiscent of a bustling nighttime alleyway in a small Korean tourist city, with food and alcohol served outdoors pop-up style (like Pojangmacha). The menu focuses on seafood - grilled, steamed, hotspots. However the method of cooking, the point is it will be cooked at your table, DIY with some help from the energetic staff! After being seated, the waiter cracked open some eggs into a small pan to make a 3-egg sunny side up. I asked him afterwards about this, and supposedly, the eggs are to serve as an amuse-bouche primarily to protect your digestive lining from drinking that ensues immediately before a meal. Cool. This was followed by Spicy stir-fried rice cake and fluffy steamed eggs, yum! Note that because the menu features dishes really designed for pairing with soju, you won't find the traditional array of side dishes served before the entree. Watermelon soju was perfectly refreshing, not strong but spiked just enough for my weak alcohol tolerance. We later discussed how the watermelon shells must be recycled throughout the day for multiple tables, as there is no way they'd purchase so many watermelons! Now the infamous seafood hotpot ($79.99) There was an avalanche of seafood in a boiling spicy broth, topped with a live lobster; the tail was in a trance of pelvic thrusts and one of the claws snapped backward towards my friend as it succumbed to its death. Oy, quite hilarious and horrifying and at the same time. There was a whole live abalone too, immobile but slowly cooking to its death. Note: The rest is already cooked in the kitchen and ready to eat - whole shrimp, clams with their jaws open, conch, two whole crabs, Plenty of squid, baby octopi, mussels (not as big as PEI mussels but juicy enough) with plenty of cooked cabbage, beam sprouts, and some noodles hiding under the seafood. Washed down with water, soju, watermelon soju, beer or what have you cold, because it's mouth-searingly hot nevertheless, freakin' delicious. The table, of course, ordered the rice to be cooked with the leftover broth as we worked our way to the bottom of the pot. 3 servings for a party of five was plenty. If you're too full, take it to go home!! The rice is supposed to be cooked crisp and lightly fried, so when the waiter takes out the vegetables before putting in the rice ingredients, leave him to do what he knows the best!! It's an Asian paella like you've never tasted before. How efficient of Korean cooking to use scraps to make a whole meal. After a complementary cucumber juice to freshen the palate, our epic meal was over. What a fun dining experience!! The bill came out to $24 per head, a steal of a value! Recommended even for non-adventurous eaters, the seafood lovers and haters alike as they serve meat items too. But the seafood hotpot is the way to go, breaking shells and cooking together."
"A friend and I stopped in here for a blueberry lemon ricotta custard after catching a movie in the Regal Cinemas directly upstairs. The custard was absolutely phenomenal, rich, flavorful, creamy, delicious. It was around 10:30PM and it took every shred of self-control in every fiber of our being to not grab a burger or at least some fries as well. I really like this Shake Shack location because there is ample seating and the general surrounding area is just gorgeous. Battery Park City, you are doing just about everything right. Then again, I've only ever been here in the evenings, so I have no idea what the weekday lunch rush is like. Definitely stop by for a sweet dessert after a movie though! The custards are worth it and the C-line is usually quick!"
This place is charming. We ordered the steak frites which were very tasty. My friend ordered the roasted chicken which she loves. Had the beet salad for my appetizer. It was very tasty! Creme brÃ»lÃ©e Â was lovely as well. Great portions. Decent prices. Attentive staff. Seating is very cramped.
"Friendly service and the sandwich I got, the pilot, was delicious."
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but it always has a super long wait! Came here during lunch time on a week day and I only had to wait 15 minutes! Pros: Super yummy corn. I can't tell what kind of cheese is on it, but it was delicious, and normally I don't like most cheeses! Also, the Cuban sandwich was really juicy! Cons: The chicken quesadilla was unfortunately not very good. It tasted like cancer in your mouth, over-cooked! Overall, yummy experience. I'd definitely come back for the corn and Cuban!"
Thoughtful hostess who seated us even though I had the wrong reservation time. Very thoughtful and attentive bartender/waiter who without me saying anything changed my beer because it was a little icy. Clearly these people care about the place and the food. There was something a little family-owned or something else to the vibe. Excellent food. Especially the stuffed poblano pepper and the fish tacos. Fun atmosphere.Would go back.
"Everything you've read or heard about the food at Taverna Kyclades is true. Â The tzatziki, peasant salad, grilled branzino, bifteki, beets, lemon potatoes, horta and galaktoboureko - all excellent. Â I'm sure a lot of the other things are too. Three things you should know: 1. The interior is quite small and they really cram everyone in, kind of like flying coach on a budget airline - and it's loud. Sit inside for the experience but sit outside for a roomier and quieter meal. 2. Â The restaurant is usually crazy busy and wait times can be long. Service can be a little brusque. 3. Â They accept credit cards but tips are CASH ONLY."
Watching him make the pizza in front of you was worth the wait. Â But not the best pizza I've ever had. Â I probably wouldn't come here again if I was visiting NYC but it was good as a one-time thing.
"Definitely, DEFINITELY coming to this place any time I'm hungry in east village and looking for a place to grab a quick bite. I ordered three of the tacos and my gf ordered a quesadilla. The tacos weren't too impressive, but they got the job done. The pulled pork is meh, the spicy chorizo is amazing though...but only because it's spicy. I think my main complaint was the shell of the taco itself. It was flimsy and didn't really pack as much crunch as I'd like....but then again, it was just a soft shell taco. The quesadilla, on the other hand, was perfect. No bullshit. Just meat and cheese. And it was DELICIOUS. Really excited to try this place again in the future."
"Quite possibly the best falafel I've had. I'm not a big falafel person to begin with, but my girlfriend and I swung by when we were taking a stroll around West Village last weekend. This place is tiny - there are maybe 6-7 stools at most crammed against the wall of the shop, as well as a couple benches outside to eat at. Service is pretty quick, though, and boy is it worth it. We ended up splitting a falafel platter and a strawberry/raspberry smoothie with skim milk. The smoothie was a little overpriced (it cost $5.50), but it was nice and light (probably because of the skim milk), which was a contrast to heavier smoothies served elsewhere. As for the platter...pure Middle Eastern heaven on a plate. My favorite falafel was the Tunisian iteration; the touch of spiciness really adds something to the dish. The hummus was standard, but the pita bread was nice and warm, and the tabouli really was fresher and more flavorful than I've had elsewhere. The additional sauces on the side were all good, but a shout-out to the mango/fruit-infused sauce - that was quite different and contrasted very well with the rest of the dish. For $11.50, you do get your money's worth for sure. This is an awesome little shop right off of 7th Avenue, and if you're hankering for some falafel, this is your go-to shop in West Village. Loved it and will be back! Just make sure to hit an ATM beforehand; they don't take credit cards..."
"Awesome yakiniku!!! As we Japanese would say, ""BAKA-UMA!!!"" So authentic and delicious, reminded me of yakiniku I had in Japan!! Had I known that a place like this existed long time ago, I would've come here more often!! Man I feel like I've been missing out a lot for so long!! Â The assorted Meat BBQ combo for 2 people for $49 is a steal, this is such an amazing value!!!! Â It comes with 8 appetizers like Korean BBQ restaurants consisting kimchi, kakuteki, namul, spinach, sweet & sour radish, etc., soup, rice, 4 different kinds of meat (beef, tongue, liver, chicken thigh and vegetables), and ice cream. The BBQ comes with 4 different dipping sauces and you grill your own meat. We left this place feeling totally satisfied and happy. I'm gonna ditch my Korean BBQ restaurant and start coming here now!"
Great little wine bar. Food is solid and they have a nice selection of wines by the glass. Service is always friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and intimate. It's small but I have never had a hard time finding space at the bar or a table. It's a little on the pricey side - especially if you are going for a full meal. Would recommend for just drinks/apps or just dessert/drinks (chocolate lava cake!).
"My friend kept telling me to go to Eataly, but no description does it justice, and you just have to see it to understand. I walked in through the cafe area and started with a latte machiatto doppio - it was so smooth and was a good boost of caffeine. The dry goods market area has lots of chocolates, sweets, jams, etc. Â The truffle / chocolate counter wasn't as exciting to me as the meat and cheese area. Â They have trays of proscuitto, bresaola (my favorite), other meats, and tons of salami. Â I stayed away from the California stuff, but the imported bresaola and the proscuitto from NY were so good. Â They also have tons of cheeses (the domestic ones were more boring) including fresh buffalo mozzarella. Then there's the focaccia counter, bread counter, and the counter of tons of different fresh pastas, which made me wish I had a kitchen here. Â The produce section had a lot of harder to find fruit including a hidden rose apple, which was beautifully red and so sweet and crisp (but $7.50/lb). You can grab a glass of wine and walk around with it. Â They have tons of Italian wines by the glass, including a sparkling red, which is usually hard to find. Â Pours are very generous, and food shopping is so much more fun with wine in hand."
"Baoburg is a tiny tiny space, which shares a door with the ramen joint next door. Upbeat jazz welcomes you into this cozy nook, which has about 18 seats. Decor is Brooklyn industrial chic with rustic Italian accents thrown in (not very cohesive, but who cares?). Its nice enough for a casual and quick date, with plenty of options to nibble on. They make lovely sangria and have a pretty good drink selection. Menu leans Asian and Spanish, which sounds bizarre, and I believe the owners are Thai based on overhearing the kitchen conversation. But the food was tasty, tapas styled portions of awesome. My table of five ordered: - Â Shrimp dumplings in chili oil (Special) - Â Grilled octopus with canelli beans and eel basil sauce (Special) - Â Chicken liver crostini (Special) - Â Cinnamon pumpkin soup (Special) - Â Coconut mussels - Â Truffle fries The food was solid, relying on sauces to carry the complexity of the dish. The shrimp dumplings were nice and hot. The liver was tasty, without being whipped too smooth or heavy with cream. The soup was surprisingly light even though it came with whipped cream! And the truffle fries with cheese and bacon are pretty impossible to mess up - they were great. The only dish I was meh about was the octopus. The octopus legs were thin and overcooked, to the point where the thinner parts were DRY. The eel sauce was laid on pretty heavily. I love octopus, but this dish was pretty meh. The food came out in waves, allowing us to eat and complete a dish without being overwhelmed. Staff was helpful, quite knowledgeable, quirky, and charming. Since we went on a Monday night, it was super easy to get a table, water refills, and flag down someone to order more food. The staff actually played a trick on us, telling us the truffle fries were sold out, but brought them to our table a few minutes later to surprise us, which was kinda cute. They didn't rush us to finish eating or pay, which was great because my friends were trying to kill some time. The major con: Signage is AWFUL - in the dark I walked by it three times, wondering if I was reading my map wrong. The building doesn't have a number displayed prominently and the ramen place next door is more eye-catching. The menu is displayed, but the name isn't easily seen. Even a chalkboard on the sidewalk pointing to the door would be great."
"If you want pho done right, this is it! Especially good when it gets chilly. Deep and savory flavors. Plus, yummeh vietnamese sandwiches! *Tip* Cash only! Huge portion sizes for the same price you'd get at other pho places---mere mortals compared to the god of SS--- and it's always hopping by dinner time so you might have to wait for a table (seats two) or for a spot at the bar to open up. There's only one big group table, which you probably have to reserve if you want it to be free by the time you arrive with your friends. At an earlier time there's a chance this table will be free, but be warned, there may be a sign on it marking it as 'Reserved'. Don't be intimidated by its popularity at night; the waiting time isn't at all as long as you'd imagine. Probably 5-10 minutes at most, since people here finish eating quickly. Earlier in the day, there'll be plenty of open tables. This is the place to beat!"
"Not sure what the other people meant with negative reviews, but this is my favorite tapas place in the city. I've been here about 3 times and every dish has been a flavor explosion. The goat cheese with lavendar honey perfectly balances eachother out with salty and sweet, and just slightly fried. The lamb tataki is very well spiced, the brussels sprouts are out of this world with just a bit of delicious cream sauce, and the bacon wrapped dates and olives are heavenly with a complementing sweet taste to the bacon. The atmosphere is very nice also. Could be a fun date place (low lighting, small tables, but loud and fun atmosphere), or a fun night out with friends. Check it out."
"Ippudo is the best ramen in NYC and blows other ""ramen hotspots"" (ie: Momofuku) out of the park. The pork buns are melt in your mouth delicious and the actual bun is so light and airy. The Hirata chicken wings appetizer are crispy and super flavorful and so is the Tofu and eggplant Agadashi appetizer. Â All of the ramen dishes have really amazing flavor and you get a ton of the noodles. Â My personal favorite is the Miso Ramen and I add on the spicy paste. Â The Shiromaru Classic ramen is also delicious. Â Not only is the food amazing, but it has a cool lounge-like high energy ambiance which makes it a fun experience. The only negative is sometimes the wait can be brutal and the hostesses can have major attitude. Other than that, Ippudo all the way!"
"Jane has been recommended to me by many people and I can see why this place is so popular. The place is classy and the food is good. The dish I highly recommend the most is their Toasted Ricotta Gnocchi. This is by far the best gnocchi I have ever eaten in my life. Definitely order more bread because the white truffle crÃ¨me was simply delicious. (5/5) Since Jane is known to be a great brunch place, I ordered the Jane Benedict (poach eggs and spinach over crab cakes with hollandaise sauce) . Everything was good about this dish, but I was a little disappointed when I found my crab cake to be cold. (3/5) Next time I come back, I must try the Vanilla Bean French Toast that everyone is raving about."
"Came here tonight (Thurs) shortly after 6:30 pm for dinner. Â It was half full. Â Right after my bf and I were seated, the restaurant quickly filled up. Â For starters, it's not a big restaurant, but for a Thursday evening at 6:30 pm it is a good amount of people.. A good friend of mine recommended this spot. Â I surely was not disappointed, hence it is a good friend! Â  I had the pho ga. Â I love noodle soup and I love pho. Â At first I was a bit surprised that it was chicken pho and not beef. Â I understand that pho can be either beef or chicken, but was just surprised that only chicken was available. Â The broth was delicious, but not the same type of broth from places like pho bang. Â (Definitely not for pho bang's price) Â It was good but doesn't taste like heavy beef or chicken bones were brew for hours. Â The other two dishes have me reasons to return next time. Â We had a fried ""traditional crepe"". Â It was filled with shrimp, bacon and bean sprouts. Â The outside was some egg wrap. Â If you do not like bean sprouts then this dish is not for you. Â We also had the short ribs with vermicelli. Â The short ribs were delicious. Â It was well seasoned and grilled perfect. Â  The location was strangely located in the middle of no where. Â We drove passed a bunch of warehouses to get there. Â I guess this is what hidden gems means."
The food is pretty good and the place is nice. As it is really one of the only good places around newkirk plaza I can't complain. It's a great place to go grab a burger plus for those of us in Midwood Park it's close by. I love the La Vaca and soft pretzels. Not a fan of the onion rings.
"Let me paraphrase this review by saying that I am a Carnivore, a 6ft6 300lbs Carnivore. I often sneer at vegetarians and the closest I've come to Tofu is poking it with my chopsticks at numerous restaurants where it has been served to me. I was in the mood for sushi today, but you know the fish type of sushi. I read some reviews of Beyond Sushi and was impressed so I went to the website. Lo and behold it's a vegetarian spot, so I closed the tab and went back to yelp to find a ""real"" sushi spot. I went through about 10 Sushi restaurant reviews around the area but kept going back to Beyond Sushi's reviews. I decided to set aside my contempt for Human Herbivores and try this spot. The website is beautiful and welcoming, explained everything with great detail and with bright clear pictures. I called and placed my order with the attentive rep, and 10 minutes later I was enjoying one of the best sushi meals I ever had. I ordered the Combo 2 which comes with 2 rolls and 2 individual pieces. I got the Mango and Seaweed pieces plus the Spicy Mang and Green Machine rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious, I can't stress enough how fresh everything tasted. By no means have I been converted to Human ""Herbivorism"", but this spot will definitely be added to my lunch rotation. I loved it."
"Delightful dinner with my guy and his sister & bro-in-law last Tuesday. Â The place was surprisingly packed. My guy had reservations so..I highly suggest that for dinner. I ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer - I don't suggest this dish. It was quite disappointing. My guy started with the squid which was AMAZING. He wasn't a fan..but i enjoyed it. I ordered the lamb as my main dish.. VERY TASTY. Not flawless..but well seasoned.. I was very impressed. He ordered the Maine Sea Scallops - It was extremely good. He felt the place was average..but I thought it was good. I am usually disappointed when it comes to American places.. I think some dishes are hit or miss..but some are quite tasty.. Coupled with ambiance & presentation, I will return another time."
The lunch special is a great deal but not as filling as it looks. Still a solid choice.
"Ok so I'm dinging them a star for the bartendress ripping me off. I even considered giving them 1 star on that alone but after a moment of reflection and my new Buddhist mentally, I'd like to think it was an innocent mistake. I got there early on a Wednesday evening for a 6:30 dinner reservation. I've visited the bar here a few times but never eaten. I'm a sucker for the Manhattan on tap but seeing as it was a first date and I was 40 minutes early, I didn't want to be tipsy upon first meeting. I know that they make all their cocktails from scratch and the bartenders do some nifty moves but is it really necessary to charge north of $15 for most of the cocktails that come in glasses not bigger than a shot glass? I decided to do something mellow and try the ""cup of punch"" I asked the bartendress for a taste but she said she makes it from scratch. Meh, it was OK, it taste like a watery sangria with a hint of spice, feel free to skip it. When my date arrived our table was ready and he was starving so we decided to have cocktails at our table. As he was checking his coat I gave the bartender a $20 to pay for my punch. She gave me $8 back....uhhmm, on the menu it says the punch is $7 but at that exact moment my date walked back and I didn't want to sound like a cheap ass so I didn't point it out, I'm still annoyed by that. Oh well, maybe she though she gave me $13 back? Whatever. The Hostess sat us at a private little table in the back, scored some stars back on that one. Our waitress was great. She wasn't trying to sell us on a ton of food or the most expensive thing etc, she was just honest and helpful. I wasn't as hungry as my date so I decided to order a few appetizers as they all sounded delish. I chose the roasted butternut squash salad, kale, toasted pumpkin seeds, cotija cheese, pomegranate seeds, green goddess dressing over the brussels sprout leaves because I wanted some of those truffle fries and our waitress said the other salad was heavier. This was a great salad, not a ton of flavor but very clean and fresh. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts with some sort of candied sauce on them, a MUST order. My date went with the burger and fries and it was one of those burgers that is stacked impossibly high with absolutely no chance of eating it daintily. He said it was fabulous. The fries came with his meal so I didn't order more, they were SO good but could have been just a touch hotter. The dessert was the real star here and I would go back to drink Manhattans, eat Brussels sprouts and fries and order 2 orders of the s'mores!!Warm chocolate pudding, graham cracker, lemon marshmallow, whiskey barrel smoke. This was easily the best dessert I've had in a LONG time. They serve it in a sealed mason jar and when you open it smoke comes out. It tastes just like campfire s'mores!! well I guess if Thomas Keller was making them. The pudding, graham cracker and especially the marshmallows were pure heaven. I'm drooling thinking about it now!! All in all, I would go back."
"We ordered with our hearts! How could we go wrong? This place is so quaint and perfect it makes me say horribly embarrassing things like that. Red wine consumption and *extreme* mushroom pasta excitement aided in the above proclamation, but still. This place is magic... and I need a filter. Emporio is made up of two halves, the front room, a wood-clad bar area, and the back, an atrium-turned-bustling dining room. We sat in the dining room, squished between two other tables. The candlelight, glass ceiling and aromas made the busyness around us melt away. We started with a red wine we couldn't afford and a cheese plate that was very reasonably priced, and then moved onto the mushroom pasta and a mushroom pizza. We questioned overdoing the 'shrooms, but we ordered with our hearts... so nothing went wrong. This is the best Italian meal I've had outside of Italy. I'm completely enamored with Emporio. PEPPER PAUSES before exiting the restroom. These one-at-a-time facilities are right in servers alley. You could seriously disrupt someone's supper if you exit too quickly."
"Who says you can no longer get a cheap meal in New York City?? Prosperity Dumpling proves that theory wrong! A true hole in the wall on the lower east side, but delicious dumplings and other items that you can't get anywhere else for such a great price. Food- I like the veggie dumplings and the sesame pancake is a particular favorite of my husbands. There are a couple of seats, but not a great sit down place to enjoy your food. Take it to go or stand outside and devour your goodies."
"Oh Yorkville, you are making me even love you more. Bondurants is an awesome new bar addition in the area! Super craft beer selection that rotates weekly. Superlative whiskey list. Some terrific house cocktails to choose from along with a small eclectic food list. Inviting rustic decor with cool rock music playing. A more adult mixed crowd that flies in the face of the frat boy clientele in the area. How did this wonderful place happen to show up here and not in Brooklyn or the LES? Oh, that's right! Because the UES/Yorkville part of town is starting to explode with great bars and restaurants all over! Once the 2nd Ave subway is finished this will become the hot spot of town to eat and drink at even more so. For those of us who live up here we know this is the ""undiscovered country"" with many gems that those who refuse to venture above 14th street even know about. That's ok, because we like it that way. I don't even have to leave my hood anymore to have a great beer, quality cocktail, or tasty meal. Yorkville: The final frontier. To explore strange new bars, to seek out new restaurants and new gathering spots, to boldly go where no man has partied before! (as narrated by William Shatner as Captain Kirk) The whiskey list here is pure quality with so many to choose from. From Makers 46 to Elijah Craig to Larceny to Rough Rider and more. Impressive! I can walk in at any time and enjoy a creamy Nitro Stout brew or sample any of the beers on their board until I find one I like. Terrific bartenders here who are friendly and will offer top notch selections when you are on the fence about what you want to drink. Hungry? Try the Frickles or Roasted Almonds to nosh on. Their seasoned IPA Fries are addicting! They are perfect to go along with a beer or cocktail. Oh, the cocktails are fine! The Maggie Valley and Take It Easy Baby will surely cure what ails ya. Â  Large octagon shaped bar centers the room with some tables and window seating around it. Spacious and can get a bit crowded as the locals have taken to this spot, but always a space to hang your hat. Pure inviting ambiance that makes me want to call this my new neighborhood bar home. This ain't your grandparent's Upper East Side anymore. Love it!"
"Pretty damn good ramen in NYC. Came here years ago for my first ramen experience and I keep going back. Â Chicken buns and fried chicken are always a must. Â There's always special appetizers to try also. Wasabi shoyu ramen is light but full of flavor, the noodles are thick and chewy, add an egg and you're set! Â Calpico soda is also a must!"
"Here's three pieces of advice: 1. Get Da Jay. It's the grilled pork banh mi, and it's the best of the three different sandwiches that I've tried here. Although, I've never really been sad about any of them. 2. Don't get delivery if you can help it. It's quick and reliable, but the food definitely loses a little something on the way. All food really does. 3. Don't go anywhere near this joint from 3-4 pm. In fact, stay away from the Slope altogether anytime school is letting out. Because strangling annoying middle schoolers is seriously frowned upon unless you're also a middle schooler, and even then I'm pretty sure it's not OK."
"I like this place and food. It was little bit difficult to order at one time though. We cannot know how many dishes are enough for us even though they told us two/three dishes per person were enough. First, we ordered two dishes each and find out it was not enough, so ordered again. Then my friend really wanted to order again. They allowed us to order three times, but it is not acceptable all the time. Anyway, the food was great. We enjoyed."
"If the idea of ordering something from the menu and then having something totally different show up in front of you appeals to you, then this is the restaurant for you. What dish #1 was supposed to be: broccoli and cheddar scramble with creme fraiche and chives. And according to the waiter, one of their most popular dishes. What dish #1 actually was: watery scrambled eggs and broccoli, withOUT creme fraiche or chives. I'm a really terrible cook but even I could have made a better scramble than this. At least my egg scrambles aren't wet. What dish #2 was supposed to be: baked brioche french toast with almond custard. What dish #2 actually was: three pieces of custard. I kid you not, it was literally just custard. I may have found 3 flakes of what potentially was bread, but 99.7% of this plate was custard. We specifically asked the waiter what this dish was like, and he said oh it's really good but kind of heavy. Would have been helpful if he told us it was heavy because it was custard. It got to the point where we were both wolfing down french fries because they were the lightest part of our meal. That's never good."
"Heads-up that I'm reviewing this place as a herbivore, so my experience may not be relevant to folks who eat fish....(Though I will say that the seafood dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen seemed fresh and interesting, and my neighbors seemed to really be enjoying their platters of sushi and nigiri.) What I like most about Momo is that, unlike a lot of other sushi places in the city, they have definitely made an effort to offer several tasty vegan options. The standouts for me were the lotus root appetizer, the mushroom and avocado maki roll, and vegan shitake eel bomb. The tempura of maitake mushrooms, sea beans, and fiddle head ferns was really tasty and interesting, but felt pricey at $16 given the small portion size (2-3 mushrooms, ferns, and bean clusters per plate). Having just spent a week in a Florida beach town where the only vegan option on every menu was an iceberg salad (hold the ranch dressing), I know that I should be really grateful to have had multiple tasty plant-based options at Momo. I guess I've become a spoiled New Yorker, though, because I have to confess that i was a bit miffed that there wasn't more variety among the veggie sushi offerings. Basically every single item featured sauteed cremini mushrooms, tofu cream cheese (???), and/or pickled vegetables when there were so many other delicious vegetarian items already on the menu that would have made really interesting maki fillings. I'd love to see the chefs craft rolls or bombs out of sea beans, lotus root, cashews, or whatever tasty produce they have on special. Â Given the overall creativity of the menu at Momo, it just seemed like there were some missed opportunities. Also, vegan mayo is delicious and cheap: I'm fully aware I'm being a brat, but why not have a little on hand to dress up our bombs, too?"
One of my fav spots in astoria. I come here quite often and bring my friends to try arepas. I always order arepas pabellon. Soo goood. Great lunch deals. The chicken soup is delicious. Love their drinks. Good spot!! Its small but i never had to wait.
"If you haven't given brunch a try at Swine yet, you really really should. I arrived at noon on Saturday, right as they were opening. The bartender was the first to notice me (it was quiet, and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go upstairs or down) and offered me a coffee right away (yes, please!) and after handing me a menu, he asked if I wanted a cocktail. I was beside myself with happiness. My friend arrived and she ordered the country breakfast, and she loved the biscuits. They were so good, she got another order of biscuits. Oh, and we did the bottomless brunch cocktails and had about three to four bloody Mary's each. I went for the grand swine. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the pork sausage was unbelievably amazing, along with the bacon. The waffles, however, were a little on the soggy side. Our server was so nice. He kept our coffee cups full and didn't rush us. We sat there for about 2.5 hours! I have to come back to try that marrow and brisket burger. My mouth waters just thinking about it. Oh, and props on the spacious rest rooms + adorable signage."
Best Pork buns ever! Ramen is good but have had better and definitely not worth waiting for 2 hours. Go there for the drinks and pork buns at the bar.
"My wife and I came here to celebrate my birthday, and we had an excellent meal. Â The waitress was helpful in helping us decide what to order. Â I had couple of glasses of Red Pearl which was delicious. I didn't like the drink Rude Little Pig so much, but the waitress was gracious enough to replace it with another Red Pearl. Â  Apparently ordering 6-7 dishes is standard for a group of two, and we ordered 7 small dishes. I am now thinking maybe we should have ordered just 6, since we were quite full at the end of the meal. Â  Pluots with bacon and blue cheese was amazing, as was the pork belly. Â The scallops were seared to perfection, and I plan to go back again next time there is an occasion to celebrate. Â We've been here a couple of times and Traif has been consistently 5 stars."
"I've been coming to this place for years, I don't know why it's taken me so long to review. It really has become a go-to restaurant for me, whether it be breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner or my favorite after-hours, the ever-so-classy drunken binge at 5am after the party. Must haves: Blackberry lemonade, mac and cheese spring rolls, lemon ricotta pancakes, the soup and sammie, fried chicken and waffles and the deep fried Oreos. The service is usually quick, very sweet/personable and efficient. It's usually pretty busy, so expect a wait (and a bit of a noisy atmosphere) most of the time, but don't let that deter you. The prices are reasonable for the portions. It's hard to go wrong here, I've honestly never been disappointed. Always looking forward to returning!"
A nice little boutique Asian grocery store in sunnyside. Ims very glad I do not have to go to flushing to pick up a bunch of these goodies. Store is very clean and laid out with everything easy to find. Its great because most food stores in the area don't carry a lot of these specialty items.
"When I love a place enough to want to give it 5 stars, I struggle with it and somehow convince myself into lowering the rating because it was too loud, or too quiet, or the server once brought me the wrong dish, or the pillow cushion wasn't soft enough, or some other such lame reason. I'm such a nitpicker. I tried to do that a lot with Luzzo's. No matter which way I cut it though, I found myself here almost every week, and recommending it to everyone I knew. Luzzo's get the most important thing right, their pizza. Oh that tangy garlicky tomato sauce. Those fresh dots of mozzarella. That thin, thin crust, almost collapsing under the weight of the most minimal toppings. Those fresh basil leaves. There's no subtlety or gimmickry in the food here. Just clean and simple flavours, and amazing textures. Gimmickry there is in the decor though - It's a little bit like Italian Alice in Wonderland. open brick walls and a TV showing music videos. Upside down furniture on the ceiling and mirrors everywhere. It's just a lot of fun. Service is friendly and efficient. They'll keep your water glasses filled and your tummies full. I have a friend who said she doesn't dig Luzzo's because she doesn't like thin crusts, or charred edges, or what she described as the 'lack of cheese'. I'm just going to recommend the Chicago Deep Dish pizza to her then. For me though, I'll always have Luzzo's."
"This is a place for crepe. I like the chicken curry. But after eating half of the crepe, I wanted to eat something different to balance the taste. But this place sells mostly crepes."
"I have been a few times to Jacob's pickles and it's constantly good. The food and drinks is always nice there, though the waiters do rush you sometimes (where I usually insist that we are still eating our food). The atmosphere and decoration is very nice, which is the reason I visit frequently. It's a pity they removed from the menu their orange sausage with was a favourite plate to accompany beers. I hope they bring it back soon!"
"This place is really tucked away and I almost missed it. It's right on the 2nd floor close to one of my fave Jap shabu shabu restaurants. My friends and I don't understand Japanese tradition, so when we ordered the 3 dessert item and we only got 1, we figured we misunderstood. But luckily about 15 min later we got the other 2 desserts. Needless to say, the desserts were bite-sized. Despite the food being nothing spectacular, the tea here was awesome. I don't remember what my friends or I had, but it was very good. Just come here with friends to sip tea and munch on bite-size desserts after dinner somewhere else, especially when you're trying to pass the time and have nothing better to do."
"This place was packed, as usual for Sunday afternoon brunch in NYC, but the wait for a table outside on a beautiful day was only 20 minutes. They sat us quickly and we ordered the Bacon Bloody Mary which comes with a shrimp and was awesome! As long as you like it pretty spicy it's awesome. We ordered the Eggs Benedict and the Huevos Rancheros, both were excellent and we finished the entire thing. Great portions and good service. Not too pricy either for brunch in the city. Highly recommend for brunch!"
"ok ok, it actually lives up to the hype! I went in thinking it was not going to be nearly as good as the reputation, but I was happily proven wrong. Tried the spicy pork (favorite) classic beef with some of the different sauces. Everything was delicious. Great texture on the meat - flavorful and the price is right for sure! Side of polenta was creamy, side of rigatoni was cooked to a nice aldente. The only downside is the wait. Regardless of the day of the week or time, you will wait at least an hour. It is wildly popular and its tiny. Good news is they have a great texting system to let you know when the table is ready and plenty of bars in the area to kill time. Give it a try, you'll be happy you did."
"This is an experience, not a restaurant or a gourmet grocer or a beer garden, but all of the above. We only eat at the Vegetarian station, but I can report that there are plenty of places to sit and enjoy any particular cuisine or genre from pasta to meat to cheese to wine to chocolate to bread to beer...and everything is gourmet, almost everything imported from Italy, and all for sale. It can get pretty damn crowded, but I think that is part of the fun, if you're not one of those self-important ""serve me now"" a-types. If you can be patient, the turnover at the various stations is quick enough."
"This place is pretty decent. Their XLB is pretty juicy. However, when comparing this to Ding Tai Fung it just doesn't compare. I'm not that big of a fan of DTF but I do like the skin of DTF's dumplings. Here it's kind of just big saggy and juicy. It's tasty but probably not worth waiting in line for. Luckily when I went it was pretty empty and got seated right away. I also got the rice cake noodle soup which was actually pretty good. The restaurant is small so we sat next to another couple really close. I wasn't too sure what the service charge was on the bill. I asked the waiter if that's tip and he said yes. Hopefully that's really what he means because I didn't leave anything else. lol"
The food was fabulous but I felt like the service was lacking at best.
"good oysters. the rest of the food is abysmal. also, it's cramped as fock. however, nothing keeps me away from $1 oyster HHs :)"
"Let's talk about that bread basket. Not a bread person but if it's in front of me, I will eat one. And I did! Soft and a little chewyyyy and that butttterrr. STRAWBERRRY BUTTER??????? Can I have second and a third and fourth????? My friends recommended me this brunch place last Dec, and I am so glad that I came here. I was really blown away by the flavors. I had tried a lot of brunch places in NYC: Norma's, Max B, Jane, Cupping Room, Sarabeth's, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by the great food! I had the Cachapa de Salmon and my husband had the burrito looking thing with green sauce. Both were so amazing. My salmon was literally a bite. I finished quickly and just wanted more. Good job Calle Ocho :) I will definitely come back again!"
"I went to Nyonya with two other people... I couldn't tell you if I was sitting next to my roommate or my GF, all I can remember from that night was the image of my arms in front of me swooping at impossible speeds, testing sauces, dipping breads, devouring rices, and tearing through the unbelievable meats. Nyonya is a 5 star restaurant... not for a second did I think otherwise. I wish I could list every dish that I ordered, but I just told the waitress to bring out the best dishes from each category. The anger perpetuated by the one hour wait shortly evaporated after eating one of their unbelievable chicken wings. I didn't eat all day, so don't hate on me for fully consuming 8 dishes... Everything I ordered was perfect, and from what i've heard and experienced, Nyonya is on par with Malaysia's best. Â  I ordered: Roti Canai,Nyonya Lobak,Nyonya Seafood Rice Noodle, Nasi Lemak, Nyonya Chicken Wings, Mango Chicken, Duck With Ginger & Scallion Over Rice... and maybe two other dishes that I can't recall. I can say without a doubt that the Nasi Lemak was the best rice dish I ever had... end of story. If your not sure of what to order, ask the waitress or waiter... he/she will not let you down. Saying the staff was friendly would be a lie, but you need to take into consideration that this place was packed as hell... this restaurant is in the heart of chinatown so as you would expect, the English language was of no importance to the server... but I kind of liked that, I really felt like I was out of NYC and in the heart of Malaysia. Bottom Line: If you enjoy ethnic food, you better get your ass to this restaurant... it will NOT let you down... and I guarantee you that you will leave their very satisfied and wanting more. Â After licking the sauces off the dishes... I think I even licked the neighboring table's dishes... I was expecting a $100-120 bill. Boy was I surprised, for three people and 8 dishes the meal cost $60... I was blown away, and pleasantly surprised. Any restaurant that has an opposite spectrum rating ie. a one dollar sign rating and a 5 star dining experience rating, is an absolute must! Side Note: They only take cash... uh, and also, don't use any ATM's on grand street... I'm pretty sure that my debit card was compromised that night."
"I want to eat their fries everyday. I dream about this place every night. I want the deviled eggs right now. Chicken liver toast is out of this world. Salads are all fresh and delicious. Great service, great food, cool bathrooms. I love you SpottedPig."
"Very good tapas place. Been there many times. Try the potato and cheese, croquet, and the tomato paste bread. A bit nosy. I recommend a reservation. Bring $$$"
"I love brunch here. I came for blood pudding waffles and hash browns. It is so good, it makes me want to come for dinner to try what other good stuff they have. No reservations, fast seating, great service, strong and good coffee. Bloody mary's are strong and spicy. I also do like the location if that has anything to do with it. Not too many rubber neckers and its on a quiet corner. Cute balcony for 2 table seating for groups of 4 or more. The bathroom has complimentary individualised bars of branded soap. Its a nice touch."
"Nice ambience, but food didn't wow me. Highlights: Bread basket was pretty delicious. Now, they didn't actually serve each table with a bread basket. They came to you with a big bowlful of bread, tell you what it's in, and ask you what you want. If you didn't know any better, you might feel bad about asking for more than a piece so just say one of each. I thought the chipotle and cranberry bun was really delicious; spicy and sweet and chewy too. The focaccia was really nice as well. I got the pan-seared foie gras on spiced french toast with mango chutney, maple glaze and crispy bacon - foie gras was heavenly. I thought the flavor combination was interesting. Rather sinful, for sure. I also had a gnocchi dish with mushrooms served in a dashi broth with yao choy veggies; it was quite an interesting dish. The gnocchi seemed to have been seared on the outside, and it had a wrinkly brownish outside and a soft pillowy inside that was quite good when it was warm but felt and looked more like tofu puffs. My boyfriend's pan-seared Tasmanian sea trout with carrot-cardamom puree, hibiscus braised fennel, chick peas and edamame; I thought was kind of bland. I thought it might just be because I only had a couple of bites, but I asked him what he thought and he has nothing else to add. Cool thing about Public: The bathroom has bars and bars of complimentary soap. Interesting form of self-advertising. Overall: Not coming back here."
Always a long line but we didn't have to wait long since we were willing to sit at the bar. We got a small pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was good. They use fresh mozzarella and basil. I was hoping the pepperoni would be a little spicier but it was good. People friendly took a little bit to gt served though.
"Everyone always complains about the long wait to get into this restaurant. Sure, you can't call in with a reservation, but that's okay. I came here twice, once for dinner on a Friday, and once for Lunch on a Saturday. Both days, I must have gotten lucky, for I waited no more than half an hour to get seated. Everyone always talks about how good the pork buns are. They truly are food sent from the heavens, though having too many can and will make you sick. The ramen choices are quite extensive and the combinations alone will boggle your mind. Combinging pork belly with any ramen is something I personally like to do. I would recommend this place to those looking for ramen, it's definitely a delicious place."
"My best friend surprised me here for dinner as part of my graduation celebration. I don't usually eat in this part of town because I live super Â Downtown, but I am always up for a new culinary adventure. I completely trust Stefie with my life and especially trust her when it comes to food because her foodie expertise are just out of this world. She sure knows how to wine and dine, so when she said she picked somewhere special for dinner, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed and I was promptly prepared to have my mind blown. After leaving Ai Fiori I must agree that this place is definitely somewhere to take someone special and also the perfect place for celebrations. Maybe a tad more on the romantic side, Ai Fiori is a classy and perfect place to celebrate! Needless to say, I was not disappointed and still think fondly of this dinner! Ai Fiori is a beautifully elegant restaurant located Midtown. The massive staircase leads you up to the restaurant and the amazing experience that awaits you inside. We started with a chilled soup and finished with many chocolate desserts. There is a reason why Ai Fiori is Michelin rated- they deserve it! The cocktails here are also amazing. Stefie loves the chef Â here and we were excited to try this restaurant out! When we left, they gave me a ""Congrats"" card, a shout out on Twitter and also a copy of Â the menu of what we ordered to remember our celebration!! Â Wow, talk about feeling really special! Â You really get the full treatment here, and I fully expect to be back soon! Thank you so much for an amazing dinner Ai Fiori! * Michelin Star"
"I was in search of a nice brunch place that would cater to our big group and discovered Le Grainne through my ever so reliable Yelp app. Much to my delight, I found out this was located literally on the same block as our apartment rental in Chelsea. Convenient! They don't take reservations which was fine since we lived so close. I thought the wait would be terrible on a Sunday but they had a table ready for us within 20 minutes. Wonderful! Here's what I tried: Latte---Ordered a large and it was served on a bowl. Literally! It was steaming hot and was the perfect way to start the morning before the bubblies came. $4.25 Mimosa---No brunch would be complete without this. I just wish they offered an endless mimosa deal for Sunday brunches. $10 a pop is quite steep, don't you think? Escargot---Served with the shells, the platter was overflowing with garlic butter. It was a popular dip on the table after all the escargot was devoured in seconds. $9.50 yelp.com/biz_photos/le-gâ€¦ Les Moules Mariniers---Huge pot of mussels. The broth was exceptional but I was surprised to see how tiny the mussels were in size. In quantity, there was plenty. I guess I'm used to the bigger ones here in the West coast. Otherwise, it was a flavorful pot that I truly enjoyed. $19 yelp.com/biz_photos/le-gâ€¦ Fettucini Carbonara---It's an unlikely find on a french bistro menu but I welcomed the sight of it as I was craving something comforting. This did the trick! The pasta was cooked al dente, sauce was creamy and tasty, and the bacon and peas served their purpose for added flavor. It was really good! $19.50 yelp.com/biz_photos/le-gâ€¦ La Danielle---Crepe with ham, cheese, and egg. Sounds ordinary but don't be fooled. Their crepe is just WOW! The whole thing worked together like magic. Leave it to the French to make something simple so delicious and beautiful! Â Served with a side of mesclun salad. $12 yelp.com/biz_photos/le-gâ€¦ Service was fantastic! We stayed there for a good hour or so and being it a Sunday, people started trickling in and the place was packed. They were busy and yet they were able to give us everything we needed without asking. They checked in on us regularly to see if everything was ok. They were awesome! French little cafe that is reminiscent of an actual cafe in Paris with a few tables outside and more inside, where you can people watch while enjoying a good meal with bubblies or perhaps a cup of coffee...I could definitely see myself being a regular here if I lived in the city. I'm a fan!"
"maialino was recommended to me for brunch by two different people and the pictures on the website looked amazing so i had to try it. i loved the contrast to the very dark gramercy park hotel, the casual area in the front of the restaurant and the sit down part in the back. the restaurant is bright, cute and homey. everything looked so good so between two people, we did order a LOT. we started with a cappuccino and a mimosa made with freshly squeezed orange juice. i tried their oj alone as well... why do restaurants insist on oj being warm when it's fresh (aka normas as well)?? it was still delicious (better than normas!). anyway, we also had a toffee brioche which was very good, like the center of a cinnamon bun. for entrees, we ordered THREE because the portions looked light. we had the scrambled eggs with pecorino and pepper, the porchetta sandwich and the smoked swordfish. the side of sausage, spinach and pecorino was really the highlight of the whole meal - it was the BEST sausage i have ever had. i also thought the swordfish with picked onions and argula had a nice balance but it was very hard to taste the fish itself. and my boyfriend really loved the porchetta sandwich, which i thought was OK - kind of bland. i would not order the scrambled eggs ever again as it was way too runny and cheesey and peppery for me but maybe that's the point? overall, the restaurant is very cute and very different for lunch. i did like the items i got and would definitely try more (such as the baked eggs in the tomato sauce and the side of thick bacon)."
"After bickering in front of Caracas Arepa about whether it's sister-spot to the left is a restaurant or not (PS, it is, but that's really not the point), we decided to wander aimlessly around Alphabet City looking for food. I say ""wander aimlessly"" because I was banned from Googling, Yelping, or FourSquaring nearby hotspots. And thank God, really, because when we walked past the abandoned-dock facade of Eli, we all agreed it looked like the place we wanted to stuff our faces. Spaetzle, good. Â Ribs, good. Â Schnitzel, unbelievably good. Â We sat at the bar, which strangely made getting water very difficult, but it was delicious, and we didn't have to wait. I hear they have a garden too - less important than making sure to use their dark, super-artsy bathroom. Â Which is a must."
"I've never been more disappointed. I was told this was the best ramen shop in Manhattan--can not miss, et cetera. Coming from the Bay Area, I was naturally excited. So after the first few days of work, I finally found some time to head over. I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, and was absurdly excited. Oh gosh. Two slabs of pork, egg, non-curly straight over-the-counter ramen, some red ginger and the world's most forgettable broth. I almost how much I paid--oh wait, $15. And I was hungry after 15 minutes. What else? We waited an hour at 9pm. We also ordered an appetizer special: Green beans and enoki mushrooms wrapped with thinly sliced pork, served with Ippudo sweet chili sauce (fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaiâ€¦). Food looked pretty on the plate but ultimately tasted like bacon-wrapped, green beans--except the green beans gave so much of the juicy, cardboard taste/texture that the thin pork just ended up as thin bacon/cooked prosciutto with minimal ability to add anything else to the dish. Look, the reviews here are clearly great and I trust other Yelpers. Give the place a shot. The waiters yell hello (and not in the traditional Japanese friendly restaurant way--they literally all scream) when you come in, Â it's dark, the seating is not ramen bar style but on the ground-sushi boat style, the food is mediocre, but that was for me, a Bay Area ramen fan."
"My colleague raved about this place several times but never knew the name of the place. So today, she finally took me here and I ordered the #14 and added prosciutto for $2.50 extra. All of their subs are 14"" long. Â It was almost as long as my keyboard and looked like a new born baby. It was huge. My sandwich was supposed to come with chicken breast, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and arugula. They gave me turkey instead of the roasted chicken which is fine with me, but I would have appreciated a heads up before the switcheroo. You also get to pick the bread that you want. I paid $1 more to get the brick oven Sfilatino bread which was crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. Overall, it was a great sandwich. I paid close to $16 for the beast but it could have easily been split with someone. And had I not ordered it with prosciutto or the premium bread, it would have been Â $10.90 which is a bargain since it's so big and can be eaten as two meals. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. I am a fan and will definitely be back!"
Sunday Suckling Pig! That's what all the boards read. And it was Sunday. But... (cue the sad trombone) No suckling pig. Sad face Â :-( We sat down anyway and proceeded to work our way through the general tapas menu. Most every dish we got was pretty good. Notably exceptional was the lamb albondigas and the spicy gambas. The tortilla was nice too. There weren't really any duds. Prices are reasonable for a SoHo joint - most dishes ranged between $7-10 with a few climbing into the $15+ range. I'd probably go back. 3.5 stars
"The burger is freakin' delicious, but I'd be lying if I told you I've ever eaten it while completely sober. It is what it is. Bonus points for having McSorley's light & dark on tap."
I went there for a late brunch. They serve eggs late during the day and during the week. Which is great. Food is good. Locally sourced products. Nice environment and good service.
"David Chang has referred to SsÃ¤m Bar as the place that most closely delivers his ideal dining experience. What originally began in 2006 as a burrito bar has made the transformation into one of the premier restaurants serving large-format meals for groups. While it's entirely possible to drop in on a whim and order a few small plates at the bar, coordinating a large-format meal is nothing short of an annoyance. It requires planning in advance and navigating Momofuku's platform to secure a spot, and a finalized headcount 24 hours prior. A pain, yes, but I was hopeful that it would be worth the hassle. Our group had reserved the Bo SsÃ¤m meal in advance, which features the signature pork shoulder. The restaurant also offers Rotisserie Duck and Dry Aged Rib Eye options as well, for those looking for alternative proteins, but the pork shoulder should be a go-to for any first time visitors. Once we were all seated, our server dropped by to give us a quick overview of the meal format and to address any questions we had. We started off with a tray of briney oysters, and our table was soon covered with a number of condiments and sides to complement the Bo SsÃ¤m. There's a basket of the Bibb lettuce, a bowl of white rice, and four sides/sauces: the addicting ginger-scallion, the sweet and spicy gochujang, the under-appreciated ssamjang (a spicy soybean paste), and the omnipresent cabbage kimchi. They're all meant to highlight the star of the show: the slow-roasted pork shoulder. The protein is cooked for upwards of 6 hours, then layered in a mixture of salt and brown sugar before being blasted at full heat. The result is a masterpiece of a protein; a tender, fall-apart interior with a few surprising pockets of fattiness, and a crisp, almost carmelized, crust. Breaking into it with a pair of tongs is a momentous event, but there's no need for pretense at a meal like this. There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to tackle a meal at SsÃ¤m Bar, but guests are advised to start with the Bibb lettuce as the base, pile on a scoop of rice, and then layer the pork shoulder and additional sauces to their liking. Wrapping it with the lettuce before biting ensures as minimal mess as possible, but there's bound to be some level of chaos as people reach for the different components and sides. Anywhere from 6 to 10 people are recommended for the Bo SsÃ¤m meal, and while larger parties might want to add on a few small plates, our group walked away with several to-go boxes. I give SsÃ¤m Bar three stars because while I did have a good meal, there's nothing particularly innovative or intricate about the food or the preparation required. It's simply a matter of time and having the equipment necessary to slow-roast a pork shoulder for hours. The price point isn't exactly wallet-friendly either, as one Bo SsÃ¤m meal is $225, exclusive of tax and tip. For those looking to accommodate a large party, Momofuku SsÃ¤m Bar is a viable option, but I don't foresee a return visit in the near future."
"By far, my favorite restaurant during my nine days in snowy NYC. Since Ootoya doesn't officially accept phone reservations for any times other than 6pm, one of us went in when they opened at 530pm, to request a table for 7pm: in essence, a reservation. Being seated about half an hour late, we eventually end up ordering: * Kaasanni - Delicious soggy fried chicken katsu. And while soggy isn't exactly an appetizing description, what this was was basically pieces of fried chicken topped with shredded radish, covered in a light broth. And while it could have done with a little less radish, it was all around still quite tasty, if you're able to accept the texture. * Oroshi Tonkatsu - This was another surprisingly tasty dish. Panko crust fried pork cutlet, surprising not because it was tasty, but because despite being thick cut, it was still quite moist and tender.cut * Gyu Shiokoji - A bit lackluster at first, I soon realized that the slices of beef weren't really meant to be eaten alone with the rice. When combined with the pickled veggies and a dash of wasabi, the flavor combination ended up being outstanding. * Rosu Katsu Ju - The least interesting portion of the meal, not because it wasn't tasty (because it was), but because it was basically their variation of sweet and sour pork. All these orders came as a set, which included a tasty bowl of miso soup, and an amazingly delicious cup of chawan mushi (another favorite item of mine in Japanese cuisine, and one which was done very, very well). ***Accessibility Info*** Venue - Contrary to what one might expect from the outside, the interior of Ootoya is actually incredibly spacious, and getting around or being seated isn't really an issue. Bathroom - Didn't try, so no comment."
"This food would put you in a coma. It's heavy and sinks to you bottom of you stomach like a rock (in a good way). The spot is fairly small but they know how to crank the people out. The chicken and rice is a tasty and moist dish, definitely something to eat for 2 days. I love the food but reduced a star because it's hard for me to pay high prices for food your family cooks on a daily basis."
"Not a fan. I got the catfish sandwich, which was small and overpriced. I was still hungry afterwards. It's different from your regular sandwich shop but I don't plan on going back again."
"Let's start with the positives: Luzzo's is pumping out some of the best Neapolitan-style thin-crust pizza pies in New York. Now that we've established this, the only thing that really discolored our experience was the inefficient reservation system. I picked Luzzo for dinner on Sunday night because they're one of the few craft pizza places that take reservations. These were surprisingly easy to make over the phone, same day, and a breeze to change to a half hour later when I called back. We walked in at 7 (rez time) and not seated until about 7:25. We watched several other parties, some of whom looked like walk-ins, move in ahead of us while we stood in the cramped little foyer/bar area (whose seats were occupied). The hostess apologized and said there was nothing she could do--there were several parties lingering. And, in fairness, she immediately offered us 3 glasses of prosecco, on the house, which was a stand-up move. So the hostess is great. I take issue with Luzzo having a reservation system in the first place. I bet this happens more often than you would think, and creates false expectations. It's a popular place, so maybe moving to a no-rez policy would make everyone's lives easier. Once we were seated, all was good. A hip bearded waiter who sounded Italiano took care of us. We started with some marinated artichokes (OK but a little out-of-the-can tasting). The bottle of Pino Nero was light-bodied and smooth, going down easy: if you like something with more tannins, stick with the chiantis/Sangiovese. They also brought over some tasty bread, though no olive oil. There was much rejoicing when the pizza arrived (one of the orders was wrong, but quickly rectified). We had the mushroom pie, the bufala, and for me, the Michele (mushrooms, prosciutto, mozzarella, and truffle pate, sans tomato sauce). All amazing, and I had a few slices for lunch today. Prices are definitely lofty, even on the ""small"" 12"" pies, but quality comes at a cost. So far I love everything Michele Luliano does with food. Luzzo's and Da Mikele are maybe the best pie factories in the city. Despite hiccups with the reservations, I ladle praise with pleasure."
"Healthful delicious eats - Great Bar for dining alone Delightful Interior - Casual or Dressy Okay When I'm within 20 blocks and I'm hungry + don't know what I'm in the mood for but want something healthy Red Cat is my go to spot. Great bar for dining alone or with friends. Have had plenty of meals here to be comfortable in saying EVERYTHING IS GOOD. Try a cocktail or two and feel free to chat up your neighbors - everyone here is friendly. Especially the awesome staff! Date Rating: 8 Pick up Scale: 8 Strong Suggestion: Come hungry. Good portion sizes + delicious drinks. Friendly to: #Paleo, #Vegetarian, #Carnivores"
"Best Greek food I've had in years, and I've had my fair share of Greek food! I went with a big group (12 or so) and we ordered A LOT of food! We pretty much tried everything on the menu which was just over the top delicious (we went a little crazy with our order). As for the rest of it, the space is beautiful with clay pots hanging from the ceiling and a very beach-y Mediterranean feel. Service is extremely friendly and personalized. Love it. Pylos, I'm so glad I found you."
"Great ambiance. Made a dinner reservation on Tuesday around 8PM. I'd recommend making a reservation since it was still pretty crowded. My friends and I decided to go crazy and go all out: appetizers, entrees, and a bottle of wine. For appetizers, I'd recommend the cheese platter and sample all 5 cheeses. For all adventurous eaters who love mysterious cheeses, this is a great treat. My favorite was a purple-ish colored cheese whose content I do not know. But it was creamy, sharp, and mysterious. For entrees, I ordered a few different vegetable dishes because my body was like, ""Hey let's take a break from meat burritos."" The beet salad appetizer and roasted cauliflower side were delicious. Great blend of tastes without being too overwhelming. Not heavy but a great light dinner for the summer. Great local eats for a night out with friends or a special date."
"My new favorite lunch spot! Delicious panini for only $5. I got the Milanese - chicken, pesto, and tomatoes. I originally asked for it without tomatoes, but the lovely Italian lady running the place told me to try it with tomatoes and if I didn't like it, she'd re-make it. It was AMAZING! I can't wait to go back!!"
"Can't eat it sober, regret it after eating it inebriated. You just can't win with these guys. =/ Here's my go to combo: Lamb and Chicken with 10 squirts white sauce, 5 squirts of BBQ sauce, and 1 squirt of hot sauce if I'm feeling lucky...punk. Skip the pita bread because beach season is coming and we're cutting carbs."
"I was unadventurous and had the wings and a beer. The wings were surprisingly big and tasty, very good value. Beer is beer."
"Awkward restaurant name. Check. Located on a divey street. Check. 10 feet wide, 50 feet long dining space. Check. Grandma at a corner table making dumplings by hand. Check. Soups and dumplings served in styrofoam. Check. Kitchen and wait staff yelling in Chinese at the top of their lungs. Check. Bottles of sriracha and soy/vinegar mixes adorning all tables. Check. Killer $3.00 plate of one dozen dumplings made by grandma... heaven. A total meal. I rest my case."
"Great food, awesome dÃ©cor, friendly enough staff. I only went once but loved it and will go back. Only had savory stuff (soup, open-faced sandwich), will definitely have to try that cookie!"
"I'm sorry, how have I not tried Sweet Afton until now?? What an awesome brunch spot! I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I've lived in the area for almost 2 years without knowing about Sweet Afton, but better late than never right? After listening to one of my girls rave about Sweet Afton's blueberry pancakes and fried pickles for weeks I knew this was a place I had to try, so last weekend we gathered the girls for brunch. I decided to have the GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH (on pullman loaf with Irish cheddar and Irish bacon, pickles and wholegrain mustard on the side) - Apparently ""pullman loaf"" is just a fancy way of saying sliced sandwich loaf bread, but Sweet Afton's bread is worth mentioning because it's thickly sliced and perfectly toasted. You can choose the type of cheese to go in your sandwich; I opted for the Irish cheddar to match the Irish bacon. The sandwich was SO GOOD! Just look at that cheese oozing out. It was perfectly balanced and it wasn't greasy at all, as is the problem with some grilled cheese sandwiches. I also really liked the grilled tomato, pickles, and wholegrain mustard they give on the side. They went really well with the sandwich and gave variety to each bite of sandwich. yelp.com/biz_photos/zgW7â€¦ The girls had... IRISH BREAKFAST ROLL (on country white bread with Irish sausage, Irish bacon, black pudding, organic fried egg) yelp.com/biz_photos/zgW7â€¦ FRESH BLUEBERRY PANCAKES (with maple syrup) yelp.com/biz_photos/zgW7â€¦ ORGANIC SCRAMBLED EGGS (served with pullman toast, grilled tomato) yelp.com/biz_photos/zgW7â€¦ Our group also shared a side of the BEER BATTERED FRIED MCCLURE'S PICKLES (with smokey sauce) - WOW I can see why my friend was raving about these pickles. They were so delicious that I wanted to gobble them all up without sharing. The sour pickles are sliced thickly so that the outer layer of fried dough doesn't overpower the pickle taste, and the smokey sauce was the perfect zesty compliment. Give me more! yelp.com/biz_photos/zgW7â€¦ I can see Sweet Afton becoming one of my favorite brunch spots in the area. They have a limited brunch menu, but we were all more than satisfied with what we ordered. Gather your friends for brunch at Sweet Afton and I promise you'll leave with full tummies, warmed hearts, and big smiles like we did."
"Great food, great prices, with great friends. I needed a place that was near Union Square, not too pricey, and good for groups and one of the results was De Andrea's. I'm a little skeptical about Italian because form past experience, it's either really good or really bad. I was just hoping that it was decent so I wouldn't be embarrassed in front of my friends. Luckily this place exceeded my expectation. First, half our party arrived really early, but the staff was very accommodating and seated us even though the other half wasn't go arrive for another 20 minutes. When everyone finally arrived, we finally got to ordering. We all decided to split Le Tigelle (prosciutto appetizer) and Cozze (mussels). The prosciutto was very interesting. The meat itself was pretty tasty and not dry, which often times happens. It was served with flat buns which hot to the touch and made for a delicious sandwich-like treat. The mussels were okay. Unfortunately, they weren't cleaned out too well and a couple of mine still had sand in them. However, the wine tomato sauce was amazing. We ended up asking for multiple baskets of bread to soak up the sauce, which is another reason why I loved this place. We ended up getting four baskets of bread and the servers never batted an eye. And the focaccia was so moist! For an entree, I got the Cavatelli. Italian restaurants are always just okay for me because pasta is just pasta. Da Andrea's was so good I had to write about it. First, the pasta was cooked perfectly, very chewy but still having substance. And another thing, the shrimp was also cooked perfectly! Normally, shrimp in pasta is overcooked and tough, but Da Andrea's shrimp was very tender and ""bouncy."" The salmon was also cooked well. Altogether with the pesto sauce and seafood, this made for a very hearty, tasty, and overall enjoyable dish! I came here on a whim and came out loving this place. It was a Monday night, but the place was packed with people, so I guess it's not a huge secret. Also, it didn't break the bank. I was more than satisfied and actually took home leftovers for under $20! Whether you're with a large group or looking for a place for an intimate date, Da Anrea's great for anything! Pros: attentive and courteous service, taste, quality of cooking/ingredients Dishes to try: Le Tigelle, Cozze, Cavatelli"
"You know how when you go into Chipotle you choose between a bowl, or tacos or a burrito...then you pick a meat...then you pick your add-ons? Â You do EXACTLY the same thing in Tres Carnes. Some of the ingredients are different but the concept, execution and vibe is the same. The brisket tacos and brisket bowl were good and the beer w/ hot sauce was interesting and if I'm in the area again I might go back."
"It was a disgustingly hot day so my roommates and I decided to get some cold soba noodles for dinner. We came here around 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table for 4. I ordered the roasted duck soba noodles (regular size), and my roommates got another one of the same, the tuna sashimi soba, and uni soba. We also ordered the pork belly for appetizer. The pork belly came fairly quickly and was yummy - flavorful, tender, and a sizable portion for $10. Our soba noodles took forever to arrive...we waited about 35-40 minutes from the time we ordered to when we finally received our food. The soba noodles were the perfect consistency, and the bowl with the soup, scallions, and roasted duck paired deliciously with it. They give you a pot of hot water to pour into the bowl once you're finished with the noodles so that you have a nice warm bowl of soup to enjoy, but I was so full after finishing my soba that I didn't drink much of it. The duck was a little bit too chewy, but well flavored. All in all, this place was good, but I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. I personally didn't think the wait (both to be seated and for our food to arrive) was worth it, and it was also pretty pricey. For my regular size order it was I think around $17. I will probably hunt around for some other soba/udon places to try."
"i've been here one other time for a company lunch during the holidays. my memory of it was okay. i'm always wary of dining out in huge groups if the restaurant doesn't specialize in 'family style' meals. anyway, came here with one person this second time and the experience was much better. the food wasn't anything too special. actually it was very simple BUT the quality was good and they did the basics well. we had 2 glasses of wine -mussles from the brasserie menu to start (unlike many places that douse the mussles with a lot of heavy flavors in an overwhelming amount of broth, this place really let the mussles shine. it was simple and delicious. note: i am a sucker for dipping toast in broth-heavy mussle dishes, but this was yum on its own) it came with fries! -i had the miso glazed organic salmon (the salmon was cooked well. perfect medium. but i didn't really taste the miso. came with sliced snap peas, mushroom and sweet pea puree. again, simple dish. elegant. not over seasoned. good quality) -he had the grilled prime hangar steak. (perfect medium rare with grilled asparagus, and sliced potato confit. that was probably the best and simplest asparagus dish i've had. not overcooked, still had the crunch on the inside but soft and smoky on the outside. the potatoes came with a sauce that had mustard in it. DELICIOUS.) -ended with banana walnut brownie with maple bourbon ice cream. the actual brownie and banana were okay. but the bourbon ice cream was amazing! also, great attentive and friendly service!"
"The service was ok and the food was good but there were a few disappointments. The first problem was that it was a humid day and their a/c vents were dripping on 3-4 of our group of 10, they offered to swab it but we chose to move people away from the drips rather than have someone wiping dust down on our table, to be honest, this wasn't such a big deal. The 2nd disappointment and this was the big one, and also the reason they lost 3 stars, my scallops, although cooked right were 30 dollars and came with 5 medium sized scallops, my dish should have been listed as an appetizer because the portion was 1/4 the size of any other entree at the table so it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you leave dinner with friends where you paid over $50 in food, drinks, and tip and need to grab a slice just to get home."
"when i can't be bothered to wait in that crazy ass line at ippudo... zutto is the next best thing for ramen AND happy to confirm, fresh sushi. Â their pork buns are not bad, but i would prefer ippudo's bar none. they have a much more interesting selection of ramen....pork, chicken, soy and even seafood... super delectable menu and my top two favorites are the spicy miso and seafood ramen, which is pork and seafood based, head on shrimp, manilla clams, roasted garlic oil, pickled ginger, menma, wakame... it's really good. the kimchi one is also good... has a little kick to it and it is topped off with tofu & clams. Â  the place is spectacular in space and it's never too busy filled with people. Â it's a great restaurant for large parties definitely. Â the menu is definitely overwhelming as there are things aside from ramen and sushi that you can choose from!!!"
"This place might be a dingy, hole in the wall, but the ramen is awesome. I got the shoyu and really enjoyed it. It's not too heavy but still has great flavor. I'd describe the soup here as tasting, ""homestyle."" It really taste homemade. It's not as heavy and rich as say, ippudo or santouka but it's an overall GREAT bowl of ramen. The gyoza here is also homemade and really good. YUMM."
"I still can't get over how happy I am that I dined here last night. I have not one single bad thing to say. The service was great, the staff was extremely nice, the place was big enough for a spot in greenwich and the food....oh the food. My friend and I split the sweet potato fries Â to start. Best SPF i've had ever. And i've had alot. they were in between baked and fried so I didnt feel bad eating them. They give you a cream based sauce to dip them in which I spruced up with srichacha sauce to make it into a chipotle mayo. YUM For dinner I got the vermicelli noodles with shrimp and vegetarian spring rolls. It was delicious. I am not an expert on vietnamese food because I've only had banh mi once but I am already planning dinner back here again next week. So satisfied and SOOOO cheap. I spent $11 total and was full for hours. Remember to bring cash!!!! Its a cash only establishment. ATM machine outside."
"Oh, where to start--first off, I'm glad I spent 25 minutes convincing my dad to wear a button-down shirt before going here. His typical ""shorts and tshrit"" only demeanor wouldn't have flown. Pretty upscale, moderately hip place. Absolutely beautiful inside. My usual standby for great Lebanese food is Tanoreen in Bay Ridge, which is outstanding--so naturally, that's the metric I used for Ilili. We all got the restaurant week menu, which was pretty extensive. Our waitress, Cher (I think), explained that everything was for sharing, mix and match, etc., which is typically how dining Middle Eastern works. Some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant, bar none. She was knowledgeable, attentive, and made plenty of suggestions. For appetizers, we decided we would each pick two (there were 3 of us) with no repeats, so we could taste everything. We got the hummus, falafel, fattoush, chankleesh, arnabeet mekle an the moussaka. The table was served fresh pita, which was excellent--clearly homemade, and hot right from the oven. Perfect texture, shape, size--and absolutely delicious! The hummus was alright--very basic, nothing special for this traditional Middle Eastern food. I sort of wished we had tried one of the flavors they offered, but whatever. Missed opportunity. The fattoush was also just okay--pretty much a salad with a light dressing and some pita chips. Again, nothing special. That was pretty much it for my ""meh"" complaints. The chankleesh was outstanding. Cher drizzled olive oil over it and broke it up. It was basically a small, layered dish of feta, onions, tomato and za'atar. It was...amazing. The feta wasn't too salty and was perfectly seasoned. the accompanying tomatoes were excellent. Ditto for the arnabeet mekle--perfectly fried cauliflower with some grated chili pepper on top. The tahini labne was awesome--the sesame paste flavor was a wonderful complement to the cauliflower. The falafel was a dressed-up version of the classic--they were cubes, not round patties, and were wonderful. There was a flavor in it i couldn't quite place, but I'm thinking soumac. Maybe. The last app was the moussaka, which was a far departure from the Greek version I was used to--cold, rich, and very flavorful. A clear winner. For dinner, we had the lamb shoulder, bass and the fatte (chickpea dish). The bass was cooked spectacularly well, with delicate, crispy outside. The sauteed peppers it was served in were amazing. I was blown away. The lamb shoulder was excellent, too, if a bit salty--it was almost like a lamb taco. You received a shredded bowl of lamb with a side of radishes, orange pieces, and bibb lettuce. I combined it in a pita with the minted whip--it was amazing. The whip complemented the saltiness for a delicious, delicious dish. For the fatte--perfectly-cooked chickpeas in a garlic-yogurt sauce with some pita chips made for a fairly light but delicious dish. Again, a winner. Dessert was some sort of chocolate cake with some whipped cream and chocolate mousse. I'm not normally a dessert person, but this was great. Total came to about $150, including 22% tip (and a beer) for three of us. A real winner. I want to give Ilili 5 stars, but the so-so hummus and fattoush make me go to 4. Sometimes, I wish yelp had half-stars so I could go 4.5. The real question, though, is would I go back not during restaurant week? Yes, in a heartbeat."
"Tucked away on Chrystie St this quaint brunch spot is an excellent local find in NYC. Everything from the location to the decor to the food itself is inspired. The taxidermy and flowers are adorable. We visited for brunch, the food was delicious and the cocktails are delightfully blended. I had the open faced egg white omelette which was cooked beautifully and my friend had the bacon and eggs, which is a generous portion. I'll definitely be back."
"Frank Bruni once asked if anyone could explain David Bouley. For all my propensity towards eerily accurate assessments of people, I could sadly do no better than he. Having just recently been to Brushstroke, M and I were excited to patronize another jewel of Mr. Bouley's empire. Not really part of the boozy brunch crowd, we opted for a weekend five course lunch. In a first for me, I decided to peruse the photos of the food on offer, and I must admit, the photographer/food stylists made each item look phenomenal. A bit lavish at times, but for the most part, the ingredients seemed to be given leeway to speak for themselves. I wondered if this approach would be extended in all facets of Bouley. Gaudy, in a quintessentially old-world French sort of way, the decor will ingratiate itself with some and incense others. Whatever rustic charms afforded to one by the bounty of apples in the foyer are quickly dissipated in the face of the gilded, well, everything, idyllic landscape paintings notwithstanding. The candelabra-esque sconces, festooned with glass orbs resembling jewels, the imposing centerpieces, and the musty bookcases engage in a fight to the death to determine what can be found most ostentatious. And yet, when taken as a whole, as your affably Alsatian waiter beams upon carving open the bread lined pot containing what will soon be your chicken, you cannot help but smile in return, and enjoy the unabashed pomp for what it is. Mr. Bouley has his tastes, as do we all; this is not a backlash against the growing trend of minimalism (his own Brushstroke is rather sparse), but rather an affirmation of an aesthetic he enjoys. What remained to be seen was if in his attention to the visual he had neglected his cooking. In a word, no. I began with a Big Eye Tuna Carpaccio, a dish described as prepared in a Mediterranean manner, and a dish that subsequently outshone its humble billing. A surprisingly delicate dill infused aioli served as a creamy foundation for the slices of kampachi, tuna, and amber jack as slivers of olive intermingled with the olive oil, providing a delightfully substantial brine for the proceedings. M's Smoked Salmon and Apple Blini were greater than the sum of their description as well. I worried that when combined with the still lingering aroma of apples from our entrance, the apple would be too much for the subtler ingredients. However, the white truffle honey managed to be just the earthy sweetness required to complement the salinity of the roe and the meatiness of the salmon. That interplay was merely a prelude to my next dish, the Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms. Treasure, in this case, was no exaggeration. In lightly grilling the toro, Mr. Bouley's whimsy and ingenuity were on full display, as the textures and savory flavors of each, now verging on interchangeability, were accented beautifully by the brightness of the sprouts and the gentle acidity of the cream foam. M would contest that her Porcini Flan, a heady melange of humble dashi, rich dungeness crab, and funky black truffle was just as worthy of the ""Treasure"" moniker. It was odd then, that the two following dishes, presented so lovingly, did not contain the same depth of flavor. My Roasted Long Island Duck did indeed evoke winter, and both the accompanying polenta and huckleberry puree tasted rather good, but the herb coulis did not taste as herbaceous as it looked, and felt a bit lost in the shuffle. M's Pennsylvania Chicken 'En Cocotte', as captured succinctly by the steam escaping its hay lined pot, seemed a little deflated on arrival. The chicken, while both moist and subtly smoky, rested on a bed of underwhelmingly average blue kale. That is not to say that either entree was bad: far from it. However, each had missteps in the form of extraneous additions keeping them from the heights of our earlier plates. Dessert, on the other hand, rose back to the previous peaks. Both the rhubarb and peach soups were stunningly light, an omage to the coming spring through fruits which would only now have begun to be planted. The icebergs of buckwheat gelato and amaretto ice cream that floated among them were two means to the same goal of full-bodied intricacy. My Varlhona Chocolate Souffle was an even more impactful lesson on intricacy, as chocolate's full spectrum of sweetness, bitterness, coarseness and silkiness were on display. Â M's Caramelized Anjou Pear was as cleverly deconstructed a tart as I've come across. The exceedingly generous mignardises seemed too plentiful to believe, and I genuinely believe that had we asked for more, we'd have been given them. That said, asking for more is unlikely, given the portions of the earlier dishes. Restaurants are generally too risky a venue from a subjectivity standpoint to make sweeping proclamations, but I have no qualms in guaranteeing that Bouley will satisfy. I may not be able to explain the man, eccentric and frustrating as he can be, but his food has been beyond reproach."
"Been coming here for more than a decade. This.place.is.my.jam. Seriously. I think because of the economy the hours have changed a little. They used to be open 24 hours but now they're open late, which is still good, especially for K Town, which is always poppin. I love coming here to get the Korean drinks that I usually drink in Asia. There's fruit inside! I also love getting the kimbap and other items from the refrigerated section of other Korean goodies. Rarely do I venture over to the hot food bar (my paying for food by the pound went away years ago!) but when I do I'm always satisfied. A great option in K Town if you don't want anything too fancy but want to sit down and chat where it's nice and clean."
"1 star? 2 stars? Yall trippin!! Cha-An has almost gotten Sevens Seven Star Stamp of Approval! Seriously, bring ya lady, 30-40$, and ya sweet tooth and thoroughly enjoy the excellence that is, the Chefs Dessert Sampler and pick out some fine tea to enjoy! Clean spot, good service, and the list goes on! This is for sure a must-hit spot! Cha-An....doin it PROPER!"
"Fancy pizza. That's the best way to describe this place. Â We recently came here for a coworker's birthday and were surprised by how great these pizzas looked in large metal trays. Â They do not sell pizza by the slice and they do not sell small pies. Â This is $21 per pie, 10 slices, thin crust goodness. Â We went with half a white pie and half an old fashioned. Â I preferred the old fashioned because the sauce is amazing. Â The white pie was also good. Â Both had a perfect thin crust and weren't heavy feeling. Â For a side, we all split an order of lasagna. Â I'm not the biggest lasagna fan but this was pretty good and also very light. Â For $3 each, you can get various toppings on any of the pizzas that they offer. Â Service here is fast and very friendly, as well as patient, especially since we could not decide what we wanted. Â Yes, the sodas are served in small bottles but they're just the right amount. Â This is definitely a place to visit if you want a sit down atmosphere but while eating pizza. Â They also have happy hour. Â Doesn't get much better than that."
"Very funky interior w/ flavorful food to match. Decided to stop in on a trip over to the new park by the Intrepid (aircraft carrier) and was surprised, as others have noted, how large of a place this was. It really is deceiving from the narrow storefront... As others have mentioned, service is a bit slow and the noise-level could be uncomfortable for some. Both are probably made worse on the main downstairs floor where gregarious groups gather. My wife and I instead had a 2-top on the balcony that overlooked the chaos. We shared a side of rice & beans w/ a main course of the eponymous ""Pio Chicken"". Perfectly juicy and a great portion to share. The semi-spicy green sauce on the side is a must. Come for the decor, stay for the food. Be warned that this restaurant is AMEX ONLY (or cash, of course) so plan accordingly."
"I could careless that I waited an hour for this meal, because it was well worth it. Â Best ramen in town. Â As the reviews state, yes you will be rushed in and out of the restaurant ,but it only seems fair to say that it houses only 20 seats and everyone would like to have some ramen too. Â So if you're extremely hungry and have a huge table top of more than 3 people accommodations for seating can be difficult. Â  I ordered the Mega Ramen, which was a Mega overload of pork. Â I guess I'm use to the ramen houses that slice and dice the pork into thinly sliced pieces. At Totto Ramen, you receive a huge slab. Â The ramen is fresh and the broth is very flavorful. Â It's a great experience and the servers are extremely nice. Â  If you are pushy and in a rush to get seated immediately, I would advise going elsewhere. Â Self entitlement won't get you the best seat in the house here. It's a first come first serve basis."
This place is a gem. It's byob which I absolutely love. Â Been here a couple times but my Â favorite is the veggie sandwich without a doubt. I'm a sucker for goat cheese. Also their soup of the days are always excellent. Their cauliflower soup = yummmm. Had the mushroom soup before too which is also delish. It has a home cooked feel to it. Only problem is that it really is like a nook and cranny so if you're going for brunch (which they do not take reservations for) Â get there early or you'll be waiting a while for seats!
"Hipsters face Williamsburg when they pray. Â Scrimping up money by tattooing out of mothers basement and selling rare vinyls, many make the pilgrimage to Roberta's donning their flannel that so often marks their faith in Hipster Jesus. Â Don't be fooled, whether you sport a mustache or not, all should have this Holy experience. Â This shrine to the slow food movement will leave you feeling enlightened. Â I would make recommendations but the menu changes more than lady Gaga's wardrobe, and it's sure to be as shocking."
"If you love meat and beer, this is the place for you! Our group ended up sitting in the back patio area under the heat lamps and were a little cold, however we quickly forgot about it once the spicy beef jerky arrived. Chewy and flavorful, these are something you don't want to miss! We ended up ordering a second portion once the first batch disappeared. Ordering family style, we shared the outstanding country pate, the lamb tartare, and the warm, comforting morcilla. These three were probably my favorites of the night. Meaty and full of flavor, these are dishes any carnivore or omnivore should try."
"I am a huge fan of this place. Â Brought my family here the other day after racking my brain for a good NY restaurant to share with the out-of-towners. Â They were both very impressed with my restaurant picking skillz. My go-to is the Kitchen Sink Salad. Â You get your choice of balls and sauce and it comes over a variety of Chef-selected vegetables which are always perfectly seasoned and delicious. Â Now that I am 100% gluten-free, I love that their chicken balls are gluten-free, but I highly recommend the spicy pork balls. Â All the sauces are delicious. Â I usually go with the standard tomato, but the mushroom is pretty damn good. The sides are a good size for sharing. Â The polenta is to die for. Â I also commend them on their spinach portions. Â We all know how much spinach cooks down and sometimes when I order a side of spinach at a restaurant it's almost laughable how small the portion ends up looking in the dish, but TMS definitely does not skimp on the portions. There's usually a wait whenever I go, but the bar is first-come, first-serve, and they can also text you when your table is ready. Â Epstein's bar next door is a great place to grab a drink while you wait as the bar at TMS is small and usually full of people eating delicious food and, let's be honest, who wants to stare at that on an empty stomach. Bottom line: Delicious meatballs. Nuff said."
"The poor man's version of Milos, Pylos has excellent food at a considerably cheaper price tag. Upon entering you'll be awed by the ceiling of terracotta pots suspended above - awe turning to anxiety at the thought of one of those clay pots crashing down on you. Out of litigious concern I hope those pots are actually strategically painted plastic vases... We started with the Diane's Light-as-air Meatballs, the Grilled Octopus, and the Haloumi Cheese. I think the meatballs are greatly overhyped, they're good but not mind-blowing, and there are much more interesting mezethe you can be sampling. I thought the Haloumi Cheese was awesome - Crispy, salty crust on the outside, creamy cheese on the inside, this was my favorite appetizer. In following the latest food fad of the moment, the Mediterranean diet is at the top of my list, so for my entree I picked the Grilled Whole Branzino. It was a fileted, deboned branzino grilled simply with olive oil and lemon and it was AMAZING. Those Greeks know their seafood. I joked that if we were in a Chinese household, we'd be fighting over the fish eyeball. No one wanted the eyeball. Dessert was the phyllo triangles with custard / pistachios - kind of a glorified baklava filling with a spanakopita crust. Service was great, and the restaurant let us linger there for a long leisurely meal. It wasn't until we noticed the kitchen staff having their meal for the evening that we finally sheepishly departed."
"Once inside and downstairs, the restaurant is quite big with a long seated bar section. The place is sufficiently popular for dinner that you may be in for a reasonably long wait, anything from an hour to two without a reservation. The food here is really good value for money. The quality of the produce is excellent and they have a series of accompanying sake that are well worth tasting. We had a bunch of fried things, including chicken, pork and shrimp balls wrapped in almonds. All were delightful but what really stole the show was the house speciality, a piece of pork belly in a wonderfully tasty broth. An absolute delight. Since you do need some vegetable, the eggplant is a must. Cooked perfectly, it comes in three two bite portions, each coated with in a different seasoning, a pleasure for anyone who likes eggplant."
"Fun, laid back atmosphere with plenty of room to sit, although it does get crowded quickly on weekends. Get a few things to try, but make sure you prioritize the moist (fatty) BRISKET. Go light on the pork belly. Side dishes are fantastic--I thought the collards were particularly good, but the beans and mac n cheese were great too. Key Lime Pie dessert was disappointing. Great beer selection. Will be back for more."
mmmm...crack-on-a-stick cheesy smokey corn on the cob!! Need i say more??
"Love this place! When I first moved here this was the first place I ate. Had it again last night (albeit in a much more intoxicated state) and it was so delish! Their pizza is super thin crust so you can eat a lot of it. We ordered 3 pizzas, of which my favorite was the bufala - simple, yet delivered in style. We also ordered a plate of fried apps. Really tasty, but in all fairness it's hard to screw up fried food. Their pizza has to rank among the best in the East Village. Not sure about all of NY, but definitely the best over a large area of avenues/blocks. You just can't go wrong with this place. Eat here. You'll probably see me in the corner scarfing down some Bufala slices."
"My biggie bought me here for lunch and it was delicious! I ordered a burger and a mint chocolate chip shake. Both was amazing! I had my burger medium rare and that's how they gave it to me. It's rare that I finish a burger but I finished it! Which has to mean it was delicious. He originally wanted to take me here for their pancakes but turns out they only served them till a certain time and we came too late for them. The atmosphere was cozy. The lighting was on the darker side even though we came during lunch hours so I feel like this is more of a romantic restaurant. So yes, it's a good place to bring your date to. The only problem I had with this place was that our table was soooooo small.. It was 3 of us and they sat us on a square table. We didn't even have enough room to put all our food on the table. Usually I like to keep my phone on the table also but no room to put it anywhere. The restaurant was packed either, there were many free tables so I don't know why they sat 3 people on a table that clearly was meant for 2. Regardless I would come back since the food was good!"
"Love it. Â Not sure what to add that other's haven't said already. Â  It is a little chaotic but once you kinda get the feel for it, it's a great experience. Â The best thing to do is buy a big glass of wine as soon as you walk in the door. Â Then you can just walk around and explore the offerings around the store. Â It's fun looking at all of the different olive oil options or some of the different foodie books. Â When your glass is near empty, grab a seat near the cheeses and get a cheese plate and/or an appetizer. Â Grab a bottle with your friends to sample a good variety of cheeses and meats. Â This is where I discovered that the combination of goat cheese and fig spread on a cracker is better than fucking peanut butter and jelly. Â This is no joke. Â It is good. Â When your mind is sufficiently blown, have your glass refilled with the rest of your wine and meander on out. Â You'll pass the chocolate and/or the ice cream stop on your way out the door. If you start your night early, this is a great first stop on a fun date."
I had lunch here recently. Excellent tacos but I'll have to come back a few times for me to really compare them with my other favorites. The restaurant itself is simple and casual and the menu does seem to be fairly authentic. Reasonable prices as well. I just wished the service was more attentive. They got my order wrong but at least at what they gave me (fish tacos instead of the cabeza) was also good.
"Forget about this place, it's high rating based on it's history. There are only sad, tired and grim old waiters now, and the food is pretty sad too in this atmosphere. They have the new spot on Mott st now, with old cool cook and awesome food and friendly service!"
"They call it intimate - I call it cramped They call it small plates - I call it small portions They call it wow! - I ask HOW!?! May be I am biased - but I found this place to be overhyped- and hype is the only reason, it attracts such great crowd ~ which is probably the best part about this place. I found the food to be just meh! When I order a pesto di noci, I expect something that tastes like basil - or look remotely green? Expecting too much? Well, it wasn't even close to what I expected. The vino brÃ»lÃ© I ordered won't qualify as my favorite drink either. The bread had butter oozing out of it - in proportions that I don't fancy! I did like the selection of fromage, though. Short list but flavors were sharp. Eventually, it's all about the food and I thought it didn't quite match up. P.S. I did NOT click any pictures - because the small-plates-place does not give you enough elbow room to even slice your bread. Clicking a picture is way out of question."
"Small, very tight, setting in the LES that feels very Japanese. No racial. Â  Service: Average. Food: Had just about every ramen on the menu. Have always been satisfied and never feel too bloated after. I'm not sure there's msg in there but if there is, they don't o.d. on it like most places. Their broth is the star, which is as good and maybe better then Toto Ramen but in a lighter way, if that makes sense. Â The nOodles are always perfect. The pork belly is flavorful and melts in your mouth tender. Oh the gyoza is good too. Cons: Tight seating. I hate tight. Well, in terms of seating anyway... there might be a slight wait, but that's typical of great ramen joints and you'll never wait as long as you do at Toto Ramen. For now anyway. It's worthy of your time in line. Â  Overall: My go-to ramen joint. Â If I could take Toto Ramen without it's annoying weight and blend it with what these guys do well, I'd Never go anywhere else. The price can't be beat with the quality you are receiving."
"Eh. The food's ok, but the decor and music are awesome. Its sister restaurant Maharlika has better food, but the vibe at Jeepney is better. Here's the lowdown: 1. Food: pass on the chicken wings. They were bland, despite the promise of banana ketchup. Ordered the Bicol Express and the Pancit Malabak Negra (about $17 per entree). The pork shoulder was tender, but the combination of sauce and the batter exterior soon became mushy. The Pancit black squid noodles were also disappointing. The noodles were rather short, choppy, and undercooked, but the taste was interesting. 2. Atmosphere: the decor is fun! It accounted for the entirety of the two stars. Jeepneys are privately-owned jeep style buses in the Philippines that are decorated cheerfully and flamboyantly. You can see the influence in the decor here: the walls are made of some tin-based metal, and covered with nostalgic prints and cutouts, and some bare-naked ladies. Music: old-school 90s and early 2000s pop and hip hop. 3. Service: great, if stretched a bit thin."
"TUESDAYS are the only day for half off tapas during happy hour! otherwise happy hour drinks are offered 1-8 pm Mon-Fri, a lot of hours! one plate of tapas was big enough to be a meal for me esp since we shared guacamole & chips as an appetizer taquitos are acutally tacos & come w/ 3 meaty tacos! ---guacamole: comes as a duo of guac & salsa, cant go wrong. If you're lucky you'll get fried plantain and taro chips mixed in w/ the tortilla chips ---platano relleno: liked the crispy texture on the outside of the plantain & the balance of the salty pork ---churrasquinos: grilled skirt steak skewers MMm these were cooked well! ---quesadilla camarones: yummy and the quesadillas were actually toasty ---mussels: really fishy tasting SKIP ---calamari: SKIP, stick with the more ethnic dishes ---tres leches: Mmm I like the hint of passion fruit Drinks are strong b/c Sergio who runs the show would never want you to complain that their drinks are weak! Love the philosophy & the staff here including Carlos the bartender! ---yuca sunrise cocktail: frozen marg + sangria.. good but the alcohol really CREEPS up on you! ---frozen mojito: $6 during happy hour, again another creeper. Theytaste so good though NOTE: the big round table in the back fit our large group of 7 but we got there early at 530 pm.. the place was packed by the time we left.. & there's a 2 hour limit on seating PLUS: they allowed us to use as many credit cards as we needed to split the bill SO NICE"
"So I went here with friends for brunch and I must say that this place did not disappoint! Â The food was excellent. Â It was so good I could not decide on what I wanted so I got two things: Â the mussels are to die for. The broth was full of flavor and the mussels was cooked perfectly. Â The only thing I wished was that they added a piece of bread with your order. It's does come with fries (which are also very good) and j did dunk a few in the sauce but I think that a slice of bread would put this over the top. I also had the madame croquet (sp? ) and that was soooooooooooo good. The bread was perfectly buttered and toasted, the egg was cooked to perfection. Â Go to this place you Wil not be disappointed"
I tried this place bc i love vive la crepe 2 stores down. pretty gangsta for this owner to open one up right by it. crepes are about $1 give or take cheaper. i didn't like it. it was cold and not that great where vive's crepes are warm and delicious. not as much fruit in it and was left unsatisfied. went back to vive a month later and fulfilled my crepe craving!
"i heard alot about this place so i actually tempered my expectations to be a little disappointed... boy, was i wrong! it was fantastic- i tried the margarita and their namesake, the spinach and artichoke and both were amazing. Â the crust was so nice and crisp, and not too thick but not too thin either. Â the margarita had a great balance of cheese and sauce, while the spinach artichoke- well, it tasted like a really good spinach artichoke dip slathered on a great crust. Â  yes, there is no seating and we did wait in line, though not for too long (10 mins)- but once in a while, it doesn't matter- especially when you get a great meal for $8! definitely check it out."
Love this place. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is attentive but not overbearing. You need the warm Brie drizzled with honey to start and I highly recommend the scallops.
"Best sliders in town, and at $2-2.50 a pop, you cant go wrong! The bun is perfectly toasted and the meat is freshly ground. The fries and chili are good as well. For an extra $.25 you can get pickles!! The other great thing about this place is the sauces they give you. On your table they give you kethcup, chipotle kethcup, jalapeno sauce, bbq. My favorite are the chipotle ketchup and jalapeno sauce! The burger is great itself, does not need any sauces but if you want to add kick to your slider or fries, try the sauces. For drinks they have beer selections and also GUINNESS MILKSHAKES. Yes, they really do and they are very very tasty!! Place is open late and usually never has a wait. Definitely one of NY's best kept secrets."
"Brought here by my fiancÃ© for my birthday and I thought it was amazing, from the atmosphere to the food. Â Bobby Flay is literally working the line and making rounds in the dining room. Â Highly recommend!!"
Charming and cozy little place with a terrific selection of cheeses to accompany lots of Italian wines. They don't carry everyday staples like Chardonnay but describe your taste and attentive waiters will pair you with something that will get you jolly. Fantastic!
"4 1/2 stars. God freaking dam. Upstate, you really are a hidden gem in the East Village. After me and my date tried to get a table there, the guy kindly told us it would be 45-60 minute wait. Of course, we were too hungry so we decided to look for another place to eat while sitting down at the bench next to it. 5 minutes later, the guy comes out, sees us and offers us 2 spots at the bar since a party just left. Perfect. 7:01, we ask if happy hour deal is still on. Boom. We get the last batch. Blue points were whatever but their other oysters, which the owner told us that they were farm raised by a long time local, were delicious. Beer selections were phenomenal too unlike the PBR at Fish. We then opted for the Fettuccine with clams. Wow. It had plenty amount of clams in one bowl, pasta was done al dente, and the garlic and evoo were perfectly balanced to make this dish amazing. I'd highly recommend. The whiskey cake was just as good as everybody else said it was. Really moist and had a hint of whiskey flavor. Yum. I'd definitely return in the near future. Go."
"My new favorite BBQ place. We got here around 4:30 during the weekend, and there already was a long line but plenty of seats. Highly recommend the brisket and burnt ends. Sweet potato casserole was delectable, and cole slaw is great for cutting through the smokiness of the BBQ. I might opt for the sandwich option next time because it's A LOT of meat. They also have Pomme Frite's fries, but the boys decided to get cole slaw for us instead. Great prices and value. Will definitely be back."
"Solid 3.5 stars. Pretty good Cuban food, but overpriced for a place all the way out on Ave C that doesn't even have a website. I had the Pollo Cafecito, which the server said was their signature dish. I do have to say the chicken was perfectly cooked and tasty, but it was only lightly spiced and I found myself wishing there was some sort of sauce or salsa to complement it. Also, which Cuban place doesn't at least have the famous Cuban green sauce available?! Even Sophie's has bottles of that on every table! On the plus side, the ""maduros"" or fried plantains served with the dish were excellent as were the black beans, although they could have used a tad bit more salt. My friend had the Playa Varadaro, a vegetarian platter with boniato (sweet potato) hash, fried balls that resembled hush puppies, and avocado slices. This was absolutely DELICIOUS. Light and refreshing - perfect for a hot summer day. We also indulged in a couple of mango margaritas & pineapple daiquiris. These were pretty good - strong and surprisingly well priced at $8. We used a ScoutMob deal that gave us $10 off, but they also charged us an automatic 18% gratuity because of it. Would have gladly tipped that much regardless, but the service was pretty sporadic. Overall, fine if you're in the area, but not worth the trek all the way out there."
"Came here Saturday night after Christmas holidays and found the place to be filled with people, but not packed. We were able to get a table for 2 easily. The decor is festive and filled with images of different places of Latin America. Â Service was great: waiters are floating around and were quick to answer or assist us. We ordered their specials of lobster quesadilla and duck empanada, as well as the Columbian Platter with Columbia chorizo. Â We were not fans of the lobster quesadilla or the duck empanada - possibly because the flavors were more experimental than we were expecting. However, the Columbia Platter was delicious! The meats were great and topped with rice, fried egg, and plantains. There's a perfectly cooked med-rare steak, crispy pork and we added an extra Columbia chorizo which was perfectly cooked. So, so good! Will definitely come back for that."
"This review is for Kiwiana's private party services. My sisters had originally considered Kiwiana for my baby shower. Unfortunately, their staff were very restrictive - no decor, etc. - and they were rude to work with. So, even though I'd really wanted to try their food, we ended up going with a friendlier venue that allowed them to bring a few personal touches to the party."
"Came here for brunch about two weeks ago and was happy with everything initially. Positives: The food here is amazing. We ordered the unlimited brunch for four and loved everything about our dishes. I believe we ordered a pizza, two brunch plates, and two sides. Another thing I liked about this place was the dÃ©cor and space, definitely a plus. Negatives: The unlimited brunch is 90 mins which is normal for a lot of places. What isn't normal is the fact that our waitress came around only twice to refill our drinks; the first time we had to ask. Had we known that would be the case, we would've ordered our own carafes (which were $10 less and are good for three refills). Â We also wanted to order dessert, but that never happened. She ended up bringing our check over without even giving us a 15 min heads up. We then told her we wanted dessert and she proceeded to tell us that we could order it at the bar...which was packed. Overall, I'd say the experience is positive. Just keep tabs on the timing because they won't remind you and make sure your waiter/waitress is attentive if you order the unlimited option."
"You must get the vanilla bean french toast if you go here- it is absolutely amazing. It's kind of like having creme brulee for breakfast and the portion is huge too. If you can, I recommend ordering the french toast and sharing it with someone so that you can have something sweet and something savory. I think it might be overkill to eat the entire portion of the french toast seeing as it's gigantic. I also had the open faced omelet which had gruyere, bacon and potatoes. It was good but definitely more like a fritatta since the eggs were well done. It's quite heavy but still very tasty. It reminds me of baked potato skins because the potato in it is small slices with the skin on. The service was rather spotty but it didn't bother me much because I was busy scarfing the food down. I had to ask for water and coffee re-fills and they just weren't very attentive. It seemed as if the restaurant was full of patrons but there weren't a lot of servers to be found. The food was pretty solid though so I'll probably be back to try lunch or dinner."
"Fantastic! Â Nothing was just mediocre; literally every single thing was fantastic. Â I tried the duck banh mi, three cheeses, chicken liver pate, homemade pretzels, quail egg toast, and seared flank steak (cooked perfectly). Â All amazing. Â Portions aren't large but it was enough for a few of us to share everything and walk out full. Â Service was wonderful and they have a great wine selection, and a decent beer selection too! Â They had my favorite beer on tap - Palm. Â  I had made a reservation for 6 of us on a Tuesday night and it didn't even seem necessary, though it got comfortably crowded. Â We sat in the lounge area and it was like our own private party. Â Very lovely place, I will absolutely be back."
"If you want boring old-fashioned food served to you in an upscale TGI-Fridays atmosphere, eat dinner at Rye. The staff are friendly, but the fake old-timey schtick is about as fresh as the Yo Ho Ho song on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the food is heavy and boring. It's just meat and butter on top of meat and some buttery vegetables. However, the bartender was very knowledgable and made some very stiff, interesting cocktails based on a conversation about what I was looking for. I'd stop in again for a drink or three, but I wouldn't bother with the food."
"As a frequent patron of Wafa's for many years at the older location as well as the new one i had to express my disappointment. I ordered the lamb shawarma sandwich along with an order of hand cut fries and the moment I got there to pick up my order the hostess/waitress (laura/lisa) greeted the individuals behind me. I was standing there and another waiter told me to not stand near a table and I was there in limbo waiting for my food and being ignored. Eventually laura/lisa, told me my food is ready even though the bag was sitting there since my arrival. Then I was scolded about me paying with a credit card for my meal that cost 14.70 and not meeting their 15.00 dollar credit card minimum?!!! Are you serious? Upon arriving home the food was cold and the fries were incredibly soggy. I must admit the sandwich wasn't great it was barely edible as the lamb was incredibly chewy... I ordered a chicken shawarma last time which wasn't great either. The prices are outrageous!!! 9.50 for a lamb sandwich and 4.00 for soggy fries are you kidding me? Yes there are not many good middle eastern places around the area... but if you drive take the 10-15 minute drive to astoria there is plenty of great Moroccan, lebanese, Egyptian and algerian food for half the price and same authenticity. Wafa is a tremendous person as I have met her many times and she's always the main chef in her kitchen ... but I am sorry I will not be a patron here anymore."
"came here on a Saturday night. no reservations. it was a 45 minute wait so we headed for the bar. i recommend making reservations if you would rather skip the drink at the bar. the place was very crowded as expected for saturday night. and very loud. we ordered some beers and a cocktail. i had a sonata no.8 - the one with sparkling wine, apple and cinnamon. it was pretty good.. then we ordered some calamari and a flatbread... because you cant go wrong with those... but i was wrong. everything was too dry. and little pricey for 13/14 dollar appetizers. that werent even that good. but the service was good. the bartenders were quick and helpful. maybe i would come back to try dinner.... and from the reviews it seems they serve sparkling water"
"Food here is a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds. Â Portions are tiny but if you sip your sake and nibble in a leisurely manner, eventually you'll feel full. Â Remember, it takes ~20 minutes for your brain to register satiety so just think you're doing your health (and your wallet) a favor by appreciating food slowly Â :p I also love the miniature tumblers they use as ochoko. Â They Â look like a mini version of Riedel O glasses and are adorable. Â Quality sake deserves to be served elegantly. Â Note to self: ask where I can get a set of these next time I go. Â  Some of my favorite dishes here are: jidori shioyaki, nasu dengaku, and shiromi nanban (correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't seen this dish in any other izakaya around here). Â I've never tried dessert here because whenever I eat out, I try to order alcohol or dessert, but never both in a meager attempt to cut down on calories. Â But if your metabolism is sky high, please do try the pear mille feuille for me and tell me how it is."
"I went to Brooklyn Commune with a friend for brunch, service was really lacking. We first sat at the window and no one came for about 10 minutes. A table opened up so we sat down and were served. We waited with empty plates and glasses for almost 20 minutes before we got up and settled at the counter. We were never offered water or a refill the entire time. My friend got the cheese grits which she liked but personally I didn't enjoy. I found it strangely seasoned though I'm partial to only salt in mine. She also got a side of bacon which was fine. I got a ham & brie croissant which was underwhelming. It was slightly warm but not really and had a side salad thrown in it. The croissant Â was just kind of bleh, something I would expect from a cheap street cart."
"LOVED my experience at The Market Table. First off, the hostess was a total doll. I had to keep delaying my reservation because my boyfriend was stuck at work and she was accommodating and sweet. So refreshing compared to most hostesses in NYC. For appetizer, we shared the mussels with cavatelli and the softshell crab. They split the mussels for us into two plates- I love when restaurants do that. My boyfriend is a very fast eater so the fact that I was able to claim my territory and have my half of the appetizer in peace was a nice touch :) Both appetizers were very delicious and had lots of fresh veggies that accompanied both. This is something unique about Market Table. I love the variety of sides that come with each dish. For entree I had the sea bream and my boyfriend had the steak. We both really enjoyed them. I would definitely come back and try other things on the menu!"
Not as tasty as my first visit.
Steamed Eggs! Yes PLS My 1st time ever indulging this wonderful concept! I LOVE Buvette is so Charming not to the desserts you must try the mousse well to be honest everything is Wonderful! :)
"The hostess was really nice and even though there was an almost two hour wait, she told us to go have drinks some place else (their bar was packed), and call her when we were heading back to get an update on the table situation. Once we were seated, the gracious service stopped there. The waitress had NO personality. The atmosphere, overall is lacking. The place is super small, and so it is totally CRAMPED. Like sitting an inch away from other people cramped. Unfortunately, our party of 4 was sat in the middle of the room, right outside the bathroom. Now, that's uncomfortable for the obvious reasons (like the horrid smell after someone dropped a bomb!), but because there's only one unisex bathroom, quite the line forms. At one point, we counted 8 people standing around our table, very closely, waiting for the bathroom. Taking all that into consideration, the food here really was quite good, though. We ordered the shrimp and grits, fried chicken (SO good with the hot sauce), and the homemade french onion dip and chips."
"The drinks here are amazing. Â I chose what I wanted and my drink turned out to be exactly how I imagined it. Â All I said was ""vodka, lemon, basil"" and he came back with a delicious cocktail for me. Â The mixologists here are amazing. Â Great service, very attentive and friendly. This place does get very packed, but we were lucky to find a small spot at the bar. Â I would definitely recommend and bring friends here."
"** Downhill Alert ** My recent experience at Katsu-Hama is how I imagine my 10 year high school reunion will play out. Chris (Grade 10): Â *Dreamily doodles sweet nothings about that girl from the Volleyball team on graph paper during Trig class* Chris (10 yr Reunion): Â Oh look, volleyball girl put on 50 pounds. Â Two kids'll do that to yah. Â -_-; My first several visits to Katsu-Hama elicited the fan-boyism that I usually only reserve for the latest trendy speakeasy (or banh mi dive) In a mad lib of bragging to friends and co-workers I might gush, ""(Gender Neutral Greeting)! Â I just (Ate/Drank) at this (Superlative) new (Restaurant/Speakeasy/Banh Mi restaurant/Katsu Join)! Â It was so (Expletive) good!"" Needless to say, I *WAS* a fan at one point. Â I'd drag co-workers, acquaintances, and any willing ear, and point out how cool it was to grind your own sesame seeds for the sauce, or professionally opine on the superiority of the panko breading of the katsu. I let a year or so lapse, and i've gotten wiser and more jaded towards the NY dining scene. Â So my recent return was with high expectations, and an underwhelming delivery. Â  It's hard to pin my sub-par experience on any single deliverable. Â Was it the watered down sochu cocktail? Â Maybe. Â The fact that my beer wasn't topped off? Perhaps. Â The slow service? Â Yeah, that could be it. Â The formerly majestic katsu, now a remnant of its former self, slightly soggy and greasy, stale and mushy? Â Definitely. Now that i've facedbook'ed all of my highschool classmates there's really no need to go back for a reunion. Â I know who got fat, who got married, and who got hot. Â Similarly, now that folks can Yelp Katsu-Hama, there's really no reason to pay it a visit."
"I really want to like this place. I've gone for dinner twice. The food is just forgettable to disappointing; oyster po' boy was soggy (both the bread roll and the fried oyster breading). Ã‰touffÃ©e wasn't delightful, but it was edible. Tasted heavily like commercial bouillon or Cajun in a box, like Zatarain's. Crystal hot sauce on the table is a nice authentic touch, but it can't make the food taste like it was prepared with care. They might suffer from being a southern theme restaurant in the northeast and having way too many options on the menu--po' boys, seafood boils, AND jambalaya? Unlikely to make all three specialities perfect in one restaurant. The pricing is at hip cool guy level for food that did not warrant the expense."
"I found this place when i was craving for dumplings and since it was near my school it was a great spot. Although the place was small, there was enough room for everyone. I ordered the boiled dumplings, the fried dumplings and the sha cha beef noodle soup. I didn't expect the boiled dumplings to taste that good but it was amazing. It even tasted better than the fried ones and ironically the fried ones were really golden. The sha cha beef noodle soup was smaller than i expected but it kept me full. It was pretty good and the beef was fresh however it is pretty spicy so if you can't handle spice don't try it. Overall, a great find."
"Now, I love empanadas. All the way from my momma's kitchen and onto my plate is what I look for when I try them from restaurants. If you have too much dough to meat ratio, or too much (gasp) oil or grease in your empanada or your meat is dry, honey, you're not doing it right!!! Puerto Viejo, you got something going on here. The empanadas were delicious, the sangria was just what I needed after 5pm and the pulled pork was yummy and the portions were enormous! You could totally split one entree with your date if you also order appetizers and drink the night away. Take my credit card, and I'll order from you WAY more. Please and thank you? :) (Currently cash only and no hard liquor)"
"The name's really weird. But the food here never fails to hit the spot, and is very reasonably priced. A Korean lunchbox and a salad or soup costs about 6.00 with tax. They also have a buffet option, but I think it's priced by weight, so be careful. Also open until 3 am!"
Yelp you fooled me! Photos of cute desserts brought me to this place... But taste of the desserts is below par..... Service: Waitresses were not friendly and looked like they don't enjoy their jobs. Food: Ordered the Chef's Dessert Assortment. Got a really really tiny piece of sorbet. The cake was bland and really dry... macaroon wasn't up to par. The tea wasn't bad but still pricey. Price: Expensive for crappy food... Overall: Take your money somewhere else.
"I swear there's crack in the cheese. By far the best pizza I've had. They always have a line at the window so fresh pies are being brought out every couple minutes. I always go for the center pieces as the side and corners tend to have a little too much crust for me. Pro tip: when they bring out a new pie, watch the guy cutting it. They usually just use regular knives to cut the pizzas and sometimes the pieces come out uneven...ask for the bigger ones of course. I've only had the pizza here, but plan to try the ice cream and italian ice sometime soon. I hear they're bomb as well."
"oh yumminess. Â there is a reason why this is so highly rated. Â the layout of the restaurant gives off a high-end chillaxing aura, if that makes any sense. Â the decor is very relaxing and its somewhere i would want to linger for a while, if it weren't for the people i knew are waiting for their chance to sit down. Â some of the tables over look the street and there was a wonderful breeze that came in and kept the sheer curtains softly swaying in the background that were nicely illuminated by the skylights. Â  the staff is super friendly and do their best to accommodate you even with the numerous amounts of visitors. Â the host/hostess were super nice and i was personally escorted to the bathroom by the very sweet looking host. Â someone else did mention that there were lots of good looking people which was definitely true, but its not somewhere i would feel awkward in. Â  the brunch menu is delicious., although my venison burger was a bit dry, that would be my only minus. Â its much more of a slider than a burger and couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 bites. Â my friends got the salmon, the waffles, and the turkish eggs, all of which were delicious and mostly completely devoured. Â  i cannot wait to come back and check out the dinner. Â i cannot wait to try the kangaroo."
"FOOD: we came here since it was featured in a few magazines and everyone raved about this place. we ordered the brisket sandwich. Â it looked amazing. the brisket itself was on the dry side, which was a huge disappointment. Â we had to drench it in bbq sauce. Â the bbq sauce was good. Â it was on the sweeter side. Â another disappointing thing about this sandwich was the bun. Â even though our bun came from a fresh batch, it wasn't very soft. Â we weren't fans. SERVICE: Â okay. Â there was a long line when we came here but the staff did a decent job getting people through quickly. AMBIENCE: Â really cool place. Â dark interior (dark woods) but lots of windows. Â we went for the outdoor seats since it was a beautiful day outside. OVERALL: Â we wanted to love this place but it was a let down. Â we didn't love our sandwich... the brisket just fell short. Â maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?!"
"I am drooling thinking about this restaurant as I write and wishing that I lived closer so that I could go here daily. Although the place was packed, they took us right away and seated us and were quite friendly and attentive. I ordered Tom Yum Shrimp Soup. It has quite a kick to it and is ""secretly spicy."" It's the best I've ever had throughout the world. Lots of good vegetables and shrimp in there. The Chicken Soup was smooth and slightly sweet with huge chunks of chicken. For the entree, I ordered the yellow Karee curry and it was TO DIE FOR! It came with a sweet cucumber salad. I ordered some coconut rice, put the curried vegetables and chicken over it and then the cucumber salad on top. What an incredible mixture of tastes. I WANT MORE! Dessert was very hard to choose from as most of it was non-dairy (I am lactose intolerant). I ordered coconut on top of grass jelly and everyone at the table was fighting for it. I can't wait to go back! This is now one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! FYI it is CASH ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Loved this place. Ordered the grilled octopus, grilled whole fish and vegetarian moussaka. Â Looking forward to going back."
"I've gone to Traif many times but I'm finally getting a chance to write a review. Â Food here is absolutely delicious, Â can't go wrong with any dish you pick. Â My favorites are the BBQ Braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli and Seared Foie Gras with Yukon potatoes, bacon, sunny egg, and topped with hot sauce and maple. Â Finally, Â I've just been stuck on one dessert and haven't really tried anything else. All you need to know is Bacon Doughnuts with coffee ice cream!! Â Bacon.. Doughnuts.. Coffee Ice cream.. Can't ever go wrong!!"
"Friend hosted her baby shower here on Saturday afternoon. Awesome private space in the back and the food was really delicious. I had the fried artichoke heart for appetizer with lemon. It was delicious! perfectly fried with crunchy outside (not burnt but looked it) and tender moist leaves. You get a wedge of lemon and can squeeze as much juice (or as little) as you want on it. IMHO it made the dish complete. Â  Then had the pork belly pasta. Hand made pasta - Pappardelle style... not a big portion, but with the potatoes (perfectly seasoned with crunchy exterior and soft inside) and escarole sides, plenty of food to fill me up. Got the croissant chocolate bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream. I understand that this may reduce the moistness that people look for in bread pudding...but I wish I could have tasted the croissant-ness a bit more. Â  Don't know the price of the meal so 4 stars based on food."
"Noodles are clean (not over cooked, not undercooked, made in house, fresh, didn't need extra ingredients), yummy, the veggies are fresh, and the place is just simple good food. Unlike ramen where it gets dirty inside of ramen, overwhelming smell of buttered noodles with tons of oil and extra toppings..thie place was more relaxing with good service and straight forward menu with the sizes done by grams."
"I'm a big Top Chef fan so coming to Harold Dieterle's restaurant was a big treat for me. Came here with one other friend and everything was on point. There's a reason he won the first season of Top Chef!! We ordered: -Spicy Duck Meatballs -Roasted Brussel Sprout Leaves (this doesn't sound that appetizing but definitely worth geting. Don't let the inner child in you be turned off by the sound of brussel sprouts) -Grilled Branzino -Roasted Duck Breast (star of the night- still recommend getting a variety of dishes so you can try everything, but try to be the one that orders this entree) -Dark Chocolate Souffle (pre-order of course, you won't regret it. Even if you're stuffed there's always room for dessert) Dim lighting and very intimate so great place to bring a date or a small group of close friends."
"This place is okay. Granted, we ordered pick up but I feel like this is definitely a place I would rather eat in rather than take out. The place was extremely busy but the staff seemed to keep a level head even when addressing us. They even had a DJ there spinning old records which was really cool. I definitely enjoyed the ambiance of this place is, but the food was just okay to me. I'm aye it's better in-house, but there are definitely better brunch places around. Also not a fan of being packed like sardines eating greasy breakfast food next to strangers, but I'm sure it would be an interesting experience as well."
"Came here with a friend the other day for the first time. Â I ordered the spinach and goat cheese omelet and we had a side order of pancake, with coffee. The omelet was above average, but the thing i remember the most is the pancake. Â It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Â I have definitely never had a pancake this tasty before. Â It was a little sweeter than regular pancakes, but the crispy outside is what makes it so delicious. The coffee was good, not burnt or overly bitter. Â Service was good too. I would definitely come back here again."
Simple and understated German food done well. Had the bratwurst/sauerkraut & emmentaler sausage/ cabbage/ quark dumplings - would recommend both. A bit too noisy for my liking though.
"Oh baby baby, gimme some more of THAT! Popped into Peaches HotHouse with a mean growling stomach, looking for a late brunch. I could have blindly pointed at anything on the menu and been happy-- it all sounded that good. I went with the corn cakes, andouille, and fried egg; yes, yes, and yes. The corn cakes had a sort of crunch on the outside, and then a nice pancake feel on the inside. Sweet corn was scattered throughout, and gave it that creamy sweetness I was looking for. The andouille was too good for words. Too. Good. For. Words. And the egg was cooked perfectly. This review really is a simple one. It come's down to this: Peaches, I love you. See you again soon."
"We made our way to Shanghai Asian Manor around lunchtime on a Sunday with enormous appetites and intense cravings for soup dumplings. The place was understandably packed with a small crowd waiting in line, but three tables opened up all at once after fifteen short minutes. We quickly ordered soup dumplings with pork, scallion pancakes, and dandan mian and excitedly waited for our meal. And waited. While I won't say that there was preferential treatment (oops, I just did) we watched the couple who were seated at the same exact time as us get a total of THREE dishes before we got a single one of ours. They cleaned two and a half of their dishes before we were finally awarded our soup dumplings. Thankfully, the food made up for our initial unhappiness. The soup dumplings had the perfect filling of gingery pork and sizzling, savory, clear broth. I don't think J and I actually really spoke much to each other as we were busy taming our growling stomachs, taking in the deliciousness, and trying hard not to let any of the soup spill (such a waste!). After we finished our eight soup dumplings, I really, really wanted another order just because they were that good. The scallion pancakes were a bit disappointing. Four large pieces came in one order, but they didn't contain a lot of scallions and were very greasy. The dandan mian, which I thought was supposed to be spicy, was actually very mild. It may not have been the most authentic because there was very little heat, but the flavorful sauce was addictive and my sensitive tongue was very happy. Our three dishes came out to a total of about $15! Amazing! This is also one of the few places in Chinatown that takes credit cards for orders over $20. Likelihood of another visit: When I have a craving for soup dumplings but don't want to wait too long, I know where to go."
"I'm not really sure what the hype is about. Waited over an hour and a half for ""cold"" meatballs. Don't get me wrong... I like meat... This just isn't my spot. the meatballs taste bland... I did like the ice cream sandwich, waitress, bar tender and SMALL & TIGHT atmosphere though lol will i come back? ehh don't think I'll go out of my way for this place."
"Grilled corn and mojitos = love. Â This may be the very best way to eat corn. Â  bring a buddy because 1 order yields 2 on a cob unless you want them all to yourself, and no one can blame you for your gluttony."
"I've been wanting to come here for years. My friends raved about this place but i could never get a reservation on short notice. I was so excited, I came a day before my actual reservation. Oops. The atmosphere was stunning. It was like being in the wonderland of Narnia or something. I don't know why I said that, but that's what it reminded me of. We got the favorites like crab toast and mushroom pizza but none of it really impressed me. The food overall seemed pretty standard. Such a shame too because I was expecting to have an amazing meal. Nothing stood out. For the amount of money you spend here, I think there are plenty more value for money restaurant options in NYC."
"Great neighborhood bar. Â  Last time I went was for dinner on a Saturday night. Â We had the potato pancakes, quesadilla, white bean dip, mac and cheese, and spicy chicken sandwich. Â Everything was pretty good, but not great. Â The chicken sandwich was probably my favorite, but it was very messy and a little difficult to eat. Â Around 11pm the place was so packed you could hardly move (more like an LES nightspot), so we didn't stay for post-dinner drinks. Personally, I think it is best to go on a weeknight, take a seat at the bar, and start trying some cocktails without all the folks who storm the place on weekends."
"I thought L'Artusi was pretty overrated. My gnocchi wasn't life changing and all of our portions were very small. We ordered multiple dishes between the two of us but I walked away still hungry. None of the food stood out as incredible, and I didn't like the long, narrowness of the place. It was also very loud for the upscale setting. I felt like I was sitting on top of our neighbors, and not in the cute dive bar kind of way... more in the I am getting so screwed when the check comes and I'm not even comfortable way."
Ha a soft shell crab spec that blew my mind. Good spicy ness levels. Specials are usually solid. Good prices as well
"Great farm to table restaurant. Ingredients are fresh. You cannot really go wrong with any of their dishes. Went there a few times for brunch and dinner. Always a very good experience. Portions are not too big, which I appreciate as it is so easy to over eat. Great service."
"Came back with a friend for brunch recently, and was shocked it was so empty! Â I'd made reservations in advance as last time had been so packed... Regardless, we got a seat in the window (centered between two other empty tables), our waiter was nice albeit a little forgetful (when we ordered additional drinks, went to fetch them at the bar ourselves at least once)...but let us sit there all day (as in got there at 1ish and we didnt leave til past 5..). My friend enjoyed her food (sadly i forget now what she'd gotten), and i loved the bloodies this go around! That said, sitting there all day adds up fast - think we both spent around $75 with tax and tip! and i only drank! still cute, and a great quiet place to catch up (unless it reverts back to its formerly packed status)."
"Great bar apps and well made drinks (off somewhat limited cocktail list). Â Fantastic selection of whiskeys. Â Some are a bit pricey by anyone's standards but you can't argues with the list. I've always enjoyed the entrees, but have never been blown away. Â For me it's all about the bar. Â And for that, 5 stars."
"Meh, I have experienced better from here before. Â Went to the take out side, mostly because the dining room had a 45 minute wait. Â  I'm not asking to be served like royalty, a great return customer, or even an average customer. Â I just ask that while you're working, you do it like you are somewhat enjoying it. Â Don't look like you want to shoot yourself each and every second you are taking orders. Â You are working in a service industry - provide it. The corn again was good, but then again, douse anything in sour cream and cheese, how bad could it be? Â The corn is succulent, tasty, and well priced though, at only $2 a pop. Â I of course ordered old faithful, the Cuban sandwich. Â Always a crowd pleaser. Â The woman got the fish sandwich, in burrito form. Â  Let's say, you need a deep sea diving excursion team to find the amount of fish in there. Â Scant pieces, not sure why I paid $8.50 for rice, beans, and old lettuce. Â I guess with the wait, they can charge whatever. Â $2.25 for a can of Diet Coke also. I'll come back, when the urge for a Cuban sandwich comes again, but, not sure if I will explore the menu."
"Carne asada burrito was closest to SF/mission style I've come across in the city! Â Meat could be a bit more grilled ie charred (as opposed to just cooked through) but that's a preference of chargrilled taste over a softer texture. Nonetheless, solid."
"Mmmm ...the pumpkin waffles tasted delicious. A very fun down to earth, casual dining setting. Great for brunch! I'm very curious to try everything on their menu! Must go!"
"Om nom nom nom nom! Brunch was amazing (and a great deal with all you can drink special). The Benedict was awesome, Derek had the burger with the egg on top and he looooved it. I stole a bite of the purple pancakes too and they were delicious (not you're average pancakes). Sausage and garlic fried rice was awesome too. Best brunch I've had in a while! Now I'm hungry..."
"Yummy! Went out for dinner a few weeks back, and it was great. A bit of a wait, no biggie. We were seated and began to take a look at the menu, which was extremely difficult to see in the dim lighting.. I don't wear glasses and have perfect vision, so I'm not blind. Ordered some mussels in white wine sauce which was delicious! I got salmon which was a special, the bff got linguini with clam sauce, auntie got the lamb chops. My salmon was delicious, I just wish it had more sauce to go with it. The linguini was cooked perfectly, and the clams were fresh and fully opened. The lamb chops were yummy also. For dessert we had bread pudding with some ice cream, delish! Will return!"
"Amazing fresh, homemade pasta! Â The agnolotti was so good--cheesy, fresh mushroom, light sauce. Â Their brunch deal is awesome too. Â I'll have to come back for the french toast and a mimosa. Â This is a great place to go with small group of friends on a Saturday or Sunday morning before you spend the day shopping."
"Where do I begin? We arrived a little bit after lunch, but some time before dinner, so they let us know that they were only serving a bar/interim menu. We were fine with that since we were simply starving. They offered us a table in the front or two seats at the end of the bar by the chef's table, which is where we went. We checked out the menu and ordered the mixed salad from the antipasta section and the POLPETTINE ($13) [prosciutto and mortadella meatballs baked in tomato sauce]. The polpettine arrived and I was surprised at how many meatballs they gave you. It was so much that I literally could have just had this as my lunch meal, so for $13 it seems like a REALY good value. We also the ordered SPAGHETTI ALLA VONGOLE ($18) clams, leeks, white wine, chile and the GRAMIGNA ($18) macaroni, pork sausage, black kale. The Cragmina was my dish and I savored every single bite of it. The pasta tasted freshly-made, and the pork sausage was evenly distributed throughout the dish so that every bite had pieces of it. Absolutely EVERYTHING we tried was impeccably made. The flavors, the spices, and the textures were fantastic. We also had a few desserts and beer. Everything was on-point. So, why not 5 stars?.. Well, the music threw us off. It seemed like music that should be playing at Johnny Rockets or Outback Steakhouse was on, and music like that should not be playing at such a classy restaurant as this. I program music for establishments everywhere and the right programming could add so much more sexiness and class to a place that already exudes it. Enjoy because you will love the food here."
"Recommends: V-Nam Traditional Pork Banh Mi Ordered: V-Nam Traditional Pork Banh Mi Spent: $6.50 for V-Nam Traditional Pork Banh Mi #1 on NYC Banh Mi List Two establishments, both alike in dignity, In fair Manhattan where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny... We have a new winner for the Best Banh Mi in NYC. It was hard, very hard, as I sat there chewing, I kept thinking Luu's or V-nam? Though I lay no claim on knowing the ins-and-outs of banh mi making, I do know a thing or two about banh mi eating. Where V-nam beats the likes of its contesters (Luu's, Banh Mi Zon, Xe May, Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich, Banh Mi Saigon - yes I have sampled them all...) lie in the bread and the freshness of the ingredients. It may seem silly, but the bread is so crucial to my banh mi experience. I have a downgraded banh mi so many times for the bread being dry, thick, not well buttered, stiff, etc but V-Nam's came out perfect. Warm, not overly buttered, crispy from the oven but won't hurt your mouth, and soft to bite into. All the ingredients inside your banh mi taste legit to put it bluntly. I don't care if it is actually just freezer packed sausage, it sure doesn't taste like it. The meats didn't have that been-too-long in the preservative package plastic burn, but the real magic was in the pate. It wasn't packed on hard, and it was the first time that I saw it even melt a little to the warmth of the bread. The pickled veggies were crunchy with flavor, and most of all they had a SUPER SPICY setting which came packed with those awesome green Thai chilis. Credit card is a $10 minimum. Though the contest was hard, this has definitely got my vote as #1...for now. Up next - Brooklyn."
"Another great cocktail place where I didn't try the food. Got in without issue on a Friday night around 8:30 - later on we had a slightly harder time getting friends in, but the doorman wasn't a jerk, the place was just packed. For somewhere trendy I liked that the staff was mostly pretty nice. Sure, bartenders were snotty and less likely to help you find your perfect drink - but they sure are pretty to look at. Scene was mixed, and if you were standing without a seat at the bar it was wayyyyy too crowded to enjoy. So come early to snag a seat or be ready to be bounced around."
"My first experience eating a macaron was Â four years ago at this apparently famous little shop on the Champs Ã‰lysÃ©es in Paris called Laduree. I had the strawberry and raspberry flavored macarons and was absolutely hooked at first bite. When I got back to the states I decided to try every macaron I could get my hands on but nothing compared to the little delights I had in France. Fast forward four years, I have moved to New York City and found out that Laduree has opened a store in the upper east side! The line was out the door but i was determined to get my macarons. I finally made it to the counter and got a box of 6. As I ate them they were just as light and airy as I remembered. Each bite was better than the next. Will definitely be a regular here now! Love this place"
"Try the fried shrimp house special appetizer! Â I've never had anything like it before at any other chinese restaurant. Â It's deep-fried & crunchy, w/o being greasy. Â I'm not 100% sure what the stuffing is made out of, but it's shrimp & water chestnuts w/ a medley of other goodness. Â I also had the seafood noodle soup, which was just okay. Â The place had nice comfort food & reminded me of home, but it's definitely not as authentic as all the teo chow noodle houses in LA! Â  I came here 10 minutes before closing, and the wait staff was still very nice! Â They let us take our time ordering, eating, and paying, which is sadly atypical of a lot of chinese restaurants (I was practically pushed out the door at Big Wong King!) Â I really appreciated their courtesy!"
"Um, Artichoke, where have you been all my life? Creamy crab pizza. Simple margarita pizza. Both to fucking die for... I love you. NYC pizza shits on anything in LA, I'm so jelly."
"Oh Bogota! I can't say enough good things about this place. It's the one place in my neighborhood where I can meet with friends who are vegen, gluten free, or paleo and have everyone find something they love. The food is a delight and the drinks are dangerous. The best combination in my opinion. Go there as soon as you can. Just remember to make a reservation if you're planning to get a table on the weekends for dinner at primetime."
"This. place. is. the. best. Hands down, Soup Spot is the best soup place in the area (possibly even all of Manhattan). The storefront itself is miniscule - it's just a counter - but they have a huge variety of fresh, made-daily soups that are delicious and easy on the wallet. I've tried the lobster bisque, chicken noodle, turkey with sweet corn chowder, and southwest cheesy chicken and none have disappointed. There was once a tiny piece of shell in my bisque, but it was so yummy that I didn't mind. I love that the large soup is only $6 and comes with a piece of bread and an apple, and I love how friendly the guys who work the counter are. I remember being so taken aback that someone in NYC was actually asking me about my day before taking my order. They also have sandwiches, salads (call ahead for those), cookies, brownies and chips if you don't want soup or need something else to tide you over. Soup Spot, you are my one true love."
"When Get Fresh first opened I swore I would never set foot in the place. Â Then it was a market, not a restaurant, and had these ridiculously sparsely filled fridges of prepared food. Â I just thought the whole concept was absurd and silly and I vowed to never go there. Â  I think they got wind of the fact that their original concept was silly and changed their vision more to restaurant than market (though there are still some things for sale, which I'm ok with). Â So when B. suggested we go out for breakfast for something ""fresh"" and yummy, this place came to mind. I knew that Mark ""I don't think Tom likes me"" from Top Chef was now the chef here, too, and I was curious to see what it was all about. The brunch menu is pretty modest. Â They have a bread basket, some egg dishes, a blt, a breakfast burrito, a pork sandwich and huevos rancheros. Â I think that may be it. Â There wasn't anything that jumped out at me on it. Â  I settled for the braised pork sandwich, which they were apparently out of so they'd made it with chicken instead. Â It's served with farmstead cheese, bean spread and roasted red peppers with a small side salad. Â It was good, not amazing, but I especially liked whatever they did with the peppers. Â They were nicely sweet and good. Â I think the pork, the way it's usually prepared, would be richer and maybe yummier than the chicken. B. got the huevos rancheros because I think it's physically impossible for him not to order it when it's on a menu. Â It is his favorite thing ever. Â It looked good, but in a healthy way. Â And I think he was a little let down by that. Â I think when you order huevos rancheros, healthy may not be what you're going for. Â That said, I tend not to like the greasiness of huevos rancheros and this was a dish I might actually like. Â Instead of refried beans there were these yummy looking pale green beans (I don't know what kind) that were very appealing to me. Overall I thought the food was pretty simple and fine, but nothing to rave about. Â I did really like their garden area. It was peaceful and comfortable and I'm sort of intrigued to try it again at dinner time. Â But I probably won't be back for brunch."
"Brindle room is along the same vein of northern spy co, back forty...good American fare in the east village. And I do this their burger is worth the write up. It's yummy and separates itself from others in the area with its blend and really good cheddar."
"Brought my 10 month old (at that time) with us for date nite, thank goodness it wasn't too crowded. The staff was really friendly and cooperative with us having my child with us. It's a tight spot to bring an infant to, but we managed to have their delicious food and fun times. Thank you for making it an eventful and fun evening for all of us especially my little one."
"I was surprised to hear that my friend booked a reservation at this place one month in advance. Â I can see why. First off, the brunch special is a good deal. Can you say unlimited sangria? Second, the restaurant was a buzzing with patrons at 12pm, which I thought was early for brunch but not for the crowd. Â The service was good, and the food was tasty. I ordered to Vaca Frita which was skirt steak with spanish fried rice and fried eggs and avocado. It cost $18. Was able to finish with a quickness. The portion size was just right."
"AHHHH!!! we came here for the grilled corn since this was my request. We taxi here just to buy corns! So worth it!!! It was cheap too! I think it was $2/corn, and this was probably one of the best corns I have ever had!!! If I am back in town, I would def stop by again!! Man, what is the white powdery stuff they smear all over the corn? It is SOOOOOO GOOOODDDD!!!"
"Pretty good food, the portions are normal sized. I don't think pickles are their standout offering even though their name says ""pickles"", and there are a variety of pickled items to choose from. I had the fried chicken which came with grits. It was boneless, but the meal was full and satisfying."
Like an upgraded Chipotle. Â The steak is superb.
"Im giving this place two stars because of its service. Food here is delicious, everything is juicy and tasty. But the waiter wasn't so friendly to us (two Asian girls). At the same time, he seemed to be very nice to some other male nonasian customes. The waiter was a Japanese male with long hair, he never came to ask us how we were doing, and he was never to be found when we needed to order more food. We had to ask the cook to place extra orders... THEN the waiter came over and asked us rudely to only place orders with him. When we tried to explain and apologize, he just turned around and left. Enough said.... I will not go back to the restaurant in a long time because of the very uncomfortable feeling he had left us."
"Can I fairly judge? Â Probably not since the ones I had were a day old. They did not taste anything special to me. Â I prefer the ones at La Maison du Chocolat. Even though they are outrageously expensive, due to reviews and friend saying it was the best macaroon she ever had, I will return to give it another try fresh this time. So- eat your macaroons the same day -- next day: Â not good."
"Great restaurant and extremely cool atmosphere. Â The Spotted Pig is very trendy and is a local hotspot. Â The food is very good. Â It's definitely on the more expensive side, but well worth it. Â They have great beers, good cocktails and solid food. Â Great place to go hang out with friends over food/drinks, or a great date spot. Â GET THE BURGER!! Â One of the top burgers in NYC."
"very nice environment! the dishes were creative but delicious! most important, it was not expensive at all, what it offered worth for the money!"
"This TriBeCa location pales in comparison to the restaurant in the Time Warner Center in terms of space and ambiance, however the food is just as OUTSTANDING! I came with a large group on a rainy night, and though we had a reservation, we had to wait a bit for our table...it seems the rain delayed the prior diners (who had a ton of kids with them...who brings kids to a steakhouse?!) from wanting to leave. It was annoying in that we had nowhere to comfortably stand (the restaurant layout has no foyer or waiting area), but the staff was very patient with us and filled us in to the status of our table frequently. We got some drinks at the bar in the back and tried (somewhat successfully) to stay out of the way of the servers. Once seated, we ordered a ton of food, and everything was delicious. We shared some Mussels in a rosemary cream sauce with French Fries, Meatballs, Grilled Octopus, and Fried Calamari to start. For entrees, most of us ordered steak...versions of Filet Mignon and NY Strip were most popular, though a couple of people ordered the pasta specials. My Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth...and the steak fries were also done to a crisp! For dessert we ordered a tasting platter, but I was most interested in the Cotton Candy, which is really just for kids, but our server indulged us anyway! This location is close to my office, so I hope to go back for another steak soon! But if you want to be WOWed by the entire Landmarc dining experience, eat uptown."
Sunday brunch is crowded. I liked the bloody mary.
"Appetizers: Stuffed Tofu & Papaya Salad Entrees: Pumpkin Curry, Crispy Chicken w/ Five Seed, & Tom Yam Fried Rice Solid Thai place -- good portions; excellent flavor."
"Follows the trajectory of many Thai places: good to excellent starters followed by fair to middling mains, although to be fair to Tuk Tuk that might reflect a personal preference for the grilled/dumpling-y/sticky/toothsome small plate things rather than the moundy/ricey/soupy/meat-n-veg, coriander and basil with everything big plate things. We have various things on skewers (tasty), followed by an underspiced (the menu cautions that this dish is fearsomely hot - it wasn't) beef and rice dish, and an egg noodle, roast pork and fried wonton street food thingie which was less than the sum of its parts. Service was friendly, and prices gentle."
"Pros: Great congee (I got the roast duck) Flexible to customize any order (like adding thousand year egg or fried egg) Superb value for money. I had my lunch for 7$ Cons: Chicken sauce tasted like the pre-made kind and lacked real flavor Limited condiments for congee (which you have to ask for and are provided on a side plate, and not in those tiny jars that are typical) Cash only I might just come back for the congee."
"This was a perfect, light, and surprisingly filling Japanese meal! I stumbled upon Cha-An when I was wandering the neighborhood w/ a friend looking for somewhere to eat. Being two girls who love tea, we decided this was a great spot to try and we both loved it! We got the Cha-An set B, which came with a bunch of small dishes. The soup wasn't anything spectacular, but the daily vegetable (dashi-soaked eggplant) - was amazingly good. I like eggplant, but I loved this! The tea-smoked salmon was very flavorful and was served upon some very fresh greens. The soy milk quiche was a very yummy chawan mushi-like dish and of course I loved it, it's one of the most comforting Japanese dishes available! They gave us two different desserts so we got to try more things, which was nice. What blew me away though was the selection of tea. Simply stunning selection of tea, it was so hard to pick one! And the best part was they kept refilling our hot water without us having to ask. Only drawback, it's cash only. So make sure to stop at the ATM on your way here."
"Been going here for over 5 years and they've only messed up once which is well worth a 5 star rating. Excellent fresh pasta, amazing baked clams, and the service is decent, not to mention one of the best wine lists in the city, affordable with plenty of delicious options."
"So I came back the week after I wrote a review of Heidi's House cuz I couldn't stop thinking about the food. I went with my friend visiting from Philly and he was amazed as well. I wanted to try new entrees this time,, but it was hard not to get the gnocchi. I also was on the mission to have my friend explore the new world of gnocchi. So we got the gnocchi... again, melts in your mouth. My friends were definitely satisfied :) Tried the lobster mac n cheese finally! But sadly I wasn't a huge fun of it as the other mac n cheese here. Because the lobster is not salty like the chorizo or bacon, overall the dish was bland. My fav Heidi's mac n cheese in order so far is: mushroom and truffle oil - bacon - chorizo - lobster. I need to get the remaining cauliflower one next time I come. I gave a shot at the paella. 4stars for this one. It doesn't come out as ""family portion"" like most other places. What I really liked was it had less rice and abundant chunks of seafood. Fish tacos were one of the specials that day. The mango salsa gave a good sweetness to the soft fish. If I have to compare, I do like the shrimp tacos more, but both are good!! Had to get the bread pudding again and have my friends explore a new world again haha My friend saw the people next to us get a 'molten lava cake-look like dessert' and was saying how he wanted that after we put in the bread pudding order. But he realized that cake was the bread pudding. We called around 5:30 to put our name down for 3people around 8pm. My 2 friends were really late but the owner? was so kind enough to have me sit at the bar for half an hr and wait for my friends, even though an infinite amount of customers kept on coming in. I felt so bad but they always have great polite service."
"Nicely decorated, simple menu and great food. Â I am always amazed at restaurants with small list of items on the menu because it translates to better quality food. Â They don't have to worry so much about making so many things but concentrate on making great tasting food. BAR - small (very small) but equipped with all of your necessary adult beverages (i opted for Melbec and it was $12 / glass; we ended up ordering the whole bottle lol) SEATING - wooden tables with mirrors all around and like many other NYC restaurants very close to your neighbors (we sat in the back by the wall couches and it was cozy and private) FOOD - started with mussels (seasoned perfectly with onions and parsley) and mozarella & tomato salad (crunch egg plant in the middle with fresh mozarella); there were 4 of us so we ordered all different things but i would say the seabass was excellent (the short ribs were very good with spinach and friend onions). I would go back for and next time sit outside; only 2 people can sit so nice for a date if you prefer."
"This was a somewhat unfortunate case of ""I was expecting more."" It wasn't bad, it just wasn't GREAT. Â The portions were pretty small, so I left the place still hungry. Â And c'mon, where are those side dishes? Â Give me more side dishes. Â The fried chicken looks so naked and lonely without them. Â Serve it properly with mac and cheese or mashed potatoes or SOMETHING, dammit. Â  Also, I would say their cocktail menu is a bit... misguided. Â I ordered a gin drink (the revival) and it was really sweet. Â Like, too sweet. Â I ended up taking a sip, saying ""blech,"" and passing it off onto a friend, who ended up having the same reaction. Â I was hoping for a bit more of a balance among the ingredients. Â I also wasn't a fan of their michelada. The positives: - The arctic char was really good - People aren't lying about the peanut brittle - They make a strong gin and tonic"
"I'm a fan not because the food is spectacular or anything but more out of convenience. Â After returning from week long road trip to Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Maine, I kinda wanted to try the lobster roll for myself to see how it compares. It was good. Â It was as fresh as it was gonna get in NYC. Â I recommend it. Â Def. Â Also, you can't beat the fact that it's available at the Brooklyn Flea and spend the afternoon browsing treasures."
"Our party came here for dinner and drinks and everything was splendid. The dining area was intimate, Â dimly lit and hummed of conversation. Â My friends each ordered an app and entree, but I chose to go the I-am-going-to-order-my-weight-in- appetizers-but-only-eat-a-portion-of it method. Â This is a fave of my compadres because as bystanders they get to partake. :) I ordered the steak tartare (my favorite, Â and prepared at the table), duck confit salad (a bit salty, but dressed nicely), the bacon wrapped lamb (cooked to a nice medium rare, Â this app was entree sized) and lastly the famed bone marrow poppers (my least favorite, Â as it was more puff pastry than anything). Drink wise I didn't order from the menu, Â but instead asked the waiter to have the bartender make me his best bourbon concoction and he didn't disappoint. Great for a date night or with friends, Â I highly recommend EO!"
"Love the ambience but the food and wine were only okay. Â We started with the moules marniere, which was in a tasty broth. Â The entrees (duck and cassoulet) were decent but nothing I would go back for. Â In comparison, the duck and cassoulet we recently had at Le Gigot were more flavorful and memorable. Â The biggest disappointment was the wine list - I know they have only had liquor since jan 2014 but when we decided to spend my bday at a French bistro, we expected wonderful wine options. Â The servers didn't seem to know much about the wine options and we tried two tastes that we did not enjoy before finally settling on a bottle of a dry red that was decent but not great. Â Service is slow but everyone is very nice. Â Profiteroles are delicious."
"Halal guys is not only one of the best values in town... Â It's one of the best meals in town. The menu is simple... Sandwich or plate, chicken lamb or falafel. Â Have tried everything but the falafel and all are good. Â It's no secret I put way too much sauce on everything I eat, But like everyone else is writing... The sauces really complete the entree. Â The spicy sauce is fire and the white sauce is the perfect compliment. Must stop cart for sure! Â Protip: Â Don't be deceived by the long lines... Often moves faster than you would guess. Â A decent length line often means you get fresher food... Much better than the stale stuff you'll often find over on 7th ave!"
"I was looking for a quick bite in the area after shopping, and I came across this small cafe that seemed to have a good menu. I ordered a fried cauliflower sandwich with pickles, and it was a delicious and filling meal that felt light but still completely had me leaving full. The flavors were delicious and the spicy sauce they offered added a lot of depth to the sandwich! Overall, a nice spot for a quick bite at a great price."
"Not only is the Cuban and Grilled corn pairing the best thing I've eaten in Brooklyn, but the venue is incredible! It's perfect for a sunny day and a great staple in Fort Greene. Friends love coming here when they visit and I have no problem returning time after time. The service is quick and consistent. Highly recommended!!!"
"I am not an easy 5-star person, but after my fourth visit to silver rice in 4 weeks, I decided it was only right. Franklin ave has been in desperate need of some good sushi, and Silver Rice hits the spot. For what it does Silver Rice does an amazing job. The fish is fresh, the rice is perfect, the takeaway appetizers are tasty. The rice bowls and chirashi bowls are delicious. There are no inside seats, which makes the patio all the more sweet in the summer months. Excited to see where these guys go in the future!"
"hole in the wall gem that i'm SO glad I found while all the other tourists were waiting an hour and a half at a regular old brunch place. the tiny restaurant is just one long bar. Â when you wait, the only room is directly behind the diners sitting at the bar. Â When we came at about 12pm on a Thursday, the place was completely full but it cleared up pretty quickly and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. Â You can tell it's a great establishment when every diner there was a regular and said goodbye to the owner by his first name, Robert? I think? The cooks are super efficient in taking your order. Â They have the tough Ukranian/Polish vibe where they all wear white shirts and aprons, but are Super sweet to the diners and provide great service. We got 2 eggs and corned beef hash and the kielbasy omlette with breakfast potatoes each with a side of challah bread. Def good rib-sticking hangover food, healthy portions... will need to return for the pierogi and borscht."
"In a city with so many thai places per capita I would have expected more from this place. Â The pad thai was very good, however the service was HORRIBLE and the other dishes we ordered were lackluster. I would not recommend the drunken noodles, the spring roles or the pork belly taco. The meat however was very tasty as they use meat from local farms and are not raised with antibiotics, however you only get a few pieces of it per order. I might give it another try, but I am not sure."
"For NYC this is great Mexican food. The margaritas are also fantastic. The wait can be insane, but if you go at an off time, you'll really enjoy the decor and the cuisine."
"I wanted to love these, but...meh. If they had come as a side dish I probably would have enjoyed them more, but as the focus of a restaurant/a meal they fall short. The shop is very small and isn't really the ideal place to stay. This definitely feels like a street food, grab-and-go kind of establishment. Thus, I was surprised to find that some of my fries were cooked to perfection, lightly seasoned and golden brown on the outside, and fluffy and soft on the inside. However, even the regular is kind of a large portion and I'd say about a good 25%-40% of those fries are of questionable quality. I did like the sweet mango chutney mayo that everyone is raving about but it didn't taste too much like mango or chutney. Really, I got a sweet, tangy, mayo. Nice, but I'm not going to be running back to Pommes Frites."
"Delicious food. Adorable, quaint Parisian atmosphere. Came here for dinner and sat by the window in the back room. Had the crispy squash blossoms to start-- amazing!! savory + cool citrus from the arugula salad-- and the homemade cavatelli which came with lots of fresh vegetables. My bf had the duck- I usually don't like duck- but it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the rich flavors of the meat were balanced out with a sweet couscous. We shared the strawberry rhubarb pie for dessert (the crust was not my favorite) but it was good. Wines by the glass were ok-- we had the chablis and the pinot grigio. I love everything about this place. Including the bizarre cricket statue on the ceiling of the back room!"
"I can safely say I am obsessed with Eataly. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it is pricey. But it really doesn't stop me from going, uh, like 3 times a week. Go early, it becomes a tourist paradise after 1ish. But who cares really, because it is one of the best places in the city. I recommend walking around for 15 minutes, exploring, then settle on where you want to grab a bite, or a drink. La Piazza is first come first serve, it has standing tables and is good if you want some wine, cheese, and meat. All their coffee drinks are amazing, but it can take a while when it's busy, don't expect to grab a latte and go. There's too much to write about Eataly, just go and find what you like. Great place to bring anyone who hasn't been, or someone who really loves Italian food, or just anyone."
"I don't fuckin' know what mooncake is, but don't care, everything tastes fuckin' good. I don't fuckin' know why they located middle of nowhere, but don't care, it's fuckin' cheap. I don't fuckin' know why some waitresses are doing nonsense stuff, but don't care, this place is fuckin' awesome."
"Yum!! Very good ramen! I give it 4.5 stars. I don't think the ramen noodles is homemade, because Samurai Mama is a udon place, not a ramen place. That being said, their ramen is still fricken awesome!! Love the broth, vegetables, and pork. The ramen comes with side salad, egg and side vegetable. I also notice inside their broth it had sauteed scallions and thin slices of eggplant-- this is a bit original, but I really like this because I enjoy having more than just the typical char siu pork in there. Overall, delicious!! Place was cute and cozy. Note: CASH ONLY!!"
"Pros: 1. They serve gluten free empanada! I have been trying to not consume gluten for the few past weeks so this is a great! 2. They have long list of menu! Huge selections of empanadas! Great creativity you have there. 3. Open 24/7 4. $3 empanada? I'm sold! Where else in Manhattan you can get great lunch as cheap as that? 5. They do delivery! Cons: 1. The place is small (look at the pic below!). Our table was literally so closed to other table next to us. Oh and this is not a friendly place for a group of 5 or more. 2. I do not like how they include the 18% tip into our bill. Â I would not pay that much for the crappy service we got there!

"Despite the high prices, small portions and cramped seating this is one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. They just serve about half the amount of food I'd get at most restaurants with a similarly priced menu. Everything on the menu that I've had is perfectly prepared with the exception of the salted chocolate caramel pie. It is so intensely salty and sugary that it made me shake and ruined my meal. the thing is that I managed to forget that I'd ordered it before. Why did I order it TWICE!?"
Definitely not the best. Over hyped and over priced (CASH ONLY). Well i'm from San Francisco and I feel that all the places in NY is OVER hyped. I really liked Mama's back in San Francisco. I think my expectation was too high for Clinton St. Baking Company. I had high hopes that it would have been better or just as good as Mama's. Â  But I guess this place is okay for New York. Sorry I'm a California foodie snob.
"The French toast is memorable in a very good way. Â the egg omlet, greens and potatos are pretty good but nothing special. Overall I would go back just for the French toast."
"I really wanted to dislike this place. The whole super modern upscale esthetic seems sort of strange in the west village. Don't get me wrong, the wooden tables and white leather banquettes are pretty. Â It just feels like the Meatpacking District, which I loathe, is infiltrating further down into the West Village, and that places like this will edge out all the cozy neighborhood joints. Â  But that wily Jean George charmed me, yes he did. Â The amuse-bouche was a strawberry soup with a cloud of cucumber foam. Â I was skeptical - a mouthful of room-temperature liquid strawberry? Â But after a few sips I had to agree with my mom: it was indeed a ""taste sensation."" Â We shared a brunch item referred to as ""asparagus/fried egg/sourdough"" which was just extraordinary. Â Perfectly cooked asparagus, little bacon lardons, tiny crunchy cubes of sourdough bread that I think may have been cooked in the bacon fat, topped with fried eggs and thin slivers of red pepper. Â The presentation was gorgeous and the flavors were sensational. Â  Not really my scene, but I can't deny the tastiness."
"Very yummy ramen. Â Just as good as ippudo BUT they have such a small space. Â Be prepared to wait, even if u come early. Â It's easier to seat you if u r just two ppl. Â If this one is too busy try their other location one block over."
"Best Brunch in New York so far... Been searching for 6 months for a decent brunch needs to have good food, nice drinks and great atmosophere. Â Started badly walking down a dingy alley in the lower east side, but hidden at the end was a gem of a restaurant. Â Already busy but sat down straight away. Â classic brumch food with a small twist. Â Eggs fluffy bacon crispy. Â One person had the based eggs (Q:""whats a baked egg"" A:""its an egg we bake"" - really?) - but it was excellent. Â Started with a cinnamon cake - delicious. Â will be going back many times."
"Came here for lunch and was seated immediately! The appetizers in my opinion are so much better than the main dish. We ordered all three types of empanadas (sweet corn/cheese, chicken, beef) and the mac&cheese. I highly highly recommend the mac&cheese -- it was really good and one of my favorite dishes of the day. For the main course, I ordered salmon on a bed of mashed potatoes. Apparently you can choose how well done you want your salmon. I asked for medium rare and I felt it was just perfect. It was very tender but still fully cooked. It tasted very well with the mashed potatoes (that were kind of purple-ish). Great place to check out if you've never had Cuban food!"
"It's a smallish place, with a bar in front and tables in the back and along the side. They have a good beer list with several unusual ones on tap, and several more in bottles. Unfortunately, I had such great company that I forgot to write the details. The food was the usual, although the fried stuff (sweet potato fries, pigs in a blanket, calamari) was fried much less than usual. That made everything less greasy and more tasty than usual bar food. For us international ESL folks, the best thing was the lack of blasting music or TV sets, although there were a few TVs on with the volume off. You could actually talk to the person next to you without screaming. Another bonus was the various happy hours... three a day during the week. If your drinks are adjustable (including the not bad Alfie's Ale) you can get away with a moderate bill here. Friendly service is another plus.--Drink Club NYC is a roving group of NY drinkers, a different bar every week."
"4.5 stars Amaze-balls! Yeah, I said it. This place is amaze-balls. The food is fantastic, the service is fantastic, and the prices are fantastic. I deducted .5 of a star because the wait is soooo long, but the food is soooo worth it! My friend and I came here today with plans to have a hearty delicious breakfast. We arrived a quarter to 11 to find that there was a 2 hour wait!! I almost turned back and said lets find somewhere else but didn't because I knew that any other place we went to would not compare. So we sucked it up, put our names down on the list, and went to the nearest Starbucks to chill out and kill time until the hostess texted us that our table was ready. We were also optimistic that we would be seated before the 2 hour estimate. We walked around, took in the sites, (can't wait to try Katz Deli which is nearby), and hung out at Starbucks until a little after 12. We then decided we would head over and see the progress we made on the list. The hostess also said that when you leave, you have 5 minutes to get back after your name is called or after they text you that your table is ready. We get there and she tells us we will be seated in about 10 more minutes much to our pleasure lol, and then looks back and says wait, a table just opened up so we can seat you guys right now. Music to my hungry ears! We were seated in a comfy corner and given time to look over the menu although we both knew what we wanted. I got the popular Blueberry Â pancakes ($14) with a side order of smoked bacon ($5) because I couldn't help myself and so glad I did, freakin delicious; while my friend got the chicken and waffles and a cappuccino. She was raving about her food at the same time I was raving about my food. From the very first bite of my soft, fluffy pancake I could tell why Clinton Street Baking Company is so special and so popular. The warm maple butter syrup that accompanied the pancakes were literally the icing on the cake. The taste is so light and airy with just the right amount of sweet. The mimosa ($10) I ordered complimented the food perfectly. Our waitress was so nice and attentive. She had a warm, smiling face as soon as we sat down. It's because she knows she works for an amazing establishment. Even the water was delicious! I mean, it tasted like it came from a spring! Despite the terrifying wait, which seems to go by faster than you expect, Clinton Street Baking is an experience you must have! Tourist or native. The brunch here is nothing short of fantastic. I cannot wait to come back and experience the other items on their menu! Just a heads up, be sure to bring sufficient cash because it is cash only during the daytime hours! I cannot wait to come back. Really glad I came :)"
"Maxim rated the banh mi here as the number one sandwich in America a couple of years and I couldn't agree more. I usually come here alone (there is no way to eat a sandwich here while still looking classy) when I want to spend less than $5 to fill up. A former flame with a palette difficult to please first brought me here when you really couldn't tell that this was a sandwich shop. Back then, it was literally a hole in the wall and I don't think I could've found it on my own. Now, it seems that this place is pretty poppin'. They've sinced moved to their current location on Grand Street with an actual SIGN, so you really can't miss it. It's the only Asian place on that block, nestled between Italian restaurants. Everytime I come here around lunch time, there are a ton of people. But they have a great system going so you never have to wait too long for your sandwich. I always get the #1 (roast pork banh mi). If you ask for it spicy, they'll put jalapeno peppers in there. THE BUN: Toasted to perfection. Crisp outer layer with a soft, moist inner. Crumbs will get all over the place, but trust me; it's worth looking like a slob. THE MEAT: Slightly sweet roasted pebbles of pork yumminess. Also might get all over the place but it's amazing! THE VEG: Strings of pickled radish and carrots offers the right touch of acidity. Some leaves of cilantro make this sandwich complete. The quality of this sandwich is ALWAYS consistent. I don't know how they do it. Don't question it, just accept that they have some kind of deal with the devil. The milk tea leaves something to be desired though. I'd get it elsewhere unless you're in a rush. ALSO note that you can get the sandwiches ""For tomorrow"". Meaning they'll give it to you with the veggies separate so you can heat the bun & meat in the oven (so it gets crisp and warm), while keeping the veggies nice and cool."
"What a cool concept! Please come to LA!!! Loved that there was so many Italian offerings all under one roof. I don't even know what to do with the gazillion different types of dry pastas sitting on the store shelves. What's the difference?! As for the restaurant, we ended up settling on the pizza and pasta joint. Got their fresh made Â tagliatelle with a short rib ragu. Sauce is yummy, pasta was al dente and springy at the same time. My friend got the squid ink pasta and that just didn't float my boat. I've had squid ink pasta at other places, but this one was just way too seafood-y in smell and taste. Not sure if I'd recommend the pasta restaurant, but I definitely would recommend checking out the store."
"Spicy and full of flavor, there wasn't a bad dish ordered at our table. We got there just in time to have their meatball special app (last order) and were pleasantly surprised by the spice. I would definitely re-order the fish curry (my favorite of the night) and the mushroom buns, but the fried chicken wasn't as flavorful as the other dishes. The ginger beer is on point- any drink that adds it should rock!"
"A little restaurant with Tintin everywhere (well kind of). My three friends and I came for brunch at 2:30pm and we were seated in under 20 min. Apparently, brunch goes on until 5pm. We had family style brunch, so we ordered 3 different dishes to share. We got the banana split belgian waffle with vanilla bean ice cream; omelet with gruyere cheese, blackforest ham and tomatoes; and chicken and waffle with fries. We also ordered two coffees and two lattes. Everything was delicious. The waffles weren't too sweet, but soft with a little crisp, chicken was tender, and the omelet was fluffy. All that was $70. One star deducted for the slow service, but the food was well worth it."
I just don't get how this place can survive when there is chipotle. The food they make in dos toros is tasteless in the best case. It's not even spicy! And it looks kind of trashy...why are you ppl go there in such an excitement?
"This review is based on my most recent dining experience and we only ordered a double bacon sandwich and a calamari salad. Â My friend said the sandwich was just okay. Â I loved the dressing and arugula in my salad, but the calamari was deep fried, wrapped with think flour, and hard to eat. Â I only had two or three pieces. Â However the portion is huge, like Penelope's other stuff. Â I was still quite full simply eating the greens and the rich dressing. Â I am not saying I don't like this place. Â I just ordered the wrong thing. Â Will definitely go back to try other stuff."
"Like most Danny Meyer restaurants, this is another remarkably well run and most importantly consistent restaurant. Â It's in the Gramercy hotel and has an oddly country style trattoria setting. Â The suckling pig was probably the highlight of the meal. Â I'd probably recommend going here for brunch or lunch rather than choosing this place for a romantic dinner out in the city. Â Service was excellent almost as if Danny gave a copy of setting to table to all his employees to read. Â While you could probably easily find 20 other restaurants in nyc as good as Mailano, you will probably will still have a decent memorable meal if you choose to go here."
"IMO, it's good, but not THAT good. it's another greasy spoon of tacos and guac. for over an hour wait time, i'd rather hit cafe el portal or mercadito for tastier fare. plus the random 'chino' decor is a little freaky and really doesn't belong"
"The moment you walk through the door, you embrace a feeling of warmth and the delicious scent of golden apples. The staff is top notch - professional and helpful and with a sense of humor! The setting is intimate. Bouley is dimly lit to create that romantic atmosphere. And I love how this restaurant has that nostalgic feeling to it. Imagine sitting in a red velvet chair next to your loved one in a room painted burgundy with gold tint in front of a fireplace and rustic bookshelf. Warm and cozy... Don't you get that tingly feeling? :) Whatever you decide for your courses, I can GUARANTEE that you'll fall in love with the food. I had ordered the mushrooms as my appetizer and the chicken as my main course. On top of that, the staff had given each table additional courses. So if you think you're going to leave hungry, think again! Fine dining at its best? Oh, yes! So what about the food?! - The blue cheese foam with a beet puree was sweet and savory and melted in my mouth like butter. - The flatbread tart with potato puree was so light and crisp that it literally fell apart in my mouth. I think it's the thinnest flatbread I have ever had in my life! - In my appetizer were slices of toro along with several types of mushrooms. I must say, it was exquisite and soooo delicious. - For my main course, they actually had first presented to us the pot they had used to cook the chicken. The pot was sealed with a piece of whole wheat bread that baked as the chicken was cooked. This locked in the moisture of the chicken and let me tell you, it's one of the most moist pieces of chicken I have ever had! It was just so juicy that I was still dreaming about it last night. The bread that sealed the pot did wonders! Amen. - Geing the dessert fiend that I am, I was extremely pleased that the chef gave us complimentary dessert dishes! My favorite was the frozen white chocolate foam topped with matcha powder. I felt like a kid again in a chemistry lab. That white chocolate foam literally melted in my mouth the moment it entered my mouth but it tasted so good like light foamy ice cream. Great date spot & great place to celebrate a fancy occassion. I will definitely be back at Bouley again!"
"Supper has been my staple for group dinners for over 7 years. Delicious fresh produce, great salads, amazing wine selection and wine ""cellar"" next to the dining room, and really beautifully prepared entrees. Most of all I love the ambiance- romantic, cutely laid out with different rooms, and really funky side bar. You can get to the bar by going next door, but there's also a secret little way to get there down some stairs."
"Cheap and delicious. Summer rolls ($5.50): awesome, with sizable shrimp within and a big serving of the peanut sauce. Beef pho ($7.50): big portion of beef and noodles, with an impeccable broth. We asked nicely and the cashier was able to split the bill between two credit cards."
- Good For a Late at Night or Lunch - This is awesome and only here you can eat this. one is enough Â for two girls. The Best order is the combination of chicken & ram over Â rice. you can ask them the amount of yogurt & hot sauce whatever you'd like. the
"One of the great things I love about tapas places is that it gives you a great opportunity (and excuse) to try several dishes in one sitting. Come with someone with an adventurous palette and you're in even better shape! This a great quaint space with dim lighting - great for a first date (which was actually how I the pleasure of discovering this place). He had been here before so we ordered a couple of his faves like the charred shishito peppers and the chicken liver mousse. Both were really good. The peppers were particularly good for sharing. The chicken liver had this extra little something something flavor that made it unique from any other liver mousse I've had before. I think it's the sherry. We also went for the veal tongue. I've never seen this item offered on a menu before. I was adventurous. He was adventurous. We ordered it. Was it good? Yes. Would I want to eat more of it? I'm good on veal tongue for now. On to the suckling pig special! This was indeed a special. The meat was insanely tender and the skin was, of course, the best part. I have no idea what this dish cost, but it couldn't have been cheap. Â  Our meal also included another daily special - the scallops. The dish came with two scallops. They were a decent size, but there were only two...They were tasty, but we ordered them towards the end of the meal so it definitely put me at the point of ""how much more can I fit in my belly and still be seen as a lady"" threshold."
"Every time I come here, they have a different menu but everything is good! I like going to this place since its small and cozy. Â The servers are friendly and attentive. We were a big group of 8 and all of us had a great time. Â We all arrived at a different times so we had a long period for cocktails -- we ordered Blue Point oysters which were fresh and succulent, truffle fries, crispy chickpeas which was a pleasant surprise, and portabella fries. Â  For my main course, I had a pork chop that was tender and juicy! Â My friends ordered the scallops, Â rabbit saddle, game hen and everything was good. We also tried their special for the day which was pork fat back -- it was the crispy rind and it was soooo good! For dessert, we had the chocolate peanut butter cup and our server suggested the bread pudding and we ended up ordering more of the bread pudding! I will definitely come back!"
"Great little pre-theater place to eat and have a few drinks. Food is really good, service is friendly, nice ambiance on both floors."
"Katsu-Hama serves many choices of different types of katsu dishes as well as noodle dishes such as ramen and udon as a soup or a plate. I went here for lunch to try the lunch special offered from 11:30AM to 3PM where you pick one type of meat that is served with rice, miso soup and homemade pickles. I ordered the breaded pork loin cutlet for $12 that's accompanied by a large bed of shredded cabbage (a sort of side salad). Though the picture of the lunch item showed one cutlet, the actual dish came with 2 of them so I was happy. You also get a small mortar bowl filled with sesame seeds and pestle to crush the seeds that will be used in the dipping sauce for the main dish. I thought this was a nice touch and really added to the dining experience. I also liked the fact that there was a good amount of hot mustard on the plate. The breaded pork loin cutlet is served whole, not sliced up as pictured on the menu, so you can choose how you'd like to cut it up and eat. I sat at the sushi bar area and happened to notice that the sill of the bar was so dusty, but that was halfway through my meal. It was too late to move or have them wipe it for the risk of anything getting into my dish. Other than that little hiccup, the food was good and the service for lunch was just okay, nothing stellar."
"I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and another couple. We came at 6:30 expecting somewhat of a crowd considering that it was happy hour until 7 pm. The restaurant is directly across the street for Jin, which also has a similar deal. This place is smaller, newer, and I think a bit more trendy in decor. The specials are similar, though slightly better. We ordered: Pepper tuna - tasty but nothing special Salmon avocado roll - really delicious, the salmon was amazingly fresh Cream cheese wontons - good but not a great value at 4 tiny wontons for $3.50 Veggie gyoza - 6 herby, delicious dumplings that were quite filling Veggie fried rice - a smaller portion (one entire small rice bowl filled to the top), buttery and tasty - a little too rich for my taste Sweet potato tempura roll - exactly what you'd expect The food was good, nothing amazing, but a pretty good value. They also had $10 Sapporo pitchers, which kept us there a bit longer than we expected! I think we'll add this to our list of places to return as they also allow BYOB (one per table, wine only, NO BEER!)"
"I was not particularly impressed with the food at the restaurant, especially given the crazed atmosphere. We had cauliflower that was slightly undone and not too interesting. The kale salad, however, was simple but good and plentiful. We liked the excellent fish and creamed spinach -but I would try a different place next time."
Only thing I order here is half of the Country Style Duck to go. I love the picked relish it comes with and the vinegary sauce to dip the duck in is FAB-U-LOUS! The duck here is better flavored than Chao Zhao in Flushing and a wee bit better than New Chao Chow on Mott Street.
"Came for pre-broadway dinner. This place is a cave! But for what counts, that doesn't matter because it's a nice underground izakaya hidden in a overly-tourist-trodden neighborhood. Actually, this place looks to be a local yuppie haven. The takoyaki was tasty, with more octopus per cubic cm of ball I've eaten before. The balls are nice and melty. The noodles with spicy cod roe cream sauce was addicting. A popular dish we and every table around us ordered: the fried chicken; it's crispy, meshing lightly with shredded daikon and soy sauce. The major disappointment was the service and turnaround time. We and each table around us commiserated; plates come 1-2 at a time, 20-30 minutes apart. Often, people cancel orders just so they can get the check and go. This may be why they're always crowded. Prices are not bad for the quality and location of the restaurant; it's only a bit more wallet than those at St. Marks."
"Sorry to be the first non-5 star review here - I think there might be quality control issues with brunch vs. dinner. Â We went for brunch and it was just fine. Â Not great but fine. Â I had the steak and eggs and asked for it medium rare but came out medium well, boo for that. Â But the eggs were great and it was served with yummy rice and beans. Â And brunch comes with coffee (which wasn't great) and a drink - I had a bloody mary (which was very good.) Â The bloody mary was served with an asparagus stalk rather than celery which was a nice change, but they were out of straws, which was annoying. The price for brunch (food, coffee, drink) was $14.95, which was decent but not great for what you get. Before the meal, rather than serving bread, little cornmeal cheezy balls appeared on the table, which were good and fresh and warm. Â Served with butter and marmalade - I found the idea of putting marmalade on a corny-cheezy ball to be kinda weird. Also kinda weird is that we had to ask for all utensils. Â I think the staff was kinda distracted by the football match that was being aired live on Univision while we were there. Â Which would be awesome if you are a fan, they have a big projector screen in the back. The atmosphere is pretty awesome actually - it's super tiny inside, and really feels like you've stepped into an authentic cafe in South America. Â It's very un-Williamsburgy, which is nice. Â Unfortunately, at brunch time on a summer day, it was uncomfortably hot in there. Â I'll go back for dinner for sure when it's less hot out and the food is presumably better."
"I lived in Singapore for 10 years and moved to the states 2 years ago. I missed the local food so much- until I found Nyonya! Â The restaurant delivers authentic Malay/Singaporean dishes, and the chicken rice hits home every time. Other favorite dishes you have to try that have satisfied my home cravings: stingray (a must try), string beans with shrimp, beef rendang (so tender and juicy), and meegoreng noodles. DONT order Singaporean noodles if you want authenticity- there is no such thing in Singapore. Overall a great eat for very reasonable prices. Weekends are always packed so try to go a bit early. Reservations are only for parties of 6+."
"I love this place . It is not always consistent but the quality goes from good to exceptional. Last night I went with four people and had (from top to bottom in terms of tastiness): vegetarian red curry, sweet green curry with beef, tom kha gai (coconut soup with chicken), som tam (spicy green papaya salad), stir-fried chicken with cashews and pineapple, and pork larb. We also had singha (classic) and beerlao (one of my fav beers in the world- its finally making inroads in nyc, and I just hope more thai places get the light and the dark lager)."
"For high class italian dining without breaking the bank, this is the place to be (okay, and also Becco in the Theatre District). This is great for a date night or a catch up with an old friend. This place was recommended to me for it's bolognese, but I would also suggest their seafood. Here are the highlights: + Meatball appetizer - tender and flavorful meat with the perfect tomato sauce + Tagliatelle - great bolognese sauce with bits of carrots - light yet flavorful, and portion is just enough to fill you up, but not too much...I'm in love with Becco's bolognese sauce, and while this place may not be better, it is a bit lighter with more of a tomato presence to it + Branzino - delicious sea bass; also light and flavorful Olive Oil gelati - I was hesitant about this one at first, but it came out quite nice (would recommend it for it's uniqueness)"
"Cafe Orlin, you disappoint me. I've had fond memories of you when I used to be a tourist but after coming back, you left a bitter (not sour-I can handle tart) taste in my mouth. Â Was the good experience all but a dream? We started with 2 appetizers: 1) The vegetarian dish which came with hummus, rice pilaf, baba ghanoush, Â Tabbouleh and 2) grilled calamari with arugula salad. The vegetarian appetizer was good; the hummus had a hint of citrus, the rice pilaf was steamed well, the eggplants had a smoky taste, and the tabbouleh had a nice minty after taste. Â Kudos Â to the grilled calamari- nicely seasoned and cooked well (it was plump and juicy). However, things started going downhill afterwards. My friends and I ordered different dishes: Â Braised beef, lamb burger, Sea Bass, and a side of broccoli with mushrooms. The lamb burger was situated in a pita bread with according to my friends, ""not so great"" fries. Â The fries looked soggy and didn't have that crispness to it. Â My friends also noticed it lacked any sauce on the sandwich. Â Now, I can't vouch whether having the tahani white sauce adds authenticity to a Mediterranean dish (or whether it's a concoction of American culture), BUT, I can vouch for services rendered. Â First, my friends asked the waiter for sauce. Â Instead we got hot sauce. Â Ok, benefit of the doubt, we'll try again. Â This time, we called for one seems to be one of the Managers (she was standing in the front overseeing the restaurant). Â We asked her for ""white sauce"" to accompany the lamb burger. Â ""We don't carry white sauce,"" she rudely answers while rolling her eyes. ""Tahini sauce?,"" we asked. Â Yes, they carry Tahini sauce but not white sauce. Â Aren't they the same? Normally, I don't let service get in my way of good food (but if the food is mediocre or average at best, service is then a deal-breaker). Â Again, I want to have the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the term ""white sauce"" is not as commonly used in more fancier places (and only in carts/fast food joints) but her execution in delivering the service was horrible. Â We were livid in how we were treated. I had a bite of my friend's beef brisket. Â The meat did not flake nicely. Â It was overcooked and chewy and did not go down smoothly. The sea bass was decent; the fish was cooked nicely as it flaked off easily with the fork. However, the ""Mediterranean"" sauces were lacking and my fish was a bit bland. I've had better. I also ordered a side of broccoli with mushrooms. Â Not sure how people like to eat their vegetables, but I like them not overly cooked. Â If it's too cooked, all the vitamins and nutritious benefits of eating those green vegetables are lost. Â These broccolis were Â so overcooked they were soft and mushy. Â Flavor was bland and tasted like it was boiled too long in the pot. Â The mushrooms did not enhance the dish at all; it was lacking that earthy, savory taste. While my party had a good time with each other's company, the dining experience was a different story. Â Sure, every restaurant has their off days in the quality of the food but no restaurant should demean their customers. And coming from a guy who has lots of patience, this really irked me."
how can you NOT like this place? the best fries i've ever had (in cali OR nyc). but i guess you have an advantage when you fry your potatoes in shortening. haha. i LOVE that you get free samples - it makes it a quickie and fun stop for visiting out of towners. my favorites are the curry ketchup and the parmesan peppercorn. yum! not much room to sit - and the seats that ARE there are coated with thin layers of grease and grime. get it to go!
"A place with great staff who treat you special when you cross the threshold of the door. This establishment has a drink or food event for everyday of the week just pick a day. If you drag Mondays as I do then start of with margarita Monday and begin with the margarita lab. This concoction is blended just right, cooled to give you a brain freeZe! It really reminds me of a place in Cancun Mexico. There menu is full of authentic Latin taste which you will be sure to enjoy. I enjoyed the Lancaster chicken which is so tender and moist. However the Ensenada fish tacos are my favorite choice. I know they use beer batter but the way they melt in your mouth I could care what beer it is cause........ Ooo it's so good"
"I can't believe that I haven't been to this place before, especially because it's so close to where I live. Â Upon arrival we were greeted by energetic and friendly staff. Â I felt actually important ! Â That is how I like to feel when I go into a business! YES! I've never had Lebanese food, so I had a lot of stupid questions -- though the staff weren't giving us attitude because of that. Â PLUS! For appetizer we had the spinach pie, which I LOVED LOVED LOVED. Â I am a sucker for spinach and the spinach was perfect with the pomegranate juice. Â Who knew, right? Â The juice balanced the bitterness of the vegetable really well and the dough wasn't tough. Â You can tell it was hand-crafted! Â  We ordered the Combination platter with the lamb SHAWERMA and the Kefta Kebab for 25.95 which also comes with rice with lentils and hummus (two sides). Â Omgosh!!! The lamb shawerma was so delicious. Â There was no lamb piece without flavor. Â I actually could have done without the kefta kebab though -- it didn't look very appetizing and it was really mushy and salty. Â Meh. Â The rice with lentils and hummus were also favorites of mine. Â We also got free pita for our hummus, along with some white sauce for our meats. I was content and full!!! Â Delicious. Â Will definitely come back here again. Â I'm so happy to find little gems of Queens!!!"
"Amazing amazing amazing. We always go to the carry out around the corner, as the restaurant is always super full with a 45 minute wait. Â You must try the Cuban sandwiches with the grilled corn. Omg amazing! And they have Mexican coke too:)"
"Came here last night is search of a cheap dinner. I ordered the house special noodle soup (knife cut) and my friend and I shared an order of dumplings. The dumplings were great, flavorful and just the right amount of filling per dumpling. Â The noodles were good, the knife cut is most likely a machine knife because it was too uniformed to be hand cut by a knife. They were just the right amount of chewiness. I like the dumplings more than I like the noodles but I will definitely be back."
"Such a great place to get brunch. They have good portions (you won't leave stuffed but you won't leave hungry either) for a decent brunch price (~15 without tax/tip). I ordered the egg white scramble, which was delicious -- eggs perfectly cooked with a tasty combination of caramelized onions, roasted mushrooms, and gruyere. There was literally half of an avocado on the side, so that was a nice bonus! My friend ordered the eggs with style, which for him was 2 scrambled eggs, toast, a potato pancake, and chicken sausage. He was a big fan of the food. Will definitely drop by in the future if I'm looking for brunch! Love the ambience, too."
"I like Shanghainese food enough to bring dishonor on my Sichuanese family. There is something so compelling about rice cakes with preserved vegetables, juicy soup dumplings, fried buns, etc. I suppose I just like the combination of refined carbs + meat. In any case, Shanghai Asian Manor does Shanghainese fare decently well. The place is pretty popular, so getting a table for large groups can sometimes be challenging. I went with a group of 6 once for dinner on a Saturday evening and waited a good forty-five minutes for a table. Recently, I went in a party of two at around 8PM on a Monday evening and the wait was only about five minutes. No fluff, just solid Shanghainese fare. The rice cakes with pork and preserved vegetables is yummy. The salt and pepper squid came with an interesting mayo-based dressing that certainly isn't authentic but did add some additional flavor to the fare. The friend buns were yummy and not too fried, which I appreciated. Though the food isn't as amazing as Shanghai CafÃ© and the price point is a tad higher with a longer wait, I'm giving Shanghai Asian Manor another star because the bathrooms are clean and the service is reasonably friendly. This makes it quite a find in Chinatown, as long as you don't mind the wait!"
You don't have to even ask me twice if I want Dinosaur BBQ because the answer will be yes! Ive always loved Dino BBQ. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. Only this time I noticed that the food was not as on point as it used to be. Some things were a hit and some things were a miss. The chicken wings are amazing!!! The deviled eggs and the ribs were good as well but I was not too crazy about my main course. I ordered 2 pork sliders with a side of mac n' cheese and the Harlem potato salad. I really hate to say that I was disappointed because I really do like this place but its the truth. The pork was pretty bland the mac n' cheese was not very cheesy and the potato salad was not good either. Im not quiet sure where things went wrong here but the food has decreased in flavor. I cant say that I'll be running back here but I will still be rooting for Dino BBQ hope they can change things back to the way they used to be!
"Really solid tapas with very friendly and helpful staff, interesting specials, and reasonable prices. Â Surprisingly, it's still flying below most people's radar... Tough to get a table (finally made it in on my 3rd attempt). Â We were lucky to get a table outside with no wait on a Thursday night so I enjoyed looking in at the cozy inside without suffering the claustrophobia. Nice Spanish wine list (I'm not picky with my Rioja). Â Shrimp & serrano mushrooms had an interesting texture and great flavor, the meatballs had a very nice sauce, the lobster puff pastry (special) was awesome, duck sausage skewers really played well with the pearl onions, and the croquettes were recommended by the table just inside the window. Â I'm getting hungry so I guess I should add that 5th star."
"My favorite place in LIC! I wish it were a little cheaper, but it is definitely delish! Get the guac!"
"Is it just me or was it really awesome and delicious years ago but now it's still good as a late late lateeeee night option but not quite the same? Regardless, white sauce all the wayy! And if you haven't realized from the other posts, this is probably not the place to go if you're counting calories. Just sayin'."
"Solid choice for Thai in Midtown West. Â I've dined in once at the restaurant and gotten delivery many, many times. Â Larb Ubol offers fairly authentic Thai food at a very reasonable price. Â You can have entrees under $10 for lunch and dinner here - where else in the city can you get a deal like that? Â McDonald's? They serve the widest variety of som tum (papaya salad) I've seen at any other Thai place. Â Though not as crispy as I would like the green papaya to be, they serve up some solid and SPICY (real Thai spicy, not wimpy Thai spicy like other places), authentic, legit som tum. Â Som tum here is a tad more expensive than at other Thai joints, but you get your money's worth for sure. For entrees, I usually hit up their noodle soups or meat over rice. Â They give you a lot of food, even when it's for delivery/take out. Â My favorite of the bunch has been the Kra Prao Moo Krob over rice - translated to basil sauce with a choice of protein. Â Go for the crispy pork - proper crispy/crunchy and a good amount of meat. Â Basil sauce has great flavor as well. Â Yen Ta Fo and Guay Thiew Tom Yum noodle soups are solid as well. Â  Have not had any of the long list of larbs they sell, but will try it sometime when I return!"
"It was a long wait and that was expected. As long as you are standing with good company, the wait isn't too bad. They did misjudge our wait time by more than 45 minutes so that was slightly annoying. Overall the service was okay and the space was extremely tight. There's only one bathroom so the line build up behind it so while you are eating, there's a line of people standing behind you along the wall waiting to use the bathroom. Not exactly appetizing but that's NYC for you. Of the food we ordered, the best was indeed the pancakes. Thankfully they were my mine and I enjoyed every bite of my blueberry pancakes (I did share a bit though, promise) My sister ordered a variety of sides and they were all forgettable and bland. My brother had salmon with eggs with a side salad. Â My brother cleaned his plate so he must have enjoyed it. We both ordered milkshakes and they were delicious. Cash only! My sister said next time, we'll come for dinner to have the pancakes and not have to wait as long. Breakfast for dinner sounds great in my book especially if I can avoid a two hour+ line."
"5 stars on the food + 5 stars on the service. I have no qualms about that. My man and I were there for lunch and our server Syed deserves the award for server of the year at Bouley. He was extremely attentive, friendly, and yet professional. We chatted and when he found out we were from Chicago, he must have told the kitchen about it because lo and behold, we received 3 complimentary courses in addition to our 5-course tasting menu for lunch. Man, were we stuffed but the food was excellently executed and delicate that we were extremely grateful for Bouley's generosity. Sometimes when going for a multiple course meal, not every dish might be executed as well as the others but it wasn't the case during our experience at Bouley. Syed also saw that we had our camera with us and suggested that he help us take a picture, once before lunch and once again after lunch. For the shot before lunch, he was trying to help us get the perfect shot from the perfect angle. When the kitchen staff arrived at the table with our amuse bouche, Syed told the kitchen staff ""Hold on, I'm trying to take a picture"", and to which the kitchen staff just stood there while holding our plates and waiting for Syed to perfect his photographic shot of my husband and I. It was quite hilarious especially when the kitchen staff joked about Syed, ""He thinks he's a good photographer but he's not"". We ordered wine and the French sommelier (yes, with an authentic French accent) was extremely helpful in articulating the wine recommendations based on our preference for the types of wines. I was deciding between the French Chardonnay and German Riesling and finally decided on the Chardonnay but the sommelier still very kindly let me taste the Riesling when he brought out my Chardonnay. Come April 2012, it will mark Syed's 10-year employment at Bouley. I think this is a reflection of Bouley as a very well-run place since in the service industry, it is very common to have a high turn over rate of staff. As we got up from our table, Syed even walked us out to the entrance and told us about the ancient ceiling and door fixtures used at Bouley. The very old wooden door leading to the dining room was brought in from Paris, we were told. Bouley is deserving of it's 1 Michelin Star that's for sure. Their 5-course lunch menu for $55 (weekdays + weekends) is a very good deal that no one should miss!"
"When I heard that we were getting an American Flatbread in NYC, I was excited. Â Very excited. You see, whenever I'm in Vermont visiting friends, a stop off in AF Burlington is practically mandatory. American Flatbread is a well-established culinary delight in Vermont. Â Their shtick is locally sourced artisanal toppings on top of hearth-cooked bread. Awesome ingredients, awesome flatbread (read: Pizza), awesome bar with in-house brews. Â They definitely have a good thing going with a reasonable price to match. I was doubly excited about the prospects of Flatbread Brunch, one of the amazing offerings up in Vermont... But back to earth (ie, NYC). I went to AF for brunch on a Sunday morning, around 11:30 am. The place was empty, and the space was beautiful. Definitely has more of an industrial Tribeca vibe than a crunchy Vermont vibe. The service was attentive and friendly, and the staff seemed great at accommodating larger groups and kids which trickled in while we dined. AF being noteworthy for delicious bloody marys, I ordered one and it was FANTASTIC. However, I was a bit disappointed that the Eggs Benedict Flatbread served weekends in Burlington was not on the menu (and when I asked the waiter if they had it on a brunch menu, he had no idea what I was talking about...). Really, you need some eggs to legitimize eating fresh pizza at 11:30 am a Sunday. And it is one of the draws up in VT, so after mentioning it to the staff, I'm hoping that they will bring it onto the menu in the near future. So instead we ate the new vermont sausage pizza and the pepperoni/peppers pizza. The sausage flatbread was awesome, the pepperoni was in the 3-star range - not enough cheese and the pepperoni itself was one of the weirdest driest pepperonis I've ever consumed. It felt more like tempeh bruschetta than a cheesy flatbread. Giving 4 stars, hoping they can bring in the brunch menu."
"Ahhhh Pio Pio, the mini chain. I have no problems with that, but when things other then chicken are added to the menu, it's really not the same. You see, Pio had a cult following because it's chicken is NO JOKE! Once it became a mini chain, the menu expanded. Today, I ventured in the UWS Pio and was happy with the atmosphere. I noticed the changed in the menu and decided to try the shrimp chuza. The dish was great. The shrimp were well sized with great taste and the rice had corn, tomato and onions, a nice combo. My issue with the dish? I ate it in 5 minutes. I was still hungry. I left wanting a cheeseburger or something. It was a small portion. I recommend Pio Pio to anyone, but I'd stick with the chicken. It's incredible and leaves you nice and full and wanting a bed to curl up in."
"The meats here for BBQ are mouth wateringly good. In my opinion the meats are in par with gyu kaku. I came here with my family for dinner and everyone left satisfied. Though the only con is the walk in wait time, make reservations."
"This place has very interesting (and delicious) cocktails for a reasonable price. My husband and I both had a Cucumber Collins, which at $8 each, was pretty well prices, especially considering that you would easily pay $12 or $13 for the same thing in Manhattan. The service was friendly and I loved the decor, with rustic wooden tables and a chalkboard behind the bar. My friend ordered some kind of rootbeer cocktail, which he raved about all night, and his girlfriend ordered a ""pickletini"", which is exactly what it sounds like: a martini with pickle juice, which I probably would have loved to try if I weren't already a few drinks deep. All in all, I think this is a great little place to go out for a few drinks with friends in a cozy atmosphere."
"Great burrito! Â I'm a big fan of Chipotle, and I find most people who try the same style of burrito (where you pick your ingredients and they make it on the spot), just do a poor job. Â This place is definitely an exception though. Â It had a distinctly different flavor than Chipotle, and the change was really nice. Â Often when I've tried other places who do this style, they are just really lacking in flavor."
"Absolutely amazing! We had the Thanksgiving prix fixe and between the four of us we each ordered a different entree and shared. They were all exquisite. My favorite was the butternut squash soup with ricotta dumplings. Not only was the food wonderful, every employee--from the hostess, to the bartenders and the servers--were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I have seldom been as impressed with a restaurant as I was with Rye. It made a great occasion perfect and I truly appreciated it and Â was so happy with my decision to have dinner there with our guests rather than cook."
"Yeah, I ate at Walter last night, so what? Â  So I ordered some crab and artichoke dip and meant to share it with my date but I ended up eating the whole thing, big deal. What do you care if I had two beers with my meal? Â One before and one during? Â You think that makes me a drunk or something because I thought the beers were delicious? Â  And yeah...yeah, I ordered some Alaskan halibut and, yes, it was covered with anchovies. Â Does that make me some kind of pig? Â Does the fact that I scooped up all of the olive dressing and ate it with my fingers without washing my hands first make me less of a man. Â Maybe I even licked the plate afterwards because I didn't want to stop tasting it yet....does that make me a fatty? Â WELL EXCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME! Â  I'm not the one on trial here."
Food was great! my portion was small.. could have eaten another item.
good food!!
"You shouldn't eat this sober, but drunk at 4am makes it a godsend. Â You will burn the skin on the inside of your mouth from the sauce, but it's worth it (until you wake up in pain the next morning)."
Stopped in here just to check it out & ended up splitting a #4 with my gf. Pork & pÃ¢tÃ©. Very fresh & tasty sandwich. Sizable. Only $4.25. Will be back.
"I love these kinds of restaurants--good, solid food that comes in appropriate intervals, attentive service, and a great atmosphere where I can just enjoy myself and my company for however long I want to without feeling rushed. Yakitori Totto really made for an enjoyable night. Although the bill adds up and can get quite expensive, I think everything is pretty reasonably priced considering how each yakitori stick was extremely good. Just because it's on a stick doesn't mean it should automatically be cheap. Each yakitori stick is done right and treated with care and delicateness and the results show--very much unlike Yakitori Taisho. BF & I came here on a Friday night around 9 and only had to wait for around 10 minutes for a seat. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar over a table. The yakitori cooks will hand you your dish directly; plus it's fun watching them cook; plus they're kinda cute haha. Sadly, there were no more knee bone or neck or chicken oysters available by the time we were seated but everything else we ordered was very very good. The kawa (skin) and harami steak were probably the best. The spicy negi tori don was really really good too. Dessert was a pleasant surprise. They have frozen banana in a coconut milk with sago. So refreshing! And the ice cream dessert with hot green tea was very very good too. We'll definitely be coming back."
"Addictive lay spicy, super delicious cuisine from the region around Xi'an, China, where the flavors of lamb and cumin are both very popular. Their hand-cut noodles are legendary, but I always get the spicy cumin lamb burger, which is a steal at $3.50. Tiger vegetable salad and spicy cucumber salad help balance the meat- heavy menu, and cool you down a bit, too. This place is one of my all-time favorites in NYC."
"Im very stingy and I don't like giving 5 stars but Â this place deserves it. Great Service, Great Food, Great Sangria. So im giving them 5 start and 2 thumbs up"
No doubt Prosperity over Vanessa's. Best 1$ you can spend. Don't keep the box closed for long if you're taking it to go. Best to eat the dumplings right away or they'll get soggy. Not for the faint of heart and snooty fine diners. Cause this is a real hole in the wall.
"Very good tapas-style Japanese food. Highlights were the avocado tuna dish and the grilled skirt steak. The menu could use some more variety outside of fried options, but everything was pretty good. Both pork belly dishes we ordered left something to be desired. Overall we were all very pleased. Service was efficient and friendly. The restaurant is very small, though. Not a place to just walk in and expect a quick table."
"This place is adorable. I had a very romantic dinner here at the bar, the food and the wine were all delicious. The atmosphere is what you want out of a restaurant. The bartender/ waiter was helpful while giving us space. It is a pretty small space. Sitting at the bar actually felt like it gave me more room."
"changed my mind! i had an absolutely delicious dinner here with a really nice waitress. i'm going again tonight. if it's as good as last time, of course i won't be writing again."
"Heard good things, so while I was in the area I decided to pop-in and see what's what. Â First off, the layout is a bit odd...I thought this was a place that had pastry and also served meals, but I only saw maybe two tables. Â There appeared to be a 'sunroom' or something further back but it wasn't clear if that was an empty storage room back there or if there were actual seats back there. Â The layout isn't exactly inviting enough that I felt inclined to just walk back there (this, on a very quite Saturday around 400p when I just saw a person at the bar and two people at a table in back). The pastries behind the bar is also a bit odd feeling...to order pastry from over a 'bar' versus from behind a traditional pastry counter. The person behind the bar ...not sure if they were just distracted or what...but not super friendly service...a bit 'cool'... I got an almond croissant. It was good. Â Wouldn't say it was stellar."
"For those ""How I Met Your Mother"" fans, this would be my ""MacLaren's"". That is if I actually lived above this bar. Alas, I live two subway stops away. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying a few here on a semi regular basis. This place is pretty much what I look for in a bar. Cozy, chill, and no frills, yet not a dive bar. The beer selection is great. I like to sample every beer on their menu, so I can't really say which I prefer. I'm really bad at remembering names. They have a seasonal cask ale, which is always great to check out. The food is a step above your average bar food fare. The fried pickles are pretty darn good considering I am not normally a fan of pickles. At one point my friend ordered the portobello burger thinking it would be a portobello atop an actual burger, only to find out it was just the mushroom. We ate it anyway, and though I am quite the carnivore, I loved it. The meat burger is pretty darn good as well. The mac & cheese though can be a little on the soupy side. Overall this is a great place to meet with a few friends after work or a good lowkey Saturday night. Now all I got to do is work on scoring that apartment right next door."
"I was setup for failure by having my first meal at Parker and Quinn while visiting NYC . Â Every inch of space had a purpose as decor and functional space. Â You can't go wrong with wherever you sit in this restaurant. Â I had a few rounds of gin and whiskey cocktails and all were very delicious. Â  As for the food, damn, probably the best rib eye I've ever had. Â The steak was charred to a perfect medium rare grilled over hickory smoke with a reduction sauce. Â You have to order this. Â From what I hear a boxer came in everyday and had three servings a day for this steak. Â I also hear it's better than Keens. Â We ordered ours sliced to share with the group and everyone was like g'damn! Â Stuffed peppers with shredded beef had me going. Â The spicy meatballs had me scooping up the sauce. Â And the Octopus salad was super tender, more so than many places that I can recall. And after you're done with this awesome meal make your way up to the roof top bar. Â The refinery hotel definitely has a lot going for it with this restaurant and the menu created by Jeffrey Forrest (you may have seen him on chopped). Â This is a festive restaurant bar so unless you're sitting up on the high tables expect the noise which for me just adds to the experience."
"After talking to my Fillipino friend about Fillipino food yesterday, I was in the mood for Fillipino food. Came here with my gf on a Thursday night at around 9:30pm. It was a busier than I had anticipated. The hostess was friendly, greeted us at the door and told us that all tables were booked at least 10pm, so we opt to sit on the wall (they tables bar tables along the wall.) We had the arroz caldo, bulalo hash, and chori burger with a San Miguel beer. Arroz Caldo - similar to any other Asian congee (or rice porridge) with a soft boiled egg and fried tripe. - Delicious with a spritz of lemon juice. Bulalo hash - a soup stew with a couple of pieces of very tender beef, some vegetables, and a large helping of bone marrow right from the bone. - Being of Asian descent, this dish reminded me of a home cooked meal. It really hit the spot. The beef was very tender and flavorful and if you appreciated the rich fattiness of bone marrow, you will not be disappointed. Chori burger - this was one of the biggest, juicest, yummiest burger I have ever had. I was barely able to finish the entree and I usually have a big appetite. There were parties eating Kamayan dinner, which is family style without utensils. Looked really interesting, I would like to come back to try that one day, along with the Baluuuut! Service: 4/5 Food: 5/5 Decor: 3.5/5 (place was very cramped and dark) Would I come back? Hell Yes Oh yes, CASH ONLY"
"This place is a bit over-hyped and as with many hip NYC spots, over-priced. We started with iced coffee, OJ and a scone. All A-OK. The scone, in fact, was the bomb, one of the best I've had. Then we ordered the large bloody mary and the cocktail with Pimms, lemon...I can't entirely remember. All good. This is basically where the good experience ends. I can see the menu protocol is much debated here. Personally, I'm not that into it simply because I can't ever read the waitresses handwriting. I also like to seriously peruse a menu before I order and that's just not possible here. It's a bit of a guessing game and since the waitresses here aren't really into customer servicing, you kind of just have to pick something and see what comes out. Granted though it's a novel set-up. For actual brunch we ordered the Poached Eggs with Corn Succotash and then the Duck Confit Hash with a sunny egg on top. When I order something written only on the menu/table as the ""Duck"" dish, I'm expecting to eat some duck. It comes out and we literally have to fish around the dish to find a few shreds of duck--about a spoonful in an already small-portioned dish. The rest of the hash had roasted potatoes, leeks and mushrooms with a sunny egg that was, in my opinion, overcooked (where I come from sunny eggs are still pretty runny, but maybe everyone has a different take on that?). Basically, we paid $14 for an overcooked sunny side egg and a few handfuls of roasted veggies with basically a garnish of duck confit. The Poached Eggs with Corn Succotash was similar. I will hand it to them, they were 2 perfectly poached eggs--kudos. The ""Succotash"" was basically a spoonful of corn and about 4 yellow cherry tomatoes, served with two slices of toast, one of which was entirely charred. The waitress did come by and say ""So sorry, do you want me to get you more toast?"" I declined because I was already a bit put-off and didn't want to interact with the staff or else show my disdain. But I've worked in restaurants for nearly 10 years. When you notice the cook messed-up, and the runner I suppose failed to notice the burnt toast, you don't offer to fix it, you just do it. That's what customer service is all about. And I mean...it's toast. She could have picked up a few more slices in the amount of time it took her to ask if I wanted more. Granted, I guess some people really like burnt toast. This dish was $11. Two poached eggs with basically a handful of corn and tomato and some burnt toast. The meal total was $65 plus another $10 for tip. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon...or ever. For the record though, my boyfriend had a great experience at one of Diner's sister restaurants Roman's. I've also heard great things about Marlow & Sons. This was my second time at Diner, the last time was over two years ago. I've given them two chances. With those price points, I wouldn't recommend it."
"There aren't even words for how awful the service was. It took forty five minutes from the time we sat down to get our food. Our server couldn't bother to bring us a thing (like our drinks). He never talked to us or asked us how we were or checked on us at any point. Nothing. It's a miracle he even took our order. The pancakes were alright. Not bad. Not great. Certainly not worth any kind of wait. The only redeeming thing about the entire experience was the sugar cured bacon which was really amazing, but not enough to outweigh everything else that was terrible about this place."
The drinks the food everything was so refreshing and filled with flavor! The margaritas were perfectly done. I'm still dreaming about the arepas and I haven't been here in a year!!!!
"I was pretty impressed by the extent of the sauce selection for the fries. It's very cool that they let you try pretty much as many different sauces that you want. I got the Mexican spicy sauce which was excellent, and the mango Vietnamese sauce which was also very good."
"Traif is now open Monday nights for a relaxed feel, cocktail focused evening. Â The menu offers about 20 cocktails and food ($6-14) are all bite/tapas style. It's their night to show off their passion for cocktails and get a bit more creative with food. Â It's amazing how Traif never disappoints. Check it out :) No rest for this amazing team..."
"Brunch review! We came on a chilly Saturday around noon and had no wait (we must have just beat the rush because I saw quite the line of diners waiting towards the end of our meal). Service was good..no complaints, though I'm not sure how attentive they can be when the place is packed. It's definitely small..you may be squished next to people who want to discuss their job, family drama, importance, etc..I didn't care. Â I was there for the brunch. My food. Â OMG. Â Hands down, the dish to get is the Basque Scramble. Â That combination of chorizo, perfectly cooked and seasoned polenta, avocado purÃ©e, salsa..all of it..such a delicious combo. Â  Took a look at the cocktail menu but was pacing myself for later in the day and did not order anything. Â Definitely not a bottomless brunch spot, but I would try a cocktail or two here. Â  I tried the guy's Monte Cristo sandwich and it was tasty. Â I would definitely return to try their dinner menu and see how it measures up to my brunch experience."
"I loved my meatballs! i had chicken meatballs with the parmesean sauce topped with some other white cheese i forget now. but my meal was amazing!!! my boyfriend had the beef meatballs with some red sauce. his tasted like there should have been some spaghetti underneath it. nothing to write home to mom about. he really loved his veggies that came with it tho. Mine had some odd salad type thing that i wasn't too fond of. When i visit NYC again, i'll stop by again."
"food was so so. remember ordering salad. atmosphere is nice and service. outdoor patio is nice, but overall is ok tone thats y 3 stars."
"Spicy Buffalo Chicken meatballs smothered in blue cheese?! Hell YEAH!!! $&. The side of risotto and shitake was outstanding, just sick awesome. $4. We also split the classic beef with parm cheese Heroe ($9), the baguette was super crisp on the outside, and warm on the inside and the beef meatball with parm was perfectly seasoned. We couldn't resist the dessert and split the brownie with espresso ice cream (made in house). It was HUGE for $4. The espresso ice cream is some of the best I've ever had, I love the grainy beans in there. For the price and the taste this place get's a 5 star. They lose one star for Â the greasiness of the balls, *chuckles, as well as the disclaimer on the bottom of the menu that all meatballs are using some pork."
"3.5 stars but rounded down, cause nothing really perturbed me to round up. Â  Fantastic cauliflower soup that is supposed to be a special, but is it a special if it has been on the menu every time i come here? Have had a few of the pastas, the vegetable tower platter, and desserts. Â Always a safe, casual place to go. Â Best thing to get there is the sausage risotto, however the other dishes can't really hold a candle. Â  Pretty good value though at about $15-$25 per person."
"Very solid brunch spot! Based on previous yelp reviews, I ordered the huevos rancheros and was not disappointed! My friends all got either the brisket hash or the poached eggs and their portions were a lot smaller than mine (or mine was bigger than theirs) so I was really stuffed afterwards! I had the BLT bloody mary as well, which was spicier than most bloody mary's, but I like them that way. The place was full on a Sunday morning so I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you can."
"Cafecito es me favorito!! Â Ok...it sounded cooler in my head. Anyway, I went to Cafecito with some friends. Â It was our first meal of the day...and of the year! Â =) Â It was already 7pm. Â We were STARVING!!! Before I get into the details of the delicious food, my 5 stars is also based on the customer service. I felt like the employees were ""real"" and not just working for the tip. Â The place seemed homey and the waiter was very personable. I could probably spend the whole day there, sipping my sangria or margarita, and just chattin' it up! On to the food! We ordered the ceviche, calamari, picadillo, sea bass, and another pork dish that I can't remember. Anyway, everything was DELICIOUS!!! The ceviche had generous chunks of fish. Â The plantain chips that came with it were a great complement to the ceviche. Â  The calamari had fried chorizo. Â That was a very pleasant and DELICIOUS surprise! Â I love chorizo!!! Picadillo was great too. Â I had picadillo before that was greasy, but this one wasn't. Â  Sea bass was also very meaty. Â I have yet to taste a see a sea bass gone wrong! Â  The only item I wasn't thrilled about were the plantains. Â I'm not sure if I just got undercooked ones, but I like mine crispy and sweet. Â Maybe the plantain they used in the batch I ate weren't ripe enough. Â Anyway, that didn't really affect my review because I still think this small gem deserves 5 stars. Â  I'll definitely be back! Â I'm very excited to try the brunch!"
"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time with a friend of ours on a recent Saturday night. Our friend had warned us that we would need to arrive when it opened in order to avoid a long wait, so we showed up at 6. Little did we know that people start putting their names on the list well before they open at 6, so there was already a 2-hour wait when we arrived. We were shocked, but put our name and number in anyway and headed off to a nearby bar to kill time. Still no call by 8, but we headed back anyway to see what was what. We were told that they were waiting for a 3-top to pay, and we would be next. Another 30 minutes elapsed (fortunately it was nice out, so sitting outside to wait wasn't a big deal), and we were finally in! At this point, we were so hungry that we all felt like the food better be amazing in order to justify the wait time. Our friend looked around and noticed that some people were eating meatballs, which weren't on the menu. He asked the server about them, and she said they were something people had ordered off the menu. We asked if we could try one, and she reported there was one left and it was ours. I realize it was just a meatball, but let me tell you, this was probably the best meatball we had ever eaten (along with the marinara sauce and basil). As we were scarfing it down, the chef came over to ask what we thought. He was thinking of putting it on the menu officially and wanted feedback. Needless to say, we had nothing but good things to say about it. We ordered two pizzas--one with pepperoni and mushrooms and the other with artichoke hearts, garlic, and basil. If you order two or more pies (at a small table), they bring them one after the other. The pepperoni and mushroom came first, and it was truly delicious. We all agreed that it made the wait worthwhile. The second pizza was just as good. There were only three of us, but we finished both pizzas. They're very thin, and not as filling as you might expect, so I would recommend ordering more than you think you need. To sum up: yes, the wait is interminable, but if you plan for that and know that your meal will be worth the wait, you won't be disappointed. This is definitely the best brick oven pizza I've ever had."
"The food was always good but the service has pissed me off for the last time. I have to wonder if they are homophobic since the only times I've ever had a problem here was when I was with my boyfriend. Today we go to sit at a table and the guy behind the counter says someone has spoken for it, yet they don't take reservations, he still gave the table to some tourists when we're in there all the time. The visit last week they gave me day old bread hard as a rock while the other 3 tables had soft fresh bread. Screw Pepe Rosso. I can get every bit as good food and pasta but with good service and at a better price all over Brooklyn."
"This place accomplishes what relatively few NYC restaurants can claim to master: delicious, chic and affordable. Stumbled in here with a friend visiting the city who was intent on having Thai food. The restaurant itself has an upscale vibe and really makes you forget you're right off of second ave - definitely a good date spot. I ordered the green curry, which was good and a bit spicy, and my friend got one of the noodle dishes. Both were very good. We also ordered drinks - they were STRONG. The specialty martinis actually made my lips pucker and took me right back to my college days, so perhaps a bit too strong. The sangria was just right - they keep it up front in a decanter to let the fruit really set in, and then the liquor it up once you order it, in true Spanish style. All of that for about $40pp - I could have eaten for under $20 without the alcohol, unheard of for a NYC dinner! Will definitely be returning."
"A taste of Japan tucked underneath the city. Literally. This restaurant is actually underground and unless you know where you're going, I'm confident you would never happen across it yourself. We all decided to pop in for lunch one afternoon as we were craving Japanese food. We needed to wait for about 10 minutes for a table of 5, although couples were seated almost immediately upon entry. Their menu has a wide selection of sets, soba, and rice bowls, and they have a limited number (30) of lunch specials which we were unfortunately too late to get. For $12, you get a full set based on which day of the week it is. I opted for the maguro tororo on the regular menu because I was in the mood for some delicious cold soba. The wait for our food was definitely well over 20 minutes. If you're looking for a quick work lunch, this is NOT your place. I was actually surprised how relaxed everyone around me was, given the fact that we were in midtown and everyone was in suits. The actual noodles were not a highlight. First off, the portions are tiny. It was literally a fistful of soba, six 1-inch cubes of tuna, a helping of shaved yam, and some seaweed strips, no more. I devoured the noodles in about four bites. Some of the tuna cubes were actually already browning. And it was just an overall disappointing dish. A+ for presentation, but portions and quality were not to par. The only tasty part were the pickled cucumbers: don't know what they brined them in, but I picked through everyone else's portions after I finished mine. This place gets more than 2 stars because it has so much potential. If on time, the lunch special I believe is more than worth it. However, their regular lunch menu was very underwhelming and doesn't deserve a Â huge nod."
"I was expecting the best... but its was an ok for me.. I've never heard of this place but my friends told me it was pretty popular and that it was delicious, in my opinion I thought it was ok. I had better. I feel like this restaurant caters to Americans, and me being Asian I have higher expectations for a place that serves Asian food, not saying it was the worse but it was just ok for me. ALSO.. I hate the service here, I mean I know asian people are rude, but for a place thats so popular they need to learn some manners. Our waiter kept coming to the table to take stuff away, for example Im eating and he wants to reach across my plate to pick up the chopstick wrapper... like seriously can I finish taking my bite first.. I dont want to sound mean and make this place sound terrible but I wont be going back."
"I found this place randomly when looking up Japanese places that have a variety of food other than just sushi in HK and usually I come up with yakitori totto but I didn't want to spend too much this time around. Â This definitely fit the bill on all accounts - cheap beer (12 bucks for a pitcher of sapporo or kirin!), cheap but delicious food (10 dollars for 5 skewers, under 10 dollar ramen / pan fried udon noodles), and great atmosphere (bustling yet attentive staff). My bf and I had a great time here. Apparently it gets really busy Thursdays-Sundays but I thought it was pretty busy when I was there. By the time I left at around 8ish, all the seats were taken and there was a little bit of a wait! This place is also open 7 days a week and closes really late every day! Â So when I don't feel like chix and rix, I'm going to go here instead for sure :)"
"This review is based mainly on their chicken satay and fried calamari appetizers, which were not memorable and bad, respectively. The chicken is tender, while still maintaining nice grill marks. It comes with a generous serving of peanut sauce and pickled onions. The peanut sauce is chunky, with bits of crushed peanuts mixed in it, and it was probably the best part of the meal. At $5 for four skewers, it's a pretty sweet deal. The calamari, however, is bland and chewy. The batter is crispy, but tasteless. The calamari itself is a chore to eat - almost like you're chewing gum, except you're not, and you need to swallow. You really need to dip each piece into the sweet tangy sauce it comes with for it to taste like anything. Maybe that's why it's so cheap. A large order comes in a heaping portion enough to feed four to five people, and it's only $9.50. I wanted so badly to like Song based on good reviews from friends. Unfortunately, the food I had was mediocre at best, and that's being a little generous. Although I enjoyed the satay, it was no different from other satays I've had. There are definitely better Thai options in the city."
"I've come here only for lunch, but gotta say the special was pretty sweet. Choice of appetizer, entree and drink (which includes Thai Iced Tea). Couldn't complain about the cost - $9 got me steamed chicken dumplings, shrimp pad see ew, and Thai iced tea. No complaints on that front. So why the 3 stars? Well... the chicken dumplings came out and so did the entree...at the same time. I mean I'm all about a quick lunch, but not that quick! That and the dumplings were pretty blah. Very dry. Disappointing. Aside from that though the place is good. I'll definitely be back & perhaps the star rating will go up provided my courses have a bit more of a gap and the dumplings aren't as dry as the Sahara."
"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR PIZZA CART, BUT YELP TOOK ITS COMMON LIBERTY OF INCORRECTLY MERGING IT WITH THIS B&M SPOT IN THE EAST VILLAGE (AND NOT EVEN OVEST WHERE THE CART WAS) Dropped by on their 'opening day' to wait on a tiny line in front of their sister restaurant Ovest almost directly under the High Line for a free inaugural pie. Friendly staff, a lively community camaraderie, and a very impressive pie out of the 'world's smallest pizza cart'. It's fortunate there was no line since the oven (despite the quick cook time) is not conducive to the most efficient service. As of now their plan is to use the more general corporate Twitter to post locations twitter.com/PizzaByLuzzos"
"First, Sakagura is in the basement of the building so there is no cellphone service down there. It could be a good thing because that would sort of force to talk to whoever you are with. (but they have free wifi for 30 minutes). So, if there is someone trying to reach you or if you're trying to call someone, you would have to go the lobby upstairs to do it. Another note is that there is an elevator if you don't want to take the stairs. My friend made reservations for 9PM because she knew there was going to be a wait. We got there exactly at 9, and there was a wait. (even with reservation). There was a few walk-in as well while we were waiting. So, my advice, make a reservation! The hostesses were so nice and caring. We had a luggage and some other things, so they have a little coat check for our stuff and coats, which was very nice of them. (I tipped them when I left) So after 10 minutes, we got seated. Sakagura is known for sake, so it would be wrong to not order some sort of sake. My friend ordered a sweet sake called Umekanon Plum Sake. Not sure if that is the full name. Anyway, our waitress brought out hot towel for us before starting the meal. And served us tea and the sake. The decor for this place is very authentic and traditional of everything sake related. At the bar, they had different size cups and bottle. Sake is just as complicated as tea, if not more. So we ordered, Onsen Tamgo which had sea urchin that i never head before! Also ordered the Jaga Dango, which was a doughnut filled with mashed potatoes. As for an entree, we both got the Washu Gyu Ishiyaki which was the Washu beef cooked on top hot stone. And for dessert, we ordered the pumpkin brulee and the chocolate souffle. Â Everything was delicious and definitely had a star for each plate. The top two things I liked the most was the Washu and the chocolate souffle. Even though you would have to ""cook"" your meat, it was kinda fun. They use the fat as oil which gave it an extra flavor to it. They will also give you a new stone if it turns cold. The chocolate souffle tasted like a semi-cooked brownie. But thing that stood out the most for me was the strawberry/berry sauce that you could drizzle on top. That gave it an extra refreshing taste. It balanced out the heavy chocolate. There was also ice cream if the souffle was getting too hot, also changes up your palette from all the chocolate. Our waitress was very nice and answered any questions we had about the menu and recommendations. She also apologized when they ran out of some of the sake my friend ordered for the dessert. Just a quick aside, the bathroom is hidden within the decor that I never noticed. It's in the round cylindrical things, which I thought was interesting. I think it's in the shape of what the thing they ferment the sake? I don't know. But I thought it was nice that it just camouflages into the decor. It was such a pleasant experience. I would like to come back for lunch and see how that's like, cause they have some lunch specials. They need better cellphone service!"
"My partner and I came here to try the ramen for lunch. Â We first ordered the Zutto pork belly buns, and they were decent, albeit expensive ($10) for two. Â And then I got the seafood ramen while my partner got the tonkotsu ramen. Seafood ramen ($16) - the ingredients were fresh, poached egg was good and noodles were done right. Â However the flavor didn't come together in comparison to Ippudo or many of the ramen places in DC that I frequent. Â It tasted flat and very average. Tonkatsu ramen ($15) - underwhelming flavor and the ingredients were average. Â The chasu lost its flavor to the broth, but the broth itself didn't have much taste. Overall the food was average, even though the ramen were a bit pricey. Â The location is great, the atmosphere was good, and the staff members very friendly. Â Just wish the ramen dishes were good too. Â 0 for 2 - doubt we'll be back to try the others."
This place is the mecca for potato lovers!!! Aoli coming out of your ass. Don't go here on a date unless you really like each other because garlic and onions are the way to go!
"Dear God in Heaven, Thank you for the Raw Diver Scallops and the Salted caramel ice cream sundae. My life has been renewed."
"Been here for lunch, dinner in large groups and small. Each time is a hit. The dinning area is beautiful and great for people watching. I love to order their small plates to share. My favorites are the Brussels sprouts, Hummus with lobster and Phoenician fries. I have also had the bass as a main course and it's delicious. Portions are large for a fancy restaurant and I love that!"
"I wonder how many jewels like this one are actually there in China Town which are yet to be explored by us! We yelped for dumplings and again and again this place kept popping up along with another place which is yet to be visited. We walked for a while before we stumbled upon this hole in the wall place. It is so inconspicuous from the outside Â that you are likely to miss it if you are not observing closely. My husband and I are lucky somehow when it comes to seating in the tiniest places and we got to sit only after a few minutes of waiting. I ate the sesame pancake for the first time in my life and regretted why I didn't get a chance to eat something so delicious having crossed the 30th milestone of my life! I absolutely loved it. I would have been satisfied with only the pancake and called it a day. However, my husband being a foodie that he is, can never settle for small portions or only one dish in an eating joint. He ordered fried pork dumplings and a soup to go with it. He could never get enough of both the dishes, however I found the fried dumplings way too oily. Well he ordered steamed veggie dumplings for me without even asking me. They were fresh and flavorful. The difference b/w the dumplings at the Venessa's and Prosperity is that here the black pepper is dominant over the other flavors. I killed half of the dumplings with the siriacha sauce. My husband marveled that I, who can never stomach even a little amount of spice was able to eat so much of hot siriacha sauce! I took rest of the dumplings at home and ate them in the comfort of my home watching TV. All in all we paid only $15 for dinner for the two of us. It was incredibly cheap def! You can eat there anytime and rest assured that you shall get value for your money. This is unlike some Indian eateries in the city which are only for the namesake. If you have been reading my earlier reviews, you'll def know what I mean ;)"
"Came here for the Tuesday half price tapas happy hour. We arrived around 7:00 and were told there was a 45 minute wait.Since the happy hour ends at 8:00 the three of us decided to eat at the bar. Luckily we were able to find room - it was PACKED. The sangria was great $30 for a pretty large pitcher during the happy hour. Between the 3 of us we split the guacamole (decent), the taquitos de carne, empanadas (dry), arepa con carne (only okay), platano relleno, and the cubanitos. Standouts were the taquitos, platano relleno, and the cubanitos. Sometimes tapas can be a little on the small side but it was actually plenty of food for us, we all left stuffed. I agree with what other reviewers have said - not sure that I would come here to eat outside of the tuesday half price tapas night. It's decent tapas but overpriced for what your getting. If I paid the $16 menu price as opposed to $8 during happy hour for those empanadas I would have been annoyed. It you want to get a table during the happy hour deal on Tuesdays I would get there early. I didn't see many tables turning over between 7:00 and 8:00pm since I'm sure everyone was getting in their last few half priced tapas and drinks. Once the happy hour was over, the place definitely opened up a bit."
"I think I might like the dumplings here better than prosperity but the flip side is my beef seasame pancake dealie was simply not very good. But yea, v cheap. can't knock the hustle."
"Came here at 5pm on the Sunday.. by 6pm there was a line outside! Busy Place! We ordered 1pound shrimp, 1 pound crawfish 1 pound clams total including tip came up to $50... which I guess in the city wasnt too bad. Food wise! We got the mild spiciness with the everything sauce. It wasnt spicy at all, for those of you wanting a little heat at least go with the medium. Shrimp was nice, big firm and juicy, just the way I like it Crawfish generally was ok, there were a few small dud ones but they happen in every batch Clams werent that bad... the clam meat itself was humongous, but they slip out of the shells alot so I'm not sure if we're getting our full worth or the clam meat runs away. Sauce. Now the sauce is very important. How is it? Garlicy, good, i wish the sauce was a little... thicker i guess. It was a little bit watery Sooo those of you from LA are wondering, is it better than the boiling crab? No. no its not. Sauce doesnt permeate the seafood as much. I needed to re-dip my shrimp clam and crawfish in the sauce to fully enjoy it Service was good too. They didnt have sweet potato fries (which i like when i go to crawfish places) but overall I guess this is the only place i've been to in the city that so far that does crawfish and i'd definitely return when the cravings hit again."
"First time here, definitely will not be the last.. Gourmet pizzas, great service, great atmosphere.. Would like to see something other than pizza or salads as an alternative dish, but that's just a personal opinion.. The Brownie Sunday dessert was judged AWESOME by our whole group so make sure you try it.."
"This place was awesome. Tastier than expected. First had the cold sesame noodles. Perfect flavor and just the right amount of sauce. Not heavy. Next was the wonton schezuan style. These were also yummy, but not as spicy as I was expecting. And finally came the pork soup dumplings. :)"
"this place is ok. Â the dumplings have too much dough for my liking. Â I just prefer prosperity dumplings. Â but this place has more space for dining in, and more options but the service was slow. Â i say def try it, and let me know what u think :)"
"Cool, small spot that is tucked away on a side street in the UES. Theres only one table for 4, maybe four tables for 2 and then a bar and thats it. Come early to get a spot or you'll prob be waiting awhile. The food is delicious and the ambiance is great, however don't come if you are in a rush as they take their time to do things right (which I appreciate)."
"I came here for brunch with a group of four. Since we didn't have a reservation, we were told that we had to wait 35 - 40 minutes. We ended up with a table within 15 minutes. The waitress was accommodating and recommended some stuff for us since it was the first time for all of us to try Jane. She came back multiple times to check in on us and to refill our tap water. I got the Fried Chicken with Waffles and it was delicious. It was quite pricey ($17). With tax and tip I paid $23 overall. Definitely a nice place to treat yourself from time to time. I'll definitely be back!"
"Dayuummmm when I decided to come here after physical therapy at around 3 PM on a Thursday, I was not expecting a line. But there in front of my bleary eyes was indeed a line of about 10 people. Out the door. And it moved so slow, which is probably my only complaint because the food here is delectable, and you get major bang for your buck. My favorite in terms of Cantonese BBQ meats is roast duck, so I always get the roast duck with rice. I get the small, and it's plenty of rice and meat for me. They also serve veggies, but those are just extraneous to me. I never eat them because I like to clean my veggies myself since Chinatown veggies always seem a little grody. But the duck. Oh my this duck. It's juicy. It's tender. And it's just the perfect amount of fat under a layer of crispy skin. I love this shit. And the sauce they put over the duck and the rice. It's so rich and delicious. I'm actually salivating over my computer right now as I type this. Â  Seriously, this place is delicious, it's majorly cheap (less than $5 for my meal), and the line just shows how great this place is. Whenever I'm in the area, I always make sure to stop by. You should too."
Love the million and one sauces. There is usually a line but it goes pretty quickly. Ask for a sample to try which sauces you want!
"DEFINITELY TRY THE GREEN TEA MILLED CREPES! FOOD: This time we tried the Miso soup and one of their specials, Katsudon. The soup was okay. I didn't like it that much. Katsudon is some form of deep fried pork cutlets served with rice and shredded cabbage. The food was tasty. But the real surprise was the dessert- green tea milled crepes. I have no word to describe how delicious it was. I totally loved this very innovative sweet dish."
"The spot was not as easy to find, and we were kept waiting for almost an hour, yet everything was worth it. We ordered duck with scallion, grilled cod, spinach and soup rice. Strongly suggest the soup rice with salmon, tasty:)we would of course not forget the dessert, and simply by following others suggestion, we made a wise choice ordering the sesame brulee! Next time, we will not forget to make reservation..."
"This place has a variety of choice on their menu and is considered a good place to stop in and grab a bite if you are in the SOHO vicinity. Grilled calamari: Â it was tasty as it had the right type of marinated sauce, which helped to compliment without making it too bland, plus a nice touch to add greens onto the plate. Also this was the first to have it as a whole squid vs being chopped into small pieces. Kale salad: it was fresh with good amount of Â almond, carrot and orange added into the mix. Fusilli bolognese: the tomato meat sauce was done almost to being perfect. If the sauce was a bit less watery i think it would be a prefect entree. The egg bagel was a total miss. The bagel was spongy and it tasted like they had gotten it from the grocery store. The orange and grapefruit juices we ordered were supposedly freshly squeezed, based on the waiter's confirmation. However, I am passionate about juicing, so i can tell the difference between freshly squeezed vs concentrate. I was a bit jaded for that reason, as I specifically asked if it would be fresh squeezed prior to ordering the drinks."
"This may be a bit unfair, but I will give this place 5 star only with the pork bun. Â As a native korean, I never tasted the pork bun this tender in my life. Â It was just too good. Â Honestly speaking, their other dishes we ordered were seriously just ok (3 stars I guess). Â However, by pork bun itself they earned 5 from me. Â It was that impressive. Â  I actually tried their pork recipe from their cookbook, but I couldn't quite get the flavor. Â It's a shame I am not around the city anymore to taste that pork bun once in a while."
I went for lunch with some co-workers and ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ramen. It was delicious. The broth was so flavorful and basically just perfect. They serve it in a very large bowl and I finished it all. So good.
Best spaghetti ever! Cooked to perfection al Dante and the sauce is delicious and not too water or chunky. Nice and romantic ambiance. Sort of pricey though.
"Phenomenal food & great ambiance. A great spot for a date w/ the special someone or a celebratory dinner. What we ordered: Prosciutto e Mozzarella Fettuccine alla Bolognese Malfatti al Maialino Swordfish w/ cockles & fregula (don't remember the Italian name for this, but it's not on the website menu -- might be a seasonal thing) Torta di Cioccolato (chocolate cake & buttermilk gelato) The Prosciutto e Mozzarella was pretty good. All I ask for a simple dish like that is to not mess it up, and it passed. The pastas were superb. They were cooked perfectly and both involved suckling pig. The Fettuccine had a suckling pig ragu that was hearty & plentiful. There was enough leftover afterwords to along w/ the delicious bread. The Malfatti was great because their were sliced pieces of perfectly cooked, just-the-right-amount-of-fat pieces of suckling pig. And I love thick/wide pastas, so this dish was perfect. We were still feeling a little hungry, so we went for the swordfish. Didn't want anything too heavy, so a nice fish hit the right spot. This complemented the pasta very well, and the fish was cooked to perfection. Never had fregula before, but the little pasta morsels were a good texture. We finished off the meal w/ the Torta di Cioccolato. WOW. Might be the best chocolate cake I've had, and the combination w/ the buttermilk gelato was excellent."
"Strictly because I needed a meal that quickly and Yelp provided the most-mentioned dish just as efficiently, went with the bit-dry kimchi fried rice w/ a limp fried egg ($4.50 not $3 as mentioned elsewhere). Satisfying enough, but as much as I'd like to given the organization and selection, can't go 5 since that popular item was a 3."
"Maybe this would have been better as a tip, but here it is anyhow: Please don't get the oil/butter/happy juice from the escargot on bare skin when it's fresh out of the kitchen. It's a million degrees of deliciousness, but it feels better in your mouth.* *that's what she said?"
"Came to the boil for the first time with a bunch of friends last week. It was amazing!!! I ordered 1lb crawfish + 1lb shrimp, but I actually couldn't finish them all. The corn and potato inside are also very yummy. Plus, the mojito is super! Definitely will return!"
"Golden-Fried-Dumpling is forging ahead lately. Not resting on its laurels. Not content to lie fallow! Its got an expanded menu now with more seafood and vegetable offerings. Slight --very slight price changes, but totally acceptable. The whopping big bowl of 'Sha Cha Beef Noodle Soup' is now $5.00 instead of $4.50. I'm fine with that. Anyway it appears to me as if the place is either under new management or else, the quaint little Chinese family who runs the joint has brought in some more family members or maybe hired some new staff. Cute waifish elfin little Chinese girls now at the front counter; and they have better bi-lingual ability for English-Chinese conversations. Maybe students working part time. But GFD in general just seems to have new energy and ooomph. Hurrah!"
It's pretty good. I really like the spicy pork. I like the variety you can choose from and how you can create your own meatball dish. I think everything is reasonably priced too. It can get pretty crowded here so try to beat the crowd by coming in at 6 ish. I would definitely come back here!
"Dinner, Friday night 10pm. Not too busy. Girlfriend and I each had a glass of Malbec and shared three dishes. The wine was really warm, and it was a hot night, so no biggie there. I just prefer it colder. Big glass a plus! NOTE: when it's nice out the windows are open. It is on the corner of quite a busy intersection (Houston and Allen), which makes for some real prime people watching. FOOD: Falafel balls: my girlfriend said she doesn't want to eat again so she will never forget the taste of these. Really one of the best dishes out there - you CAN NOT go wrong with these. Grilled shrimp saganaki: really nicely grilled shrimp in one of the best sauces I've ever had. It was lemony, spicy, and the wonderful halumi made it nice and creamy. It came with two beautiful pieces of grilled bread to dunk. We also got the figs and brussels which were okay - a little sweet for me. SERVICE: Our waitress was so nice and very attentive. The manager/owner came up a couple of times and made sure we were happy and doing well. I would love to come back for brunch and/or happy hour."
"If you have traveled to Hong Kong, you'd remember the outdoor shacks of vendors that serve various noodle soups, noodles and dumplings. Here at Noodle Village you'll get the taste of just that. We started off with what reminds me of my youth. Rice noodles rolled up with Hoisin and peanut sauce topped with sesame seeds. Isn't quite exactly like how I remembered it; getting off the M15 bus after school everyday, picking this up for a dollar, but still okay. The seafood pan fried ramen was good. Not sure why they called it ramen with the exception that it was topped with fried seaweed. Sou dumplings here were as expected. A disappointment. You can't order soup dumplings at a non-Shanghainese place. The skin was chewy and it broke apart easily. What I came for was the Clay pot rice with spare ribs, Chinese sausage and mushrooms. This place makes it the best in my opinion. Always hits the spot. I've been here a million times so will I return? Always."
"I lived around the corner from this place for about a year and I really miss it. Considering there's not much else in the area in terms of late-night food spots and good bars, Greenpoint Heights is great even on its own. The burgers and fries are awesome, I probably ate too many of them. They always have good beers in bottles and on tap, and the beer prices are fair, especially since at happy hour (4-8pm every day!) they were even cheaper. I also was a sucker for the Greenpoint lemonade. I was less impressed with brunch, it seemed a little pricey, but was a perfect after work food and drink spot and it's definitely worth the trek out there from other parts of Greenpoint/WBurg."
"So what does food have to do with pull-flush toilets, milk-bottle chandeliers, and clotheslines? Sugar Freak! Astoria is a gem; chock full of a variety of cultures and cuisines. Sugar Freak is an amazingly fun place to go with a group or on a date. It is perpetually charming and quirky. Sugar Freak was my very experience with cajun, New Orlean's Styled food. Standard fishes such as beignets, poboys, and jambalya. We started off with Oysters Rock. This dish ROCKED. It is a pleasant change from the raw. These oysters come fried with creamed spinach and yummy helping of melted and gooey parmesan cheese. There were also flavorful pieces of bacon that complemented the oysters well. $20 for 8 pieces! This is a must try. The Poboys were gigantic here! These are a classic Creole food. Served on a baguette-styled bread with handfuls of deep fried shrimp, oysters, or catfish. The catfish was juicy and cooked to the perfect texture. It was still crispy on the outside but perfectly moist inside. There were a side of fries. I got the Blacked Shrimp. Perfectly seasoned with spices. The shrimp was jumbo as well! I wanted to balance out the seafood with some carbs. I went for the Pork and Beef dirty rice. Definitely delicious! For dessert we ordered french toast flavored beignets. These are very similar to zeppoles/donuts. It came with a cup of yummy drizzle. This was amazing! Just writing this review alone makes me drool a bit... perfectly fluffy, sweet, and it seriously hit the spot. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."
"HARD TO FIND prepare for a wait, even though it was short and know what you want to order our waiter didn't have time or energy to answer any questions or give suggestions thanks to you guys I ordered the pancake which was the best I have ever tried in my life, the dumplings burst w/a liquid once bitten so be careful (they were alright)"
"A number of people I know default to the chicken sandwich, but I prefer the classic pork. These sandwiches are economical, filling, and large enough to sustain me over two meals (though I've seen others finish off both halves and more in one sitting). Perfect packed lunch."
"One never forgets the moment they fall in love with something for the first time. I've read the reviews and although there seems to be plenty of better places to get Xiaolongbao in the world but this was where I lose my soup dumpling virginity. First of all, there always seems to be a wait but because the staff inside doesn't mess around, your wait will never be as long as you expect it to be. And once you're inside and order the soup dumplings, it won't be long before you're feasting on them. I didn't know what to expect. My friend tried to explain in words but he just said that I needed to try them. He kept saying Xiaolongbao in a slightly racist accent but after my experience here, I have been doing the same. The pork ones are around 5 bucks and the crab ones are closer to 7 so for the price difference, I'd stick with the pork ones (they were my favorite anyways). Each order gives you 8 dumplings so order as needed. I discovered the best way to eat these without burning your tongue or the roof of your mouth is to make a small incision at the top of the dumpling. Once that's done, slowly sucks out the oily soup broth that will change your life forever. Don't be hasty as they are very hot. Once you've sucked out about half of the soup, the other half should be cooled off and you can pop the whole thing into your mouth. If you've never tried them before, you'll fall in love instantly and be craving them the next day as you sit in your car/bus/train on the way to work. Last note: CASH ONLY. Xiao for now."
"yummy! it didn't disappoint at all and yeah it's a tiny place. and yeah the artichoke pizza was huge and didn't eat everything. but anyway, i'll try the vodka pizza next time."
"Would love to give it another try, but 3 stars is the best I can muster for now. Although, perhaps if I had ordered something else I would have given it a higher rating. Pros: the atmosphere is great. service is efficient. our waitress was good and friendly. Cons: Food was average to OK. Nothing wow. I got the veal dish. It was dry and bland. The bed of chickpeas under it was like a slightly too salty paste with a little bit of tang. Not impressed at all. The wife got the mussels. They were fine...hard to mess up mussels. But, the fries that came with it may as well have been from Wendy's. Obviously frozen crap. The only really good thing was the wine & the appetizer: Fried ricotta & smoked parm fritters. They were yum. But, we had a great time with friends so that made for a real nice evening. It's important to remember that the main reason we go out to places is to be with friends and loved ones."
"I came here for brunch and would definitely recommend trying this place out. They serve a pre fixe brunch menu for $26 which a pretty sweet deal in this part of town. The shares were more like hors d'Å“uvres and aren't particularly exciting but a nice touch in addition to our main brunch dish. At the waitress's recommendation, we ordered the duck benedict and wild mushroom pastry puff. It had a semblance of your typical brunch and not some crazy wd-50 concoction but the slight variation was exactly what we needed. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! The portions were standard but given the ingredients were heavy, we were very full. Along with the rustic interior, I'd highly recommend Feast for brunch! I can't wait to try dinner now!"
"Scott Conant does his Italian food well... Always a great pick of mine if I am ever in the area but either you have a reservation or expect to be seated at 5pm or 10pm on any given day. We did an assortment of the octopus, mozzarella in carozza and braised rib and farro to start which were all excellent. Â Fish was tender, mozzarella was light and creamy and the rib was so light and perfectly cooked. Pastas are a must - we did the spaghetti with basil and san marzano tomatoes (his call to fame) and agnolotti Â with rib and bone marrow which was excellent. Â  Capretto to finish off the meal with some spinach was phenom - I would highly recommend this to anyone. Service was great and so was the atmosphere, especially being in the meat packing district. Buon appetito"
"I like Bobby Flay and was really looking forward to dining at his newest restaurant Gato. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed in my dinner here. I tried a number of dishes however nothing was all that memorable or remarkable. To start we ordered some bar bites which included the burrata, eggplant, and lamb. Of the three, the eggplant was the best however was a bit undercooked and slimy in consistency.The burrata was nice and served chilled with a touch of balsamic vinegar but an extremely small portion. The lamb was also a tiny portion and though tender it was nothing exciting. Appetizer wise we ordered the scrambled eggs and the octopus.The octopus was cooked perfectly however the flavors were a bit mild for my taste. The scrambled eggs that were raved about in reviews were good but didn't live up to the hype. For entrÃ©es I had the kale and mushroom and artichoke paella. This dish was also highly recommended but I was not a fan. It was quite greasy, the artichokes felt a bit out of place, and the amount of rice was too sparse in comparison to the vegetables. Overall the meal was not bad per se, but nothing stood out that made me want to try anything else on the menu. The space is very pretty though and service is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Nice to sit and enjoy the scene but the food does not live up to expectations."
"Okay so i wanna start by saying that it was worth the wait!!! Wait for what?? To get a weekend reservation!! Had to stalk open table for several consecutive weekends to gt one on the labor day weekend. Finally!! Okay so ambience!! Awesome!! Zen-ish!! Or may be thai-ish!! Don't know how to exctly describe it, but either way really romantic. They also have an outdoor garden seating for a more casual atmosphere but we preferred to sit inside coz of the weather that day. Anyway, we ordered some cocktails. Cocktails were totally yummy except they had a lot of small bugs flying around and offcourse one landed in my drink. Not entirely their fault since it was raining outside that day so m assuming all the bugs came inside from the garden, but nevertheless they should have been prepared. Anyway they replaced it pretty quick and apologized a number of times. For appetizers we order beet appetizer which is one of their very popular dishes and i must say totally worth it. Then for main course i had their famous carrots wellington. I have to admit that i have never had a vegetarian wellington before. Perfect combination of the flavor and crispiness. Loved it. A lot of other tables appeared to have ordered it. We also ordered their olive oil cake which was really good too. In all worth the wait and definitely worth trying atleast one."
"It's not the best Korean food ever, but it's fast, inexpensive, tasty and conveniently located by Penn Station to grab a bite or takeout before catching a train. I like the yubuchobap (tofu pockets with rice), the kimbap, seaweed salad and kimchi pancakes. Plus, probably the cheapest booze in the city ($2-3 for a beer, less than $10 for a bottle of soju)."
"Such a unique restaurant. Almost everything I've had is good. Especially like the chilaquiles. Drinks are nice too. Good open space, great summer spot."
"A date took me here on a Thursday night.The wait wasn't too bad - we enjoyed ourselves at the bar until our table was ready. We sat in a small dingy area on the second fl by the stairs on what seemed to be a side table that barely fit the two of us. I felt really out of place sitting there. Decor isn't the greatest for someone who isn't big on eating meat, but it felt homey - Bookcases, study tables, brick wall interior. We had to wait awhile for the waitress to come, and then wait another 20 min for our drinks to come. Food was ok - artichoke dip was yummy but the mac and cheese I had wasn't anything special. Haha when a date takes you into this alleyway, go enjoy the meal?"
"Solid. Short Rib Banh Mi - As much as I prefer pork banh mi, i gave this a shot and loved it. Short rib was well seasoned and worked perfectly with the fresh veggies. Portebello Banh Mi - My veggie girlfriend had her first banh mi with this and loved it. Summer Roll - Perfect flavor, fresh shrimp but packaged in a way that the rice paper clings to the plastic wrap, so it may end up destroyed in your hand. Green Salad - This was simple, but flavorful. Fish sauce vinaigrette was great. Taro Bubble Tea - Better than your average bubble tea. This place is a perfect solution for your banh craving."
"amazing soup- forget mimosas, get the soups! cauliflower almond truffle oil, and squash pumpkin...heaven!!! sugar cured bacon = crispier version of the chinese pork jerky, yum! p.s. CASH ONLY"
"I give this spot a solid 4 stars because of the customer service. I didn't like the original drink I ordered and they weren't fussy with changing it and they ended up giving us another free drink when they realized they took too long with my friends drink order. The chicken is pretty darn good. I subbed the waffles with pancakes and they were umm a little too toasted at the bottom but still tasted good. Reminded me of my mamas pancakes. The chicken was juicy, dark meat, not too salty and left me wishing I had an extra piece. Next time I'll stick to the watermelon agua fresca and order the chicken box. My gf ordered the waffles she liked them we all thought they were a bit dense and my other gf got the chicken box. She had my meal. The grits were really good a must for me next time I go. The biscuit is not the type of biscuit I think anyone is expecting. I mean yes it's ""fluffy"" but like a really thick heavy fluff...you have to eat it to understand. Tasted great with honey. We also shared a donut....umm maybe they were voted best donut BEFORE Dough came on the scene. I mean it was good but it wasn't OMG great! I believe it's the same one that was featured on DDD. For a yeast donut I still found it kind of cakey. It wasn't as fluffy as I would have imagined kinda like the biscuit. Too full for pie. That chicken biscuit that everyone is raving about is kinda tiny for a sandwich when I looked at other tables. But hey I'm not into hot sauce so maybe for those who are it's worth it. Love that it takes cards and I'll be back! May not matter to some but I did see a lack of diversity in the staff...I'm just sayin...it's something I def noticed."
"I came here just for wine, and I loved the atmosphere. A little loud, but the wines were good (especially riesling) and plentiful, and the servers seemed knowledgeable (I'm not a oenophile, though). Looking at the reviews, it seems that I should come back for the food sometime!"
"Since it's a farm-to-table restaurant you'd expect the vegetables to be crisp and fresh, but the leaves atop our mission fig app had holes and seemed bug-bitten... Regardless, the mission fig appetizer tastes very good. The salt in ham and ricotta paired with the sweet of mission fig is a crowd-pleaser. We also ordered rotisserie chicken for two ($72 and comes with sides of beans and kale). It was a tad overly salted but cooked well. The hostess had an annoyingly arrogant air but wait staff was lovely."
the wings & vegetarian chili cheese fries was good! so was crabbie's ginger beer. was kinda skeptical tho cuz the owner didn't wear gloves and touched my fries with his bare hands. service was nice.
"I came here today around 1pm and didn't have to wait. Side dishes and homemade tofu are superb. Bi Bim Bab is delicious but overpriced and not enough to make me full. Soon Du Bu is better than other places in K-town; however, I like BCD's better."
"GREAT sauces! hands down! such interesting flavors. I had the parmesan peppercorn, Â eggplant, and wild mushroom. I think the mushroom was my favorite. The fries themselves were okay, not spectacular. It wasn't crispy enough for my taste but perhaps it was the humid weather that made them soggy. Free samples on every sauce you could probably get full just from the samples. If you're going with two people I would get the regular, it was MORE than enough we even gave extra to the table behind us. Seating only fits about 10 people but there was no line when I went around 2pm on a Wednesday. the servers are great too, very welcoming."
"Let me just say that for service alone the place gets 5 stars from me. We also sat at the bar, but the gentleman behind the bar was flawless with the service. Immediately after sitting down he asked me if I would like some water and I thought to myself: ""wow, when was the last time anyone asked?"". He was right on top of everything, and let me say that the bar was pretty busy. I had the meatballs to start, a glass of nice red wine, and then ordered the shrimp with the bacon cheese grits. Everything was solid, but nothing was too memorable or mind-blowing. All in all, I had a great experience and a solid 4 stars from Jacob's Pickles. Will def come back to try the brunch. :)"
"This American Life and Vietnamese food, what's not to like?"
"I came here for happy hour where you get a beer and 6 oysters for $12. I have to say, during the 22 years of my life, I have never tasted oysters as good as the ones I had here. They are perfectly shucked and there is no fishy taste or odor to them. I also ended up ordering a few entrÃ©es as well. I had the risotto with scallops which was delicious. The kale with squid salad was also very good, especially the dressing. And the garlic clam pasta dish was pretty good, although a little on the salty side for my taste. I would definitely come back here and oh yeah, the service here is really great. I mean really, nothing bad to say about this place."
"What a lovely joint. Simple menu made up of deliciousness. The pizza was remarkable. We had friends in from Maine and they wanted some New York pizza. Being the adventurers we are, we decided to try a new place. We were not expecting such an extravagant experience, but Brooklyn never ceases to impress. We each ordered a pie, and upon first look thought we couldn't possibly finish 4, but we easily did. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is outstanding. We will be back, and love that we found another amazing spot in our neighborhood."
"A great lunch spot but the line can be a deterrence. However, ordering right off their website makes getting delivery from there really easy."
They are my fellow Asian guys so I had to try this place. I wanted to like this place very much. I think the prices has risen but is still reasonable but I was a bit disappointed because I felt the chicken was dry and the rice was just okay. It was not as delicious as I would've hoped it would be.
"It's OK. ,I think for what it is, you will do better for a meal at the Italian place at Chelsea Market. Â I sat at the counter by the produce section and had gnocchi, which was a bit bland and scant on seasoning. Â I did however appreciate the big pro secco pour. If you go, get there just before lunch because during peak times it is packed and frankly a pain in the ass to navigate. The markets are likely the highlight with tons of cheese, pasta, meats, fish, etc. We were not able to get seated in the restaurant as it was full at noon on a Saturday."
"Trying to get reservations here for a decent hour is akin to finding the Holy Grail, but somehow my bf managed to get dinner reservations for a Sunday night. We split a bottle of red and ordered a bunch of different things. Â My biggest disappointment in coming here was that the menu online is not updated at all, so the dishes I was looking forward to such as the razor clams and scallops were unavailable. None of the dishes really stood out to me. Â It was an underwhelming experience as a whole, not to mention super overpriced for what it was worth. Â My bf loved the creamy eggs with sea urchin because he has a soft spot for uni. Â The only thing that was worth it for me was the fideos with chorizo and clams and stuffed lamb belly but even I thought it was a little too fatty for my taste. Our dessert was good. Â Chocolate creme fraiche with churro bits. Â Yum. Overall, for a Michelin-rated restaurant, I expected better."
"I had the good fortune of having a friend recommend Hearth to me, and I'm glad she did. As a first course, the warm vegetable salad, had a superb combination of perfectly grilled vegetables with a hint of pickling that I really enjoyed, a great starter, that thankfully Marco, Chef/owner recommended. I then tried the rigatoni with lamb ragu, that the barmaid had recommended, she proudly said, ""if you try anything, try that."" Â I don't think I have ever had rosemary in pasta before, but, surprisingly, it worked well with the lamb ragu. I was two for two. For a main, the lamb tenderloin, cooked perfectly with caramelized root carrots, was a home run, and everything encompassed by top notch service, in elegant dining venue, that somehow, regardless of its appearance, was comfortably casual. A good trick, that few restaurants can pull off. My only regret was not trying the meatballs, they looked really good! Maybe next time."
"I've always wanted to try Meatball Shop again in an inebriated state alongside the other drunk LES'ers, and I finally got my chance a few weeks ago! They have a line for take out only. Same menus but they were out of some things since we showed up around 2/3am. My friend was a teeeeeensy bit rowdy which prompted the waitress to bring over their bouncer (yes, a bouncer) to keep an eye on him. I ordered 3 meatballs on foccacia...and waited outside with my friends for our orders to arrive. It only took about 15 minutes (which is an eternity when you just want to get yo' munchie on), and they mixed up one of my friends' orders but nothing to complain about. The meatballs as usual were scrumptious. The bread I thought was a tad dry but I'll just write it off as cotton mouth :) yumz."
"In a city where every restaurant specializes in specialities, I welcome Houston's. The neighborhood restaurant where they specialize, at well, nothing. A menu where half of the items are comprised of burgers one would assume the burgers are ridiculously tasty but in this case they were fantastically mediocre. Nice decor, pleasant, non obtrusive service but mediocre food? McDonald's inspired burgers with $11 beers. With all the selections NYC has to offer I would pass on this one!"
"I went to the North End Grill with some family friends. We ordered the burrata and lamb skewers for appetizers. The burrata was creamy and delicious with crunchy toast. The lamb skewers weren't big enough to share (it came with 2 skewers per order) but the tzatziki sauce that came with it was delicious. You could see the specks of actual cucumber which added a nice crunch. I ordered the red snapper with leek and mussel broth. The fish was very flaky and tender. The chef even got the skin to be crispy even though it was surrounded by a very buttery and rich broth. The only critique was that there was too much broth compared to the portion of fish but the broth was delicious so maybe that's not too much of a critique? I then ordered the warm blueberry tart (they didn't have the peach dessert any longer). The tart was covered in almonds. The tart was made up more with crust than actual filling but the filling was good (when you could reach it). The gelato was also very refreshing and provided a great balance to the tart. The ambiance is great. Right as you enter, you have access to the bar and a bunch of stand up tables for drinks. The back of the restaurant is more table seating for a full sit down meal. The restaurant is right next to the water with a great view as well. Service, food, view, atmosphere were all great. What more could you ask for?"
"I've scoured the city for the best pizza and while I still have my favorites for the traditional NYC slice, Artichoke definitely wins in its very own category. Â The flavor of the pizza is so intense that even after eating lunch and multiple snacks on our way to Artichoke, we devoured this monstrous slice with no effort."
"We have been going back for the years. Whenever we think about great pizza, this place comes to our mind. The owner is wonderful and always care about his customers as he comes over to greet us. I always takes my friends and families here for pizza and wine."
"I've been here twice, and the food is delicious! Â The service is slow but friendly. Â The food is well worth the wait and the prices are perfect. Â This has turned into one of my favorite places in the city. Â The Shrimp Toast is so................DELICIOUS!"
"Good cheap eats in chinatown Manhattan. Â One of the ""dirty hole in the wall"" joints. Â  Don't let the appearance scare you off. Â You would be missing out on some great chinese food at minimal cost. The BBQ pork is excellent with great flavor. Â  The congee and fried bread/fried donut are an awesome combination for about $6 total. Â I would also recommend the typical rice plates and noodle plates too! Â Singapore rice noodle, 3 meat combo over rice, and etc. If you want to drive here, it's best to come in the morning (around 9am) and park in the meter spots. Best go-to joint for cheap chinese food."
"My review gets 4 stars because our waitress (Mimosa) was so awesome. The drinks...also really awesome. The first time was came, we got the fried green tomatoes, which were super delicious. We got the fried pickles this time and I wasn't impressed. My turkey leg was super dry. My husband loved his biscuit sandwich. The fried Oreos were awesome."
"Just terrific. outstanding food and service. Be warned if your ""old school"" they welcome children but they raise them properly in Park Slope. The wine list has some good choices that are not overpriced but you can go upmarket if you like.We went at 6 pm it was not full but busy reservations are a must."
Satisfied my hungry stomach...Beautiful Ambiance
"I love me some Shack Burger... oh, and a pitcher of Shackmeister Ale? Don't mind if I do. Like all Shake Shacks, the line can get loooooonng and this place gets packed - whether its with all the AMEX/Goldman Sachs workers on lunch or Battery Park City families after baseball game. That being said, the staff is always above and beyond friendly, the burgers delicious and the cheese fries satisfrying (see what I did there?) after a night out or a long brunch shift. Â  Unfortunately, the more I eat at Shake Shack, the more I have to hit the gym and that isn't always such an easy feat these days so I've gotta limit Shack visits to once or twice a month."
Simply amazing fried chicken so tender and juicy and melts in your mouth. The mashed potatoes oh boy we got it for our daughter but ended up eating the whole thing. That should say enough. I went simple and got the burger. Can't say that the burger was not good. Â next time I will be more adventurous and try something different and yes I did say next time because it was just that good.
"Seriously, the best pancakes in the world can be found here. The wait RIGHT when they open can be crazy...sometimes there's a line even before it opens up. Luckily, we arrived during a slow day, so we were about fifth in line 5 minutes prior to opening. This place has the best pancakes known to mankind! We ordered the blueberry pancakes with a side of the fried tomatoes and OJ....oh yeah, the OJ here is quite magical. Even if you don't like OJ...order it here, you'll love it! The pancakes are PERFECTLY crispy on the outisde and incredibly semi-soft in the inside. Seriously awesome shit, here. It's cash only - a lot of NY restaurants seem to follow that, so bring some paper with you."
"Favorite pizza place in the city. Hands down. Get either of the pies with the hot honey, you will thank yourself later. Gates of Eden salad is a must. Say hi to Paulie, he was on the Katie Couric show for God's sake!"
"I love going here for a dinner on the go. If you want a change from the usual hot food bar, go here. They have a huge variety of food and it looks pretty authentic. Aside from the buffet, they also have a lot of to-go food as well. Definitely recommend for a unique to-go meal that is fairly healthy."
"After years of wanting to try Barbuto, we finally stopped in for Sunday lunch. It is the perfect restaurant for a mild summer day as essentially the entire restaurant feels like outside seating. My wife and I decided to go all out and try the family style lunch for $50/pp. It was a ridiculous amount of food. Starters were olives, bruschetta and kale salad. The kale was a bit overdressed for my liking but I still enjoyed it. The mains were buccatini carbonara and the JW chicken. The carbonara was good but is a pretty heavy dish for lunch. I'm glad I was sharing it. The JW chicken was the star of the meal. We normally never order chicken but we are glad we got it. It was tender and juicy. My wife was gushing over that chicken. Considering that we saw tons of it coming out of the kitchen, I guess most diners know that it is the reason to visit. The dessert was an incredible warm fruit tart and they brought complimentary ice cream for our daughter. We loved the meal and hope to stop by for dinner the next time."
"nice sun-facing outside seating for lunch. great for people watching, excellent food."
A bunch of us went for Kamayan night which they have on Thursday nights at Jeepney. We were honored to be the second guests to be seated in their outdoor space. It was about 85 degrees that night so we really felt like we were transported back to the Philippines. First we got some virgin drinks at the bar while waiting for our table to be set up. Definitely get the Jeepney shake if you like corn. It had bits of cornflakes in it and it was so delicious. Next we went outside where our spread was set up very nicely. All the food was put out on banana leaves on the table and we ate everything with our hands. My favorite was the sausage and the corn bread. Both looked mediocre but tasted amazing. The food was amazing and I had a wonderful experience. The only two things that I wished were that was a fan outside or AC inside and that they served alcohol. My friend tried one of their virgin drinks which would have fabulous if it had some gin or tequila in it. Hope you guys get that liquor license soon!
"Was really pumped for this place because I've been told by several people its the best Greek in the city. However, meal was very hit or miss. Loved the feta we ordered, loved the spinach pie, loved the lemon potatoes. The veggie chips were super bleh though. Too much fried and not enough veggie. Our entree was average too. The salmon was so flavorless I couldn't even finish it. Free desert was a plus, and the meal was moderately priced. Also good service and it was easy to get a table. Â My recommendation is stick to the items that receive positive feedback here, otherwise you may be disappointed. TIP: portions are enormous, this is a good place to come with a group of friends. we had WAAAY to much food for two people to finish."
"Mecca. For real. The freshest and best lobster rolls in NYC. Whether it's at the red hook location or in the roaming food truck, both hot and cold styles transport you to New England. I could eat one every day in the summertime (and who am I kidding, probs winter too). Butttttt some of the sides should be left alone. Stick to the basics here. Travel as far as you need to to get to red hook!"
"This was a great Thai place. The scenery & atmosphere is outstanding. I got the pad sew eu with tofu & my boyfriend got the drunken noodles with chicken. My dish was reasonable, not the best I've had since I've been to many Thai places. My boyfriend really enjoyed his though! I loved the Thai tea & we also got the vegetable spring rolls which were good. The staff were alright. Not super friendly, & our waiter switched a few times which was weird. Â Besides that it was a nice place! I recommend :)"
"Good but not great, it is on the basement. Nice to TRY but I wouldn't miss anything if I did not."
"I really, really wanted to like this place, but at the end of the day I just couldn't. My friends came in early for brunch on a Saturday around 11:45am, they had just opened when we got there so we were the only ones there until it picked up around 12:30pm. Here's a breakdown of my experience Clint Eastwood style. THE GOOD: I was obsessed with the decor, I really liked the garage-y vibe and stone slab bar. The table set up was cute and there's Banksy art that covers the walls. I saw a projector above us, so I'm assuming at night they play movies or project some sort of visuals on the wall. I'd like to see how this place turns up in the evening. Also, the potato croquette appetizer was fantastic, highly recommend ordering this. My friend got the steak and eggs and loved his steak. It came with ""fries"" which were in fact thinly sliced potatoes lightly covered in spices, pretty tasty. THE BAD: Okay, so the food wasn't THAT bad, but it could have been better. I ordered the chicken and waffles (supposedly the golden ticket meal), and I thought the chicken was really dry and and lacked flavor and the waffle was tough. Maybe I just got a bad plate, it definitely had potential. The cinnamon butter and hot sauce were delicious, though. My other friend got the pork belly blt and said it was alright, a little basic, nothing to rave about. THE UGLY: The bartender was sweet, but the service all around was terrible. It seemed like the server didn't actually work at the restaurant. He kept getting flustered, he never cleared the table when we finished eating/drinking, served another table before us who had arrived AFTER us, took forever to bring us our second round of drinks (literally 10 min after we ordered them), etc. On top of all that, when we went to pay for the bill (a different server this time) she told us their credit card machine was down!! Seriously?! You tell us at the END of the meal that we have to pay cash?! We were forced to pull out cash from the ATM outside the restaurant, which typically isn't a big deal, but after everything we endured at this place the last thing we wanted was to be charged an ATM fee to pay for a crappy experience. Had they told us at the beginning of the meal it would have been a different story. Like I said, I wanted to like this place but I just don't think I'd ever go back."
"I've been here multiple times, and each time tried something a little different then the last. And I have to say though they've taken some of my favorites off the menu, this place is still worth coming too."
"I went for a late lunch close to the closing time on a Wednesday, so there was only two other occupied tables. The decor of the restaurant left a good impression - here is a place you can bring an older person for a quiet lunch, or even a casual business lunch. The teppen grill was tastefully decorated and the sake bottles lining the walls tempted me so bad - gotta come back for dinner next time. The lunch menu felt a bit limited in options, featuring probably 12 selections total of simple protein + rice + miso soup sets. I ordered the sabe (salted grilled mackerel) and my friends ordered the sweet and sour pork and hokke (grilled mackerel). The sabe was grilled to perfection. Though flavorful with their seaweed/bonito & pickled vegetable side dishes, the fish itself was nothing different from the grilled mackerel my mother used to make at home. The hokke was bigger than the sabe ($2 more expensive too) and was perfect with the crushed daikon. Order this if you prefer less salty fish. The sweet and sour pork was very Japanese...if you know what I mean. Tangy at first, but very, very sweet. Reminded me of corn syrup. The vegetables with this dish were soooooo good. Overall, I was pleasantly stuffed by the end of the meal, a surprise because I'd come with the expectation of Japanese portions. I don't know what the other review is talking about because the service here was excellent. The server was detailed in explaining the menu, everything was brought to us quickly. I felt well-taken care of, with even the manager-looking elderly Japanese lady occasionally roaming about. Bottom line: Delicious, filling, and expensive, but you get what you pay for (atmosphere & quality)."
"there's four mooncake locations, and i just learned of one! this one! oh man, i instantly loved this place. i'm putting it up there in my top 10. i got the glazed salmon, rice and salad for only 10 bucks! the fillet was nice and thick, and cooked to perfection. my husband got a pulled pork sandwich..very generous amount. and so so good. the staff is very friendly here, and it's cool, like a japanese diner setting. excellent food, reasonable prices, friendly and clean. do yourself a favor and go yesterday!"
"Absolutely without a doubt the best oysters I've ever had in my life. This place is very small so expect a wait. My friend and I arrived at about 5:30pm on a Thursday night and got the last available table before a wait started. The service was very good. They offer a happy hour of 1/2 dozen oysters and a beer for $12.You can change it to a glass of wine but that up's it a couple dollars, which I didn't like. They do not have a full bar yet but they have a pretty impressive beer selection. As for the menu I would say this is more like a tapas place. You will leave hungry unless you order many dishes. It will add up quickly. If I was in the area and looking for a pre-dinner oyster appetizer and a beer, I would probably be back."
"Sangria, potato brava's, and an amazing selection of ham...oh my! Sunday tapas was not a disappointment. Â My girls and I all enjoyed the plethora arrangement of tapas dishes we so managed to scarf down gracefully. Â After recovering from a drabby week with Strep, I was slightly perturbed at the fact that I had not been able to eat a single solid meal in a week, not to mention not being able to have a drink (alcoholic of course). Â Now while I did lose a good 10 lbs from my spontaneous sickness, I was sooo missing a decent meal. Â And boy was boqueria more than decent. Â At 34$ a pitcher, we did not let a single drop of that delicious sangria go to waste. I highly recommend the quail egg and lamb, not to mention the Potato Brava's with that sickening sauce at the bottom of the dish that I was sooooo tempted to pour all over my body because it was so yummy (ok a little too dramatic, but it was good)."
"This pizza . . . oh my god, this pizza. I dream about it! Try one of everything, but I highly recommend the one that the restaurant is named after (the artichoke with a white sauce. Seriously to die for.) I love the vibe, where you can walk away with a pie or a slice and enjoy it on your walk home or next door. It's even attached to another restaurant that sells sandwiches of which I would love to try. I live a block away, and I am still within normal weight range?! Not for long."
"OK, if you go in expecting anything except good and inexpensive food, then you are gravely mistaken. The place has zero decor, English is limited but enough to get by, and the place seems kinda dingy/seedy, kinda has a Chinatown basement kinda feel. This place is super Chinese for better or worst, it's cafeteria style, you pay at the register and you wait for them to call your number. You even have to dump the food out yourself. The food: Dumplings- I am not sure if they offer different varieties but I always just ask for steamed or fried. The steamed is always really good, the filling to dough ratio is great and the chili oil or chili sauce table side are nice editions. The fried I think it's hit or miss. Either it's perfect or the outside edges are chewy. yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦ Noodles- The noodles here are very good, the noodles are actually made in house. If you look in the back, you could usually see someone pulling noodles, it's pretty cool. I have had the beef noodle soup and the beef stew noodle soup and I really like both. I usually ask for thick noodles, I like that a little better than the reg noodles they give. Cold Items- Last time I got beef tendon in chilli oil and it was really good. The chili oil has a nice kick, I only wish the tendon was cooked a little more. Scallion Pancake with beef- I thought the dish was good but oily, I still prefer the pancakes at Vanessa's."
"I took my parents here while they were visiting and we had such a great night here. Â First things first, the BREAD BASKET. Â They had me at 'hello'. Filled with fresh foccacia, rolls, and stromboli and three different spreads (the tomato eggplant one- I want a bottle of that for my house). Â This is a must for me if I'm going five star. We started with a few appetizers: the scallops- cooked perfectly, chestnut soup- so flavorful, and the creamy polenta with a sauce of truffled mushrooms- I HIGHLY recommend this. Â If you're a fan of mushrooms, the sauce is just perfect. For entrees, I went with the black farfalle with lobster and basil bread crumbs. Â It's black because it's infused with squid ink, which I had never tried, but the waiter assured me I would love if I loved seafood (which I do). Â He was right and it was a perfect choice for me. Â I snagged some of my mom's cavatelli with capretto (which I found out is tender goat meat- and delicious) and aged goat cheese. Â My dad got the red snapper which was also great. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato on the side- it was so rich and decadent and the perfect end to a wonderful meal. Â The ambiance was nice and our waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable. Â I would absolutely come back here, and hopefully soon!"
good Philippine food I guess... I probably wont go back though for some reason
The chicken with the chicken and waffles was v. dry. The service was excellent. Â I'd give them another try when I'm in town.
"Food is a decent price, but nothing exciting. But hello location! I used to go to school uptown, but had been gone for a few years, all of a sudden there's this built up riverbank and cafe/restaurant! Ok, sure! It's super awk to get to because you have to walk down 2 blocks to get down the stairs to walk back up to the restaurant, but it's nice to go on a summer night if you want to just chill outside and admire the view of the bank (and jers). Get a bevvie, they're strong. Salads w/ chicken are a fair size for the price."
"The Red, White and Blue Special is the reason to GO, pretty much all night!!!! 6 oysters or clams and a glass of wine for 9 dollars. Â Awesome DEAL! Venue: (4/5) right off bleecker you will find this seafood cozy restaurant. Â Nothing fancy but perfect for a raw bar or seafood feast. Food: (4/5) Red, White and Blue special Â (5/5) - Fresh clams or oysters, Enough said Lobster Mac and Cheese (3/5) - Nothing to rave about, but you can't go wrong with this combo Stone Crab (3/5) overpriced for what you get Service (2/5) we had to wave down the waitress plenty of times A definite deal off a vibrant area of the city."
"We love this place but REALLY wish they could DIM THE LIGHTS a bit at dinner time--it would add a lot to the ambiance. I don't recommend for a date for this reason unless you don't care about that sort of thing. Also sat at the bar last time and all their yummy vegetable sides are sort of on display--but with saran wrap covering. I'd recommend they invest in a nicer way of presenting. Great food, but could use just a touch more attention to detail to really take it up a notch. Sparkling sake would be a nice addition too."
"One of the best meals I've had in New York City... And I've had a lot! Â Everything from the time you walk in through the dinner service was spot on. As a vegetarian I was very happy with the options available on the menu. Â I started off with a Manhattan, and a farm fresh vegetable salad with ricotta cheese. Both were excellent. For my main course I had the Gnocchetti summer vegetables & truffle sauce. The pasta was perfectly cooked and had just enough salt in the sauce. For dessert I had a lemon semifreddo Â with pistachios... Again perfectly balanced bites. Probably the best part of the meal was the service, our server was extremely helpful, attentive, and had our food timed out perfectly. Since this is so close to where I stay in Chelsea I am positive I will be back soon."
"Really tasty. The food quite delightful, although a little oily. Definitely will pay it a visit again."
"ahhhh oysters!!!! Â These were the best oysters I have had in over a year. Â Fresh, clean, and lovely. Â Apparently their oysters are from the same supplier Per Se uses for their oysters. Â mmmm. They have an excellent bourbon and drink list, fabulous wine selection too! Â The beet salad was delectable, could have been my main course. Â The goat cheese was so creamy and accompanying horseradish vinaigrette made me want to lick my plate. Â I had the special of skate and the cassoulet looked amazing. Â Finishing things off the most decadent banana split and a cup of coffee. wow. This place is hidden on a residential street in Williamsburg, but worth seeking out! Great for dinner and drinks. Â Charming staff. PS: Â I love that they use a random assortment of vintage dishes and real silver utensils."
eh. nice place and decor. very brunch-esque atmosphere. drinks were large and good. food was eh. pizza was too bready and nothing special. mushroom truffle app was just ok with not enough mushroom. prob wont return.
"Authentic chinese food. Inexpensive price. huge portions. very casual. I ate here for dinner and ordered the pan fried noodles with vegetables and beef. the meal wasnt great, because i should have ordered the broad noodles, so i didnt get what i wanted. very extensive menu, i will definitely go back again."
"Riverpark is very difficult to rate. The room is nice and if you get a table that views the East River, it is even nicer. Diner's outside enjoy the view but also have to share the view with FDR Drive traffic. As for the food.. Salmon Tarter with capers lemon and parsley would have been good if it wasn't so damn salty and would have been a lot better if it was served with toasted french bread instead of the ridiculously salty potato chips they served it with. Duck Confit Ravioli with summer melon, fennel, and duck Prosciutto (whatever the heck that is) was good but the temperature varied too much within the ingredients themselves. Â Entree of Diver Scallops with corn, tarragon, chanterelle mushrooms tomatoes and bacon consisted of 3 scallops and some excellent corn. For $33.00, it was a rip off. Â It was good, but NOT $33 good! On the other hand, the branzino with tomato consumme, freekeh, celery, ginger and mustard frills was good and an acceptable portion size, but it tasted like branzino in a smoky tomato broth. Dessert was the Peaches and Cream sundae with creame fresh ice cream, sponge cake, and almond brittle. It was more like a mashed up peach sponge cake served in a glass. Not bad though. Service wasn't the best. I had to beg for more bread (twice) and the waitress asked me if I wanted more coffee (but not my dining partner) then filled my cup THEN said ""it was decaf, right?"". Yes it was, but if you needed to ask that question , you should have asked it BEFORE you poured the coffee. My dining partner wasn't offered more coffee, but was presented with the check. The restaurant is located on the East River just above the FDR drive, next to NYU medical center. It's a pleasant place, but for the price, and the long walk to get to it, I'm not sure I'd go back."
"Top 5 breakfasts I've had in my life. The wait can be long, so plan to come early. I got a recommendation to try the blueberry pancakes with a side of the sugar cured bacon. It was very sweet, but man. That was a great breakfast to say the least. They use real blueberries to top off the already perfectly griddled pancakes. The sugar cured bacon was hands down the best bacon I've ever had. The outside is crispy and sweet, and it almost tastes like there's a very tiny invisible layer of bacon flavored candy on the outside layer. And the salty taste of the delicious bacon itself offsets it perfectly. My friends had the eggs benedict(delicious) and some salmon dish which I didn't get to try. One other thing: their strawberry jam (more like preserves, because you can tell it was made from real strawberries) was to die for. I seriously wish I could have that on my toast every single day. Definitely a terrific place to have breakfast when you're in the city. Prepare to pay up though, the place ain't cheap by any means!!"
"This was on my list for places to try before I move, so tonight was the night. Ordered the Steamed Vegetable Dumplings and the Wok Basil With Chicken. The dumplings were fantastic. I'd just make a meal out of those. The Wok Basil had a good spicy, and actually paired really well with the dumplings. The wok could have used some other veggies or an additional flavor profile, but solid choice nonetheless. Glad I finally hit this place up, and hope to squeeze in a second round soon."
Whenever I come to new york I always stop by this place several times. They have the best dumplings and they are so so so cheap. I'm pretty sure they are losing money selling me these delicious treats. They have many different kinds of dumplings but I just go for the classics. The people here are quite nice and have been helpful when I did not know which dumpling to get.
"I love myself a thin crust pizza but the pizza at Rubirosa really didn't do it for me, tried the tye dye and vodka, while it was tasty it's nothing I'd rave about or go out of my way to have again. I did enjoy the cozy dim ambience and the wine the waitress recommended was delicious."
"I came here with high expectations. Â I think I would describe the decor as upscale industrial. Â It is very clean but with interesting accents like the aged mirror. Â My family and I tried peekytoe crab toast, bowtie pasta, mackerel sashimi, pork belly over radish salad, and a white fish entree. Â The pork belly was crispy and nice but nothing was very memorable. Â A friend told me the peekytoe toast is phenomenal but I found it a bit fishy. Â  The highlight of the evening was the sundae. Â It tasted like a deconstructed snickers bar -- salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts, chocolate sauce and popcorn."
"The food was all extremely flavorful. We had the burger with egg, which was amazing, although a bit small, and was cooked well done when asked for medium. Â Had a chicken special with garlic rice (yum), bok choy and this plantain-like banana side which was jaw dropping. Â I've never had anything like it. The drinks were very expensive. This pineapple sharable drink which didn't seem to have much liquid in it was $25!!!!! Still, I will be returning. The service was good, waiter was knowledgable and the table next to us had Kamayan Feast that had us jealous. Highly recommended!"
For vegetarian food this place is not bad. Â Go for meatless Mondays!
"Really inexpensive-fast-quick korean food (anyone who eats korean, knows it's expensive) It's not Michelin starred but really worth more than they charge. Where else can you get spicy pork, rice, miso soup for $5.50? NO WHERE nuff said"
"The first time I took advantage of the amazing happy hour! one of the best sangrias (both red and white are good) and tasty sweet cocktails (I think I had one with lychee and agave syrup?). calamari is done to perfection but it's the honey sauce that puts the cherry on top. Love the vibe and music, love that it's not pretentious (given that the second time I came here was after eating at Beauty & Essex). Everyone is just having a great time and it just rubs off on you. Will definitely look forward to going back soon."
"Stop and tell me if you've heard this before... when is Yelp gonna incorporate a .5 star system?? Ha, I know the subject has been beaten like a dead horse, but I would like to use it now to rate Lucali's 3.5! Â Oh well, guess I'll be generous and bump them up to 4Stars. The restaurant is in an awesome neighborhood in Carroll Gardens. The space is smaller than I imagined with roughly 30 seats. My girlfriend and I had to wait about an hour and a half to be seated on a Friday night. We put down our number and found a bar close by. When we were finally called we still had to wait outside for them to finish cleaning our table. The owner was playing host and I struck up conversation. He was an extremely friendly Italian guy. Told me a little about he business and how he was looking to extend the restaurant with the store front next door for more seats and a bar. He recommend trying the calzone. When we finally sat down we realized there was no menu. Pizza and calzone were the only things to order. We got both. The calzone came out first and it was very good. It wasn't life changing, but I very much enjoyed it. I love the accompanying marinara sauce on Â the side. The pizza was extraordinarily good, as well. Very soft crust and fresh ingredients. I knew Lucali's was considered one of the Best Pizza in the city and it met expectations. The reason for the 3.5 star consideration was I felt the restaurant was missing something. I couldn't put my finger on it. I don't know if it was the limited menu, the tiny size of the restaurant, the hour an a half wait, or maybe that they don't open earlier than 6pm but Lucali wasn't a ""HAVE TO COME BACK ASAP"" experience. It was good and I would probably like to come back, but it won't be first thing on agenda. To me Roberta's in Bushwick was on a whole different level. In all, good experience, friendly staff and owner, very reasonable price, and BYOW. which are all amazing but there was just something missing."
"In a lot of ways, this place has all the usual Brooklyn brunch headaches: I waited 35 minutes for a table for 2, I sat near the door and it was cold, they were cash only and I only had credit... But that being said, the service was great, and both mine and my friends' meals were AWESOME. I had the french toast and it was delicious. Bottomless coffee, excellent service, and a cute space were all perks. Would definitely recommend coming here!"
"I tried the famous artichoke pizza, and it was very salty. I was parched after eating a slice. The slices of pizza here are very thick crust, probably due to the fact that the toppings are super heavy. The artichoke pizza is prety much spinach artichoke dip sitting on top of a thick slice of pizza. I hope to try out the margherita and the penne ala vodka."
"VODKA SAUCE PIZZA! I've never had a vodka sauce pizza till I went to New York and unfortunately can not find a place near my home that sells it. Darn. But anyway, Prince Street Pizza is just a few blocks over from Broadway so after some SoHo shopping, my boyfriend and I love to come here for a quick bite. The workers are really cool and nice. Pizza is delicious. This is where we first tried a vodka sauce pizza and I absolutely love it. Price isn't so bad either. Definitely our go-to place for a slice of pizza!"
"I eat here at lunch. Â When I get there around 11 or 11:30, I have never had to wait for a table. The pizza is delicious, I love the dough and consistency. Â The toppings and specialty flavors are fantastic. Â Even if you don't usually eat the crust, there's a good chance that you will here when you dip it in the pepper oil they have out on the table. I'm partial to the Margherita and the Speckenwolf, but the other choices are great as well."
"I saw that this place has 4 and 1/2 stars on Yelp, and the menu looks decent, so I decided to give a try. Â The service was very pleasant and Â the surroundings were nice but, unfortunately, most of the food we tried sucked. Â Only the dessert was good. Â (The dessert was actually excellent.) Here's what we had: risotto with ""langoustines"": Â this was a special; the rice was too dry for risotto (and had an oddly bitter taste), and the so-called langoustines were actually large prawns, not langoustines, and they had an unappetizing, mushy consistency; very disappointing, especially for $24 glazed duck breast: Â that was also a special; the duck was dry and tasteless; another disappointing dish fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini: Â not horrible but not particularly good, either; call it average or, perhaps, slightly above average tuna tartar: Â this had no flavor; something should have been added to this to give it some kick (wasabi?); even salt would have helped vanilla pannacotta for dessert: Â after all of the bland, mediocre food we had eaten for dinner, we were surprised to find that the dessert was outstanding. Â Not just good compared to the other food at this restaurant, but really good by any standard."
"I came here with a friend on a Wednesday night. We had the calamari and shrimp appetizer to start. As part of the seafood mix, they also included a few slices of fried lemon which was interesting to nibble on. The accompanying aioli wasn't special but it was tasty. Next we had the speck and mushroom pizza. The pizzas here are definitely made for sharing. I felt pretty full afterwards. Good classic combination with the rosemary and cream sauce but i really didn't taste the truffle oil except in 2 bites. The crust was crispy without being burnt like at Company and the prices are good. Most importantly there is a good ""chew"" to the bread. Service was friendly and fast. They do get very busy so expect to wave someone down for a new bottle of water. Lastly we had a celebrity spotting so that was awesome! Cool atmosphere and good food. Plus we ate at 7:20 and there wasn't a wait which was amazing!"
"I was craving South America food after coming back from a trip there. Really delicious rotisserie chicken. I've had the bistro a la pobre, rotisserie chicken, ceviche mixed, and the fried plantains. The ceviche was good but I've definitely had better ceviche in South America so I guess I have higher standards. The rotisserie chicken is tender and nicely seasoned and the ceviche was good but not he best I've had. The plantains were not as soft and sweet as I usually like but I guess I can deal with that. Overall a great meal for the price."
"My absolutely favorite Seamless Web location! Miso-Glazed Salmon and 20-minute delivery times. Awesome chicken wings. Dumpling Soup is filling on its own if you want something light, warm and delicious! Next stop, seamlessweb..."
"Really want to give it 4.5 starts. Right up there with Lam Zhou. Pricing is equivalent. Place gets damn packed. Noodle soups are great, as well as the dumplings. Man i want it right now. This place is better than Tasty hand puled noodles."
"Hands down an undeniably cute place.....very tastefully decorated and a nice ambiance, but the food is not great. I'm baffled by all the press they've gotten. Somebody is friends with someone somewhere. I agree with several other posters who stated that its not really West Indian food. Very bland, and generally missing the spices and deep rich flavor that come from the mom Â and pop places in crown heights. Watered down to cater to non-west Indian people. Overpriced too."
"Update is....... Pinto is still crushing it. Â Sunset menu (before 6PM) is an insane deal for an appetizer, main, and drink (nonalcoholic or wine/beer) for 15 bills. Â Insanity. Â Portions are regular sized too! Â The crispy rolls (appetizer) were filled with mushrooms and yummy, and my basil shrimp main dish was really hearty with a solid kick of spice to it. Â Five stars for the sunset menu, and I have to say I arrived at 5:58 PM and they didn't bust my chops about ordering off of the sunset menu. Five stars also for the service. Â I have been here a few times and each time I am completely impressed with the friendliness and hospitality of all the servers at Pinto. Â I have had a little better Thai food at other restaurants, but the food here is really good and the value and service definitely warrant five stars."
"This place is awesome, the food, the staff BYOB friendly other than that everything else is great. --Service is awesome --Everything is ORGANIC --From what I've heard you can walk in here and just buy meats :) --You can actually buy their dry rubs to marinate your meats just like them! --Everyone is friendly! --I had an awesome time, so far so good can't wait to go and again so I can improve my review. :)"
"This is a good place to get pizza if you're wanting a heavier pizza. If you can handle heavy food or have people to share with, I suggest trying their signature pizza, Artichoke & Spinach. It's rich and reminds me of a tasty chicken pot pie. Now if you're wanting a lighter option, the Margarita is very good. The sauce is bright and flavorful. You will finish that slice by yourself. The crab pizza grossed me out. I honestly couldn't finish it. It was basically a cream cheese crab dip baked onto a pizza. It was too rich and gooey (in a bad way). There are more seating available now that Zeppoli's closed down. I still take my slice to go and eat it on the way to dinner. :x"
"Went for lunch and 3 sliders was a good fit for my belly. I went crazy and tried all 3 meats (beef, chicken, and pork) and 3 sauces (tomato, spicy meat, and mushroom). All were great but I'd rank pork and mushroom as my favorite combo. Since I didn't work out and did nothing to deserve it, I ordered a chocolate chip and mint ice cream sandwich. Oh mama."
"Not always a fan of huge, really expensive lobster rolls, but I really did enjoy all the food at Lobster Joint. $4 sliders during happy hour are a pretty good deal and you get about a claw full of meat. Oysters are pretty fresh and tasty too, especially for $1 each. Weirdly enough, I've never had drinks here during happy hour, only food. And you know what? I don't regret it one bit. Mahi Mahi Sandwich is a bit salty, but the salmon sandwich is always pretty killer and the prices for each are pretty decent. $12-14 for a seafood sandwich and a big portion of fries? Not too shabby at all. Lobster bisque is pretty good and there are some big chunks of lobster, but I kinda wish they used cream. Seems a bit acidic for my taste, but still decent. Onto the lobster roll. Quality stuff. They definitely load up the lobster and the flavors are pretty well balanced. And again, since it comes with fries, I guess I can forgive the $17 price tag. I can't say I'll always get the lobster roll, especially with all the other good offerings, but definitely one of the more solid lobster rolls in all of New York City. With a name like Lobster Joint, well, you know it better be good. Given that it's in Greenpoint, the crowds aren't as bad, and I feel like the prices are pretty good for a high quality seafood joint. This is definitely a place to check out, no matter which location you hit up. I've actually never been to the LES location even though it's closer to me, but I can say the outlook is good, given the quality and value I got at the Greenpoint location. After comparing menus online, seems like the prices are pretty even, which is another good sign."
"It's fitting that Bo Ky is my hundredth review. In a weird way it's places like Bo Ky that got De Blasio elected. Yes, the place is pretty dirty. The service isn't the best. And of course there is that faint smell of urine that takes about 7 minutes to get used too. But isn't that what makes places like Bo Ky amazing. This is not the place your going to take your parents when they are in town (unless they are like to spend under $25 for an authentic meal for 4). Bottom line is, the noodles are amazing and most dishes are $5.50. The curry with rice or soup is to die for. Mushroom and duck soup is another one of my favorites. Great lunch spot if you work downtown. It's possible to go there from Fidi and get back to work in a reasonable amount of time because the food usually comes out in about 23 seconds after you order."
amazing
I came here for my birthday dinner about a year ago. Both the food and service were great. They gave us a complimentary appetizer and sang for us. Love their pastas. Make sure to make a reservation since this place gets packed quickly.
Awesome fresh cut fries! Love their dipping sauces. The garlic mayo and cheddar cheese was delish! Great food to end a night of bar hopping!! Will definitely go back and try more of their sauces.
"A trendy yet casual atmosphere with fancy but understandable food - perfection. Great service. They start the table with bacon popped pop corn - delightful and fresh. Perfect way to start a meal. Got the Korean BBQ wraps and scallops to start. Korean wraps were messy to eat but delicious and juicy. Great flavor. The scallops were a little sandy but the accompanying carrot pure and capers paired perfectly. I always ask server what to order... And he said the duck. The duck was fantastic (I don't even like duck). The skin was crispy and the meat was moist. The butter lychee were excellent and added a great layer of flavor that made sense. Sweet and savory. Husband got the hanger steak. Good portion with good amount of beets. Simple but tasty. The dessert was just bad. The lychee panna cotta with yuzu sorbet was fresh, but just tasted weird. We also got some kind of marshmallow item with chocolate biscotti and even that was bad. The biscotti was flavorless and overly dry and the marshmallow tasted like cheap sugar. We ate some of each and then went to cold stone. Upon entering the restaurant, an unfortunate event occurred, but the staff was gracious and kind and even though we didn't make a big deal about it, when they brought the check, the drinks were comped and they gave us a dessert on the house. Price was fair, but a bit too pricey to come back without being head over heels for it."
"Surprised they use open table. Earned dining points woohoo. Food was okay. Got the duck confit and burger. Price was reasonable. If you checkin yelp, you get a free side order. We got brussel spouts. Pretty good..came with bacon and bit of honey. Cocktails? Horrible. Get wine instead. I ordered a peach margarita. Came in a small cup, no straw. It was sooooo sour and I think they just gave me a regular margarita. No peach flavor at all. Sorry, you guys need a better bartender."
"Fried Dumplings are good, Fried Pork Buns are good...i wouldnt go there for the Wonton Noodle Soup (there's more HK-style ones elsewhere) but overall a great place for a cheap dinner! Good luck getting a seat, this place gets BUSY! But people are usually in and out quickly! The sesame pancake I didnt rate so highly either - was a bit too ""carb-y""."
"This is my go to place for noodles anytime i am in the mood for them. Tasty hand-pulled noodles destroys what you may have been accustomed to simply going around the corner to your local Chinese restaurant and ordering some lo-mien. It is the most fresh, tasty, well seasoned vegetables,noodles and meat i have ever sat down to eat in NYC. Ive had their noodle soup as well as the pan fried noodles and have not been disappointed with either one. As far as ambiance, most hole in the wall establishments are not there to cater to your eyes, but are there to give you a wow factor of food you normally don't get in your own neighborhood. The service is pretty good, as the staff is extremely friendly (i was offered a cup of tea when i was only getting take out) and will get you anything you need if you ask for it. Another hidden delicious gem here is their dumplings, steamed or pan fried, they hit the spot and are even more yummy with the full flavored sauce they give to accompany it. Don't think about it, just go...now"
"I had a rather uneven experience here, but I definitely liked it enough to return! A group of friends stopped by for happy hour right when the bar opened at 4pm. The doors were wide open, but the staff was still in their meeting. After about ten minutes, they told us to sit down and they would help us when they were through. I found it a bit odd that a restaurant would serve customers so much later than they officially open, but maybe they don't generally have people show up on time. Our first waitress didn't seem interested to help us. Like, at all. So we were thrilled when a different waiter came over and patiently explained all the $7 wines on the happy hour menu. (The regular wine list is in a tabbed binder and seems intimidating.) He even explained the type of soil that the grapes grow in without sounding condescending or bored. We all ended up trying different types (and liked them all). We also tried the FREE sherry, which wasn't as big a hit since it has a particularly potent taste. We ordered all the discounted bar snacks. When we were there, olives, mozzarella balls, and duck fat bruschetta were on special. They were all delicious, but beware, vegetarians--the mozz is in meat sauce, which is not labeled on the menu. There isn't a lot of other food on the menu, so we went elsewhere for dinner. All in all, I loved the decor and the neighborhood, and I especially loved getting a fancy wine experience with a happy hour discount, but there were a few bumps in the road."
"Great low-lit date spot in Williamsburg, and even worth the trek for those who don't live there. The highlight was the bar menu (nice wine and craft beer selection) and the oysters. Fresh oysters. Oysters from the L.I. and New England. Divine oysters. Did I mention the oysters?! Save room for the chocolate and sea salt tart at the end."
Divey pub with seating area in the back for diners. Â The burger(s) did not disappoint!
"Not my favorite brunch thus far in NYC but it was an a-ok one in my brunchbrigade. Started with the oatmeal brulee. Now if this was offered as a brunch dessert option, then color me impressed. But, it was not. The oatmeal (wild hive 10 grain porridge) was rich, nutty, and seedy. I have never had oatmeal like that before and I would love to have it again. But without the heavy bruleed top. Too much brulee. If the sugar layer was thinner then maybe this would have worked but it was too thick for Â breakfast starter. Baked Brioche French Toast with poached pears and butterscotch sabayon, hello luxurious. What I loved about this french toast that the bread was still bready. The pears, perfectly poached. My Cookshop scramble atop a buttermilk biscuit was good but not $16 good. I would have rather had the fried chicken biscuit sandwich from Cheeky's for $10 less. I do have to give them a nod for even on a packed Sunday, they did hold my reservation as we arrived about 10 minutes late. Kudos there. Service was just fine and as soon as my coffee sugar packet hit the table my server swiftly picked it up. I appreciated that little detail. Â I also witnessed the napkin fold being done at a table over yonder. You know how that makes me swoon. Service definitely over shines the food here which is great but I've got lists of brunch spots to try so I doubt I'll make my way back here."
Amazing cocktails and great food. Â I love this place!
"This place is TINY, its REAL TINY, but hey, size doesn't matter if you already have a table... so make reservations. Â They have BYO and I don't remember there being a cork fee. Â I've been a few times and I've always had great meals. Â The prices are reasonable and the food is great. Â Take your out of town friends here to show them how small and good restaurants in the city can be."
"I came here for dinner on a weekday night and was glad I made reservations. Â It was a packed house on a very cold day. Â I made reservations the day of for a party of four. Â We were seated immediately and there was a mixed scene. Â Our drink cocktails were okay, nothing crazy or special. Â Priced about 8-10 dollars. Â The dinner/food quality was the real star here. Â We ordered a bunch of appetizers. Â The gnocchi that people rave about on the other reviews was received very well by our table. Â It was a generous portion of gnocchi with ricotta. Â I'm usually hesitant to order calamari when i'm out, but in this case it was also excellent . The sauce was tangy with a hint of heat. Â The breading was very light and the calamari was not too heavy. Â The flat bread had a delicious caramelized onion with goat cheese. Â The rest of the table was lukewarm on the wild mushroom with sunny side up egg and grits, but I liked it alot! Â I guess I'm just a weirdo. Â I ordered the braised beef short rib which was good. Â It had delicious vegetables but I wish the beef short rib was a bit fattier/softer. Â I guess it comes down to preference. Â Meat entrees were in the 20-30 dollar range and the pasta entrees under 20 for the most part. Â I would come here back again. Â I'm eager to try their brunch."
"Dinner July 2014. Nice, open atmosphere although a little loud for conversations. Foie gras and chicken liver was surprisingly good, as was the warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Good cocktails."
Joju has never disappointed me!
"The duck was delicious and the salmon too. Overall the taste is very mild. It is not ""impactful"" but it is very good to eat. Service was good. Slightly overpriced."
"I try to stay away from these ""NYC Go-To"" spots that everyone rants and raves about. Buttttt, after living in NYC for 7 yrs...I guess it was time to try Cafeteria and see what all the hype is about. The wait wasn't long at all, we were immediately seated as soon as our complete party showed up. I didn't have the mac & cheese, so I can't make any commentary on that. I had the steak sandwich and calamari. I LOVE calamari and I was not impressed. Â Way too much breading..I could barely taste the calamari. The steak was tough, but was flavorful, the fries were yummy. I was HIGHLY disappointed in my drink. I had the wildberry mojito and it was soooo weak. I'm a lightweight and I barely even tasted any alcohol in my drink. The waiters are adorable. Service was great! Just wasn't crazy about food or beverage. I suppose it's convenient for late night munching."
"**CASH ONLY** This cute cafe is a must try when you're in the Bushwick area. Everyone around this neighborhood are laid-back and that transcend the atmosphere of this cafe. Do get: Mimosa- Whether it's freshly squeezed or out of a Tropicana the mimosa was so delightful. I ordered seconds b/c it was that good. Fried Catfish Po'Boy- Â Fried fish with savory cabbage topped with mayo and pickles served in a baguette. It was beyond delicious, I'm craving for it now."
"Great place to spend a birthday! The waiter suggested a really great wine that didn't break the bank. Â There was way too much to tempt and tantalize here. Â The pizza was respectable for a non-Italian place, and we could have easily had a few more.The steak was other-worldly! What do they do to it to get a non-red-meat-eater like me to be stealing bits of it off someone else's plate when they're not looking? (I stuck to my own table, but did look around a bit.) Â And desserts just should have been an ""all-or-nothing"" deal...Too hard to choose one or two. Chocolate peanut butter cake....oo-la-la! Service got a bit frazzled at the end. The hostess needs to give 20 minute advance notice when she needs the table you happen to be sitting at."
"What a great find. Totally stumbled into this one. All their rum drinks are fabulous. I never had Arepas before, I ordered the leak vegetable one. It was sooo delicious, savory and juicy. Amazing. Decor inside is made out of tin and plywood, it does feel like in Venezuela! Fantastic place."
"For appetizers my friend, cousin, and I ordered their cherry pie. Â Cherry pie for appetizer?!? Damn Straight! Â The crust was crispy and chewy. The filling was right on point. As for chicken and cheese grits. SOLID. Â I'm glad I ordered my own chicken and didn't share with anybody."
"This place is a great oasis in the middle of bedstuy. It might be hard to get to, or not, but regardless it is worth the trip. Hands down the best chicken and waffles ever, and their duck was cooked to perfection. Their menu definitely have some interesting combinations but I haven't been disappointed with one thing I ordered. I don't know why anyone else hasn't thought of turning nachos into dumplings before but the world should never be the same. I got them as an appetizer and then when it came time for desert I ordered them again :$"
"I've passed this little place several times and never noticed it until a couple of weeks ago! There were kids running around from a large birthday party which was a tad annoying, but otherwise the atmosphere was nice. The wine was delicious but don't come here hungry. The portion sizes are TINY - i suppose they're going for the tapas style. Though small, the food has a big bite - I particularly loved the ricotta/tomato crostini."
"What a great selection of tapas! I wanted to eat everything on the menu. I could live off of their bacon wrapped dates and their fried goat cheese. Their red sangria is yummy and packs a good punch! Ambiance is great. Perfect for a date, dinner with mom and dad, or a girls night out."
"3.5 stars... This recently opened Mexican spot is the brainchild of the previous chefs from a former Williamsburg Mexican hotspot that had closed down. The space is beautiful and well thought out and everyone I encountered working there were amazingly and genuinely happy and friendly. I wish I could give them a slightly higher rating given all their positives but they do have a few downfalls. For starters it's cash only, the don't have alcohol (BYOB), and they didn't have free chips to munch on while waiting for the meal. I did see chips coming out of the kitchen which leaves possibility for three scenarios. Either you have to pay for chips and salsa (something that is complementary at nearly every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to), you have to ask for free chips (in which case they should have asked if we wanted some in the first place), or they just forgot to give them to us (an unlikely case seeing how there were few people here and we were sitting right by the bar). But I digress. The menu here is small, simple, and straight forward. The prices are quite reasonable ($8-15). I ordered the pork burrito, my date ordered the steak burrito. I found the pork to be tender and flavorful but the overwhelming amount of cheese in the burrito mostly hid this flavor and most if it's texture as well. I found the ratios to be much more pleasing in the steak burrito (which they had mistakenly identified as the pork burrito when bringing it to our table). I do like this place and will eventually come back but this time I've got to stick to the 3.5 stars."
"okay, so the food itself might merit 5 stars, honestly. the mashed potatoes -- balancing a nice creamy texture with a hearty chunkiness, & bursting with all sorts of garlic & basil accented flavors -- may be the best i've ever had, save for my mother's legendary homemade taters. the chicken meatball smashers with spicy meat sauce & provolone, overflowing off its roll in the best way possible, was a revelation. i made the mistake of overlooking the specials list & not ordering the moroccan chicken meatballs, but my friend / dining partner was nice enough to let me try hers -- & it did not disappoint. i would return to the meatball shop for their delicious creations every day if i could. the only reason i've dropped this down to 4 stars from a plausible 5 was the off-putting service from our ""hostess."" after a 45 minute wait (which was fine, i understand you have to wait for tables in new york, it comes with the territory), we received a text that our table was ready, & gleefully finished our drinks at a nearby bar & sprinted over. however, upon arrival, we were forced to wait an additional 40 minutes, & deal with the holier-than-thou attitude of the hostess, who would -- i shit you not -- not even look up at us when telling us, basically, to just deal with it. no apologies, no sympathy -- just total bitchiness. the server inside was accommodating enough to expedite our orders when i casually mentioned i didn't have much time, but the snobbery i received at the door was enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth for the dining experience that no amount of meatballs could displace. maybe i'll try another location or go on a different night."
"Lori beat me as first to review! Argh. Will have to send her a little note on her great review after this. :) The long awaited Hudson Eats is beautiful. Â The views of the marina and harbor are amazing. Â The food court is bright, shiny, new and gorgeous. There is a lot of open seating and it looks like people are treating the larger tables as communal tables, which is good. The wealth of choices is impressive. Â Burgers, salads, vietanamese sandwiches, tacos, barbecue, and more! Â (I wonder how well Sprinkles will do however - how often will people buy cupcakes?) Thank goodness we (those of us who work in the WFC - sorry, still can't call it Brookfield Place) are so thankful we have other otpions besides Devon and Blakely and the Amex caf. Â  Woooo!!! Yay Hudson Eats!"
"For a yelp foodie, I haven't really had an appetite lately. Finally, on this day, I was starving! My boss got a classic and a couple of other coworkers got some things. I, myself, had a really freakin good Fried Chicken sandwich from here: Fried Chicken, Pepper Jack, Red Cabbage Slaw & Melt Sauce on Sourdough We all got our food except the person who ordered the Big Skinny: Mozzarella, Grilled Mushrooms, Roasted Tomatoes, Red Peppers, Arugula & Sherry Vinaigrette on Sourdough Toast. We were like, ""Good job ordering those veggies..."" No, not really, we were nice, but I got mine way before her. I don't know what was taking so long. Thank God it was a decently warm day, since you're standing outside by the pick-up window. My boss was thinking that his sandwich was going to be all soggy by the time he ate it. It probably was, but it is a melt anyway. We all got tater tots too. My friend and I coulda shared them. My sandwich was pretty big so I was able to take home half with some spare tots. I ate it all for dinner, pre-Santacon. I think it helped me survive the next day. I drank for 17 hours...."
"Just an all around fantastic place to go. Â I have never had a bad meal here. From late night drunk snacks, to full on dinners to private dinner cooked by the owner Beth. I never drink the same thing here. Sometimes it's the brown bag special. Sometimes it's manhattan and martinis. They never disappoint. Very reasonably priced. It's also a great spot to celebrity spot and see B'way kids after their shows. It's three levels and each level has it's own style and charm."
"Came here for lunch with a good friend. I ordered the pizza uovo, which had a pesto sauce and egg over easy. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for a brunch-y dish since it was a weekday, but I wasn't that impressed. The bread was very soft and had a lovely texture, but I think that it had a lovely texture exactly for that: bread, not crust. No crunch in the crust at all, but the pancetta was a nice touch. I think I would have adored a slice of this pizza, maybe not the whole pizza. Dessert was a tres leche parfait -- pretty good, but a little heavy on the cake. Service was nice. Lunch isn't crowded at all, so it's a good spot for a quiet catch-up with friends."
"Awesome lunch special! $12.50 for everything!! Quality food that's cheap with large portions. Had the sanmizen. Everything was delicious. I really liked the steamed egg. It was seasoned well, and the sashimi was fresh too. Service was fast as well."
"Loved their curry. Â While walking in, I took a look at the Grand Slam and that thing was a huge muthafucka! Â So, I settled for the Chicken Curry. Â As soon as I sat down, I gorged on the chicken and curry. Â It was quite tasty. Â I also ordered the pickled shallots which added the right amount of acidity to the dish to awaken my palate. Â  The curry itself was darn good. Â I remember when I ate at Curry-Ya, I definitely thought I could make this curry on my own. Â But here, the curry has a bit of a unique taste. Â It has a kick with a bit of saltiness that I loved. Â  Minus one star for the cabbage. Â It smelled a little mildewy so I left that to the side. Â Actually, the next time I order, I'll probably ask them not to put it on my plate. Â Since I'm on my way to playwriting class tomorrow and it's two blocks away, I'm definitely going again to have a plate of curry. Â Probably I'll gorge on it like a pig like the last time, lol."
"I've been here so many times, I can't believe I've never written a review. Â This is a great spot to take people from out of town for a good vibe any time of the day. Â Plan on waiting as there is usually an abundance of people coming to enjoy the food. Â But there's plenty of bar space upstairs and a smaller bar downstairs for your imbibing pleasure. I recommend the gnudi (Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Crispy Sage) and the burger...with the roquefort cheese and shoe string fries. Â (Don't be afraid to scrape some off as it can be quite a lot). Â The banofi pie for dessert is sure to please as well. Â The gastro pub fare will surely set you up for the evening, so no matter what you chose it will likely be good. Â  The decor is very pig centric!"
"Awesome Sunday brunch experience here. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid brunch option in the LES. Pros: --Chicken and waffles were AMAZING. Chicken was tender and fried to perfection. The waffles were crisp, yet light and fluffy. They paired well with the house-made flavored butters provided. --Egg's benedict was delicious. I have tried egg's benedict at nearly every brunch spot I have been to, and this was one of the best. It was made with smoked chicken instead of ham. Very tasty, but bordered on the spicy side, so beware. --So many good drink options it was difficult to choose. I went with the peach iced tea. You can make it boozy by adding bourbon or vodka. Very refreshing. --The decor was very cute. It reminded me of hipster meets southern hospitality. --They take reservations! A rarity for brunch spots in NYC. --The dessert sounded amazing, but I didn't get a change to try it. Cons: --The seats were a little uncomfortable and the restaurant is a little cramped. Not a good place to bring large parties. As a fun fact, they serve vegetarian chicken and waffles. Not sure how it is, but could be worth a shot for the curious vegetarian!"
"this 1 michelin star restaurant was a complete disappointment. the taste of my mushroom ceviche with miso aubergines and ginger ponzu dish was way to strong. the mushroom itself tasted very nice but the sauce was overwhelmingly sour+salty+sweet sauce, probably overgenerous with its ponzu sauce. this ceviche+ponzu(citrusy+citrusy) dish drove me nuts. gulped a mouthful of water per bite of mushroom. grilled scallops with sweet chilli sauce, creme fraiche and green plantain crisps- scallop tasted a little raw on first bite, but improves on each subsequent bite. sweet chilli sauce+creme fraiche combo on top of the scallops were really nice though, although the ocassional taste of coarse salt was just too much. again, gulping down several mouthful of water for this dish. the sourness of my 2 appetizer dishes totally killed my taste buds and appetite for dessert. might go back to give it another go if i'm around the area and is too lazy to walk around. 1 star for scallops, one star for decor."
"Threw my boyfriend a surprised birthday party here on a Sunday night. The hostess at the door was not aware of the party being a surprise (although I was told over the phone that they put a note in) but thank god she caught on immediately when I started winking at her and trying to make her read my lips that i am saying ""its a surprise!!!"" LOL she immediately told another person to seat us to ""our table for 2"" and the person took us to our table where all our friends were! Birthday boy was surprised!!! I read a lot of tips and reviews before choosing this place so I knew what to order and we ordered a whole lot!!! Totally had the fried chicken with pancakes drizzled with honey--the boyfriend loved that. There were 2 beers in particular he wanted to try but they didnt have it that night so we will have to come back (brunch!). The pickles sampler was amazing! Loved every one of it!!!! The biscuits reminds me of corn bread but better--i totally fell in love with the spread..i think it has maple syrup in it and unsure what else was in it but it was so so so good. I had the pork belly mussels which was yummy. Mac and cheese was a must. Some people did order the turkey leg and thought it was dry. The drinks were strong enough and tasted good. Well, i did hear the bloody mary was a tad bit on the spicier side. The food was really good and everyone took home leftovers because we ordered way too many appetizers to begin with. But the whole party of 17 said the food was reaally good and they would definitely come back. They kept asking me where did i find this restaurant!!! (Thanks Yelpers!!! The staff was very attentive with refilling our drinks and i believe the manager (not sure of his position) even came over to make sure our party was ok and if we needed anything. The guys really liked the music that played all night lol boyfriend ended up asking the manager about his playlist. It was a little too dark in the back seating area. We all had to use our phone flash lights to read the menus LOL its probably brighter during the day but night time, it was dark! Overall, so happy to have picked this restaurant to celebrate the boyfriend's 28th birthday and he was so happy cos i found all his favorites in one spot -- beers biscuits pickles and fried chicken!!! We will definitely be back for brunch and some more!!!"
I went here on a Friday night with a group of friends and they were able to seat us right away which was nice since we had just come from trying to get a seat at Cafe Magador where the wait time was forty minutes. The food was alright. I got a lamb sandwich. It was pretty tasteless. This place didn't really have anything special or memorable about it. The service was pretty slow too. Overall it was just ok; I don't think I would come back here.
"more bistro style tapas! kitchen is super tiny, though fun to watch them try to cook everything for the restaurant on 6 burners! This makes the food a little hit or miss. came for dinner, it was 'meh'. Kinda like going to a friends house who knows how to cook really well and is inventive with meats. the Brunch however is great. Reasonably priced, inventive and tasty as hell (good bloody mary, though I wish it came in a pint glass!)"
"a great spot with lots of seating, a solid beer selection (rotating drafts--not the kind of place you'll be ordering a bud light), and very good food (including truffle popcorn and pretzels--yes, please). a friend and i came here a few months back to watch a world cup match, and while their were ample tv's all around, the place doesn't have a typical ""sports bar"" feel to it, but rather a ""warehouse/industrial"" sort of look. i also had my birthday happy hour here, which was great, but unfortunately, the waitress who was assigned to our table was sort of a bitch. OH WELL! will be back."
"Finally dragged the husband there. Â He tried the falafel, hummus and beet salad. Â I had the harissa falafel sandwich with everything on it again. Â All were delicious. Â  Best falafel around!"
"The best Thai food in Hell's Kitchen! Pricey, but most places in this neighborhood are. Everything I've ordered has been great. I love eating in there, too - nice relaxed ambiance, but a bit tight."
"We were greeted by Jared who was absolutely flawless. The service he provided was unreal. It lived up to its hype with impeccable food. Â After delicious sliders, we enjoyed a perfect pork chop and immaculate crispy chicken. We didn't think we had room for dessert but could not resist the out of this world beignet."
"After a long stroll in Prospect Park, Double Windsor is the place to rest your feet! The spot is spacious, inviting and chill. Order drinks at the bar, order food at the window (cash only). Although I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer selection is impressive! Fortunately, they had Angry Orchard Cider for me. Their fries were banging - brownie points for having Malt Vinegar available to drench them fries in! My friend had their mussels & frites - also very good. This will be my go-to bar whenever I'm in the area and/or dogsitting."
"43rd between 2nd and 3rd has become my favorite block. Sakagura, Soba Totto, Sushi Yasuda make a holy trinity of amazing Japanese restaurants, brought to you by the letter S. Sakagura is a lovely, cavernous restaurant, and it quite literally feels like a cave once you start spelunking down the series of stairs underground and losing your AT&T reception on the way. Â My brother and I made last minute reservations on a Monday, and they had a 7:15 pm availability at the bar. Â We arrived ravenous and left with satiated appetites, full but comfortably so, ordering: HIYAYAKKO : Â Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes Â $5.00 (solid, nothing extraordinary) IKA SHIOKARA : Â Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade Â $5.00 (warning: this was good but very salty) ONSEN TAMAGO : Â Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup Â $9.00 (the waiter recommended we each get one, but the uni was decent enough of a serving to be shared) SEAWEED SALAD : Â Assortment of Seaweed Topped with a choice of Citrus Vinaigarette OR Sesame Â $8.00 (the sesame dressing is incredible) SANMA ONIGIRI : Â Cooked Rice Balls with Shiitake Mushroom, Pickled Radish and Mountain Vegetables Wrapped with a Whole Baked Pike Mackerel [3pcs] Â $10.00 (this was wonderful-crispy rice balls wrapped in crispy mackerel) UNI SOBA $22 (honestly loved this more than the Uni Soba at Soba Totto and Soba Ya- the broth sets it apart from the rest) SESAME CRÃˆME BRULEE $9 (solid, nothing extraordinary) Like most Izakaya places, Sakagura is a great place to try a little bit of everything, and I will definitely come back to work my drunken way through the extensive sake menu."
"4.5 stars! This could've been a 5 stars if they didn't make a mistake on our order. We both got the fried chicken platter. One with tater tots & collard green as sides. The other one with creamy spinach & mashed potato. They messed up the order by giving us the tater tots & mashed potato. The other one got the collard green & creamy spinach. Well, it didn't really matter that much to us because we don't mind sharing & eating from each other plate. This could've been annoying if say, we're not a couple because wouldn't want to eat from somebody else plate. The food was absolutely delicious. Everything from the fried chicken with gravy, corn bread & the sides, they were all so delicious! We really can't complaint about the food quality. The food has so much flavor! We were definitely happy with our food. The portion is also pretty decent. Well, if you're starving & have a huge appetite, you'd better off going to Popeyes for the fried chicken because most likely you won't be full. The service was good, Our waitress was polite & friendly. The place is small but pretty cozy & comfy. We got there around 6pm & there was few people eating there. All total, we spent about $28 for our meals. Overall, even with the minor mistake, we were happy with our dining experience there. If you happen to be around the area, this place is definitely worth trying."
This place is excellent...the inside is rustic with a cute flair...the food was great. We had the baked oatmeal (amazing!). It comes in a huge bowl filled with milk..the oatmeal with raisins was like a warm cookie. I got the egg croissant with bacon which was loaded with bacon (and didn't include much fatty pieces).
Delicious hot and sour soup and chicken and broccoli. Steaming fresh and hot. Love this hole in the wall.
This is a good place to go with friends and maybe a date. I have been here three times and out of all three times the food has always been consistent. My favorite dishes is the seafood pasta. The price is right on the money as it is very reasonable for the large portion that they do give you. The mussels with the white sauce is definitely a good appetizer for you to try. Service is always consistent but make sure that you get their little early because the line is usually pretty long.
"been around forever the best soup base of any pho restaurant in chinatown! prices are cheap food comes out quick waiters are fast definitely order the spring rolls! freshly fried and the outter layer is extremely crunchy if you eat it fresh. their other location ""Grand Bo Ky"" im not too sure of, not even sure why they opened that one recently."
"My friend and I came here last night. It seems small and narrow when you enter but when you head toward the back, it's more spacious and there's more seating. I would suggest getting there early to get a seat because the place quickly filled up. They had options for everyone and they were all cheap! We were chiding ourselves for not coming on a Wednesday but it was still ridiculously low-priced. A large glass of sangria (albeit, it was more like slightly carbonated juice than an alcoholic beverage) was only $3. There were $1 sandwiches all the way to $2.50 sandwiches (I think that's the highest priced sandwiches, but my memory is a bit hazy). Definitely order the potatoes bravas. They're cheap and I really liked them. The sandwiches are small (tapas style, obviously) but tasty. The best sandwiches ever? Definitely not, but good enough for the price! It is a comfortable place to be. I docked a star because when we entered, we weren't entirely sure what to do. Do we seat ourselves? How do we place the order? Does the waiter come by and pick up the order? We were fumbling a bit but finally got the hang of it. Basically, you seat yourself. There's a notepad where you write down your order. Then, you bring up the order to the bar, pay for it beforehand, then sit back down. You will hear your order and name over the loudspeaker and you go back to pick up Â your food. It's a very young crowd - college students but it is a fun place to go. I'd come back here for cheap and small eats!"
"Came here yesterday at around 12:30, the line was very long with people shopping for christmas gifts, i waited for about 30 mins... This is my second time to the laduree in nyc and they are just so pretty inside... The whole place screams Paris to me and really makes me miss my trip to paris... I believe most of the people working in there are french as I heard them spoke french to one another. Â  I ordered the rose petal, chocolate coconut and the christmas special flavor. Â Rose petal is my all time favorite. Â Christmas flavor was really delicious too w the taste of raspberry and chocolate. Â I really like the softness of the shell but I feel its lacking a little chewiness that Pierre Herme is known for. They also sell other goodies like jam, tea etc. however it is extremely chaotic and confusing if you do want to buy other goodies besides macarons as the servers are too busy w the macaron line, this is why i am taking one star off. Hope the soho location will be open soon and I will def check it out!"
"Surely, its a must to make reservation as the wait will be very long. I went for brunch and there is alway people waiting. But its really worth the wait. I particularly love the bread as well as the service. The brunch came with an entree and cocktail so i would say that its a pretty good deal. I had the popular Benedict Jane which was egg and crab cake. It was really good if you like this kind of stuff. Will definitely come again."
"Can't ever go wrong with Cafeteria. They have the best Chicken & Waffles, cocktails are good (Old Fashioned is great). Some other dishes I'd recommend are the Truffle Mac and Cheese & also their Eggs Benedict. Also, a really nice atmosphere. Music gets a little loud sometimes (usually later on at night), but still a great place for a date or to just grab some good food"
"My friends and I wandered to Num Pang after one of my friends stated that her sister had raved about this place. According to Yelp, this is a Cambodian Sandwich shop. While I am always down for trying new places, I was a little skeptical about Num Pang, especially because my friend's sister had declared that it was better than Joju. But regardless, my friends and I ventured to find Num Pang. We went to the one that is near Union Square, which is certainly a hole in the wall (literally). In my opinion, this hole in the wall was a bit difficult to find, especially because it is precisely a hole in the wall. My friends and I overlooked this location in trying to find it, but in the end, we finally found it. When we walked up to the shop, it was a little strange; there was nobody waiting in line, and considering it was such a nice day out, that seemed a little suspicious. However, this little sandwich shop is competing with big name brands around Union Square, including a Chipotle that is right across the street from it - so I gave it some slack. The menu is small and this place gives off a homely vibe. You order from the window and you can take your sandwich and eat it in Union Square or walk up the stairs and people watch while you eat on the second floor. I had the pepper corned catfish sandwich. I was going to order their pork belly sandwich, but the cashier told me that they had run out of pork belly. Boo-hoo. However, the catfish sandwich was good enough. There are a blend of flavors in this sandwich, and I certainly thought it was delicious although it could have used less pepper. But hey, I'm not complaining. All in all, I think that this hole in the wall around Union Square is a good place to eat. Whether or not it is better than Joju has yet to be determined. I would definitely come back here again, or maybe try their other locations. This location is cash only, which is a little annoying, especially when you never have cash on you."
So my husband and i.came here yesterday.. the food was good.. the chicken w/basil is not my thing... the shrimp.dumpling with spicy sauce was filled with cilantro. I wish the amount of cilantro was less.. didnt know they put that much of it.. the soy.sauc was diluted.. lol.. idk why.. but it was.. i will.come back but never will i order abythig with spicy sauce
"One of the best Sicilian slices in the city, all. 5 boroughs. L&B has been serving up Brooklyn for years. The upside down Sicilian slice. He'll yea I'm a fan. Great dough, sauce, and cheese. That's it , simple! I hear they have great spumoni as well. Time to go back and check it out."
"So this is a pick-up experience. ( I was taking it out. ) I wanted the pineapple fried rice with shrimp which is what I was craving. Their english isn't very good and in the end I wondered if my order would be right after I got there. The order was already ready by the time I got there 10 minutes later but there were maybe two tables occupied then at 1:30pm. The total was around $9. The portion was decent. The rice dish wasn't bad Â but it didn't knock my socks off either. I've had better. However even with that said, I'll try them again and maybe go and sit down and have dinner. The restaurant was modern yet had a Thai feel."
The Arepas are great and its usually not too crowded good chioce for Brunch.
"Get the pork belly!!!!!!! Just wanted you to know that if you stop reading my review. Was in the area and was looking for a quick bite. Friend of mine told me about this place and it was 4pm and empty so in i went. Great wine list. So many things on the menu i wanted to try. My friend wasn't very hungry so we split the Hudson Valley Pork Charcuterie and Terrine Board, Spanish Cheese, House Pickles. Every part of the pig was turn into a delicious plate of food. And as i mentioned we had the Pork Belly Canary Islands with Maple Bananas and Lime. BOOM was like bacon bubblicious. Had to fight for the last piece. Plan on going back until I've had everything on the menu. I drank the ""B"" koolaid and i'm all in"
"My friend and I popped in here for a quick, small meal. We each ordered a cheeseburger slider each and we shared the cheese fries because we heard it was good. On the table, you will notice that there is jalapeÃ±o ketchup, barbecue and ketchup. The jalapeÃ±o ketchup was my favorite. I would come back here just for that because I'm obsessed with anything spicy and jalapeÃ±o. The sliders were good. But not amazing. They're definitely one of the better ones I've tried. But I can't say which ones are the best . Because, well, they're just sliders. This is good if you want a quick and small meal. The cheese fries were okay. Good at first but then towards the middle, they get soggy. And I hate soggy fries. I know, kinda obvious since we got cheese on top, but it would've been better if they crisped it up more. And the fries are too oily. You can just tell by looking at it. If I come back, I'm probably just going to get sliders. No more cheese fries for me. And regular fries look too oily."
"I came here during the hurricane and have been rather delinquent with writing this review... Anywho, this place rocks. They were open by candlelight even when there wasn't power anywhere in the area. If that doesn't show dedication, I don't know what does. Even though due to the Hurricane they had a limited menu everything was delicious! I love Mexican food and this spot is the real deal. It's a cozy little spot with a lot of character, regardless of whether it's candlelight only. The drinks are out of this world and strong. The spicy ones are quite spicy!"
"This place is simply delightful. Â Great service, amazing wine and delicious, hand-crafted pizza made fresh when you order it. Â The outdoor garden is a great place to have dinner; I'll be back soon!"
"Great pork belly! I always seem to overeat the meat here though. My sister really liked the pickles - they were more natural. Â I would definitely say though, that this place is clearly for meat lovers, as there isn't a whole lot else to eat. Â If you only order one thing though, definitely get the pork belly. The sausages were good, the ribs okay, the brisket is good. ugh, too much meat, but very tasty! They have nice benches outside as well if you want to sit outside, and a really cute wall with all these different cuts of meats painted on it."
"Fantastic! Â Had the lamb gyro with the works. Â Delicious. Â The pita was perfectly grilled, the lamb perfectly cooked, and the hot sauce had so much flavor, it was amazing. And the guys in there are so friendly. Â I'll go back often, for sure."
"Crowded for Sunday brunch. The brunch menu includes an entire meal with drink but service was slow, and the steak and eggs dish was not satisfying...apparently the meat was way too tough. I liked the cider and liked my poached eggs. It was not overdone. Most of us were still hungry afterwards though :(. Would have liked for a bigger meal because some in the group came 1.5 hours for this! Keep in mind avenue C really is pretty darn far. It's a 25 minute walk from Bloomie's Soho! The decor reminds me a done up barn-house with all the unfinished wood panels and thick white rope reminiscent of a chill saloon offering Austrian food. Overall it was good and we were not rushed out in our large group of 9, especially since we hardly see each other. We were thankful for that! A bit bustling but that's fine. Service was good, just slower than expected."
"I've never had shawarma until I came to Mamoun OMG it was unbelievable yummy. Had a side of hummus ummm to die for, or maybe I was just hungry lol.. This place is great after a night of drinking. Beware of the long lines to order lol."
"We came at quarter to 12 and there was already a line in front of us! I thought I was in for really good stuff since this place pulled New Yorkers from their beds before lunchtime on a Saturday. We were finally called at 1pm. Considering there was only two of us, I honestly expected for us to be seated sooner. When I walked in, I understood why there's a line and why the table for two took so long. This is a really tiny place, but a good thing is you smell the aroma from the broth all over the restaurant. We were seated at the bar, thank God it was winter time or I'm sure we would've died from the heat. The guy behind the bar was nice enough to suggest toppings that would go good with our choices. The service was pretty quick too! We ordered the pork buns, tuna, and I got the chicken paitan ramen while my friend got the spicy ramen. The pork buns were okay, a little too fatty for me and my friend shared the same sentiment. Lol. The tuna was a little more salty than we had hoped - this was disappointing since we read a lot of good reviews about it. As for the ramen, the broth was thick and flavorful! At first bite, or shall I say slurp, it's like a burst of flavors in your mouth.. Unfortunately, since it was a little thicker than most broths, the yumminess faded away :( In a nutshell, I don't know if I'd come back. Food was good but nothing special. And oh, they don't do take out so make sure you finish your food!"
"Ok.. so I may not be completely with the majority here but the experience at Barrio was not what I expected. Â  First off, my disclosure is blatantly stated here: Â I think I may be allergic to tequila as I had a bad reaction to it the night I drank here. Â I'm not sure what type of tequila was in the grapefruit magarita but it didn't do me any wonders. Â I'll spare you the details but I woke up itchy and apparently my body was rejecting whatever I ingested. Â Tip: If you're allergic to tequila, don't do it! Booo hoooooo Barrio. Â  Michelada was the best thing we ordered.... highly recommend. The two types of tacos we got were good... one was the calamari and the other a fish. Â The calamari added dimension and texture to the otherwise bland taco. Â So I didn't partake in the 3 cup condiments bestowed upon us... okay my fault. Â Tip: Â try the condiments or you'll be eating unseasoned food! Â  Please learn from my mistakes folks or you'll remember Barrio Chino the same way I can't forget it."
"Went here for lunch today - second time. Â I called and they offered only two seating times - I had to call the morning of to confirm and my table would be given away if I didn't show up w/in 10 minutes of my reservation. Â Sat at a table the first time and spent over $90. Â This time, sat in front of a sushi bar and spent much less (ordered prix-fixe instead). Â Sushi bar is definitely the way to go - love the pacing of sushi and the fact that one chef is designated to serve you and your guest. Not sure if this is the best sushi I've ever had - don't get me wrong, the sushi is good, but is it the greatest? Â No. I thought the medium fatty toro was much better than the bluefin tuna. Â I tried both sashimi and sushi and I find the sushi to be more wholesome. Â  Will I go back again? Â Probably not since there are many good sushi restaurants out there that I haven't tried yet."
"The octopus appetizer portion is almost big enough to be a main and is really good. Â And I'm a big fan of the lemon chicken. Â  Have eaten here in person and also gotten deliveries through Seamless. Â Always a good meal, and I'm never left hungry."
"Super cute, cozy and inviting place that just opened this week, which I've been eyeing and been wanting to try out. Â Really nice rustic/warm ambiance, looks like they put a lot of care into the design and decor of the restaurant. Had dinner here with my bf and friend the other night, and the three of us shared the vegetarian Farmer's Market Feast. The portions didn't look large, but plate after plate kept arriving to our table and it was all delicious and deceptively filling. Seriously, food was really good, and you can definitely taste it in the quality and fresh ingredients. It really was like a chef's tasting menu, and I didn't expect food executed at this level in this off-the-beaten path area. Everything was great but some memorable plates were the beet frites, smoked goat cheese tart, spaghetti squash bolognese (despite the name, we verified that this dish is actually vegetarian, along with the rest of the Farmer's Market Feast). Friend also had the steak & eggs off their ala carte menu and he really enjoyed the steak. They also have root beer on tap, and I felt like a kid having a big mug of it with my fancy meal, but it was really refreshing. Meal was finished off with an apple crumble that came with a little pot of creme fraiche. The servers were really attentive, and they also mentioned that they will be offering breakfast and dinner service for now, with lunch service to come soon. Baking is apparently done on premises. I work nearby and definitely plan to revisit for some coffee and baked treats in the morning!"
"Great seafood place !!! And the Red, white and blue comes with free wine !!!"
"The sandwiches are huge and freshly prepared no matter what time of day. We live in the area and will be back for our sandwich cravings. Super fun, creative sandwiches to choose from that when I go I change my mind a few times before ordering!"
Loved this place. Vanessa's is going to be my go to dumpling restaurant in Chinatown! Only negative is they didn't have cups...
"Pretty standard burger, I'm not sure it quite lived up to the hype. I also had the fries which reminded me of the ridged ones from elemantary school, besides the nostalgia I would probably pass on those although the cheese sauce we got made it better. I got a malted peanut butter shake which was the highlight of the meal. I guess why this place is called Shake Shack and not Burger Shack. I would go again but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."
"An Irish bar in Murray Hill??? Shut the f*ck up. No way! I had heard about the burgers at this place being great so I decided to come here for lunch one day with my buddy. There's something weird about eating lunch in the dark when there is perfectly good daylight outside. It seems to be the case with a lot of restaurants in this city. I can only imagine that their establishment lacks sources of natural lighting. In any case, I quickly got over the dark dingy feel of the place. We were, after all, in an Irish bar, where anything one normally finds objectionable about a food establishment can be considered here, thematic. Rude waitresses with a heart of gold? Check. Saw dust on the floor along with other nondescript compost? Check. Overrated skills at pouring Guinness from a spout? Check. With all the usual features befitting an Irish drinking establishment of fine repute, we sat down to order. Now, it's been a while since my visit, so I can't tell you what I actually ordered that day. The selection of burgers is extensive, but the permutations of bacon, mushroom, cheese, and onions are nothing that you haven't see before at various other burger joints across the city. What you, my friend, care about, is the meat. You want to know if it's juicy and flavorful and cooked medium, just the way you ordered it. Well, the answer is yes, yes, and yes. This burger was not as big as say, the burgers at Paul's or Jackson Hole, but what it lacked in quantity, it made up for in quality. It was satisfying and delicious, and as with all great burgers, it made me feel like a fat piece of sh*t afterwards for eating the whole thing. The Guinness was about $7 a glass and the burger around $15. Not the cheapest meal you can have around these parts but certainly not the most expensive. If you're looking for a dingy Irish bar to day drink with good company and chow down on some scrumptious beef patties, this is as good a place as any in this city."
"Really airy open low key but big flavor brunch spot! The staff was very accommodating, friendly and efficient. Love the relaxed vibe. Sunday brunch was amazing, blue fish cakes, grits, quesadillas, French toast you name it they have it. Good for groups, and worth the wait. Sunday farmers market outside when your done enjoying brunch, overall the perfect Sunday brunch spot ;)"
"Oh, yes, this place lived up to the hype. Â The macarons here are good. Â The service is excellent. Â I went during lunchtime on a weekday and there was absolutely no line. Â There is a framed display in the front with pictures of the macarons and their flavors. Â I just wished there were little tags next to each macaron selection behind the glass with the names of the flavors instead of having to refer back to the single main picture. Â They also offer limited time special flavors not found on this menu that need to be explained by the salesperson. Â It can get annoying trying to decide what you want if there is a huge line. Â The salesperson helping me was very attentive and patient with explaining the different flavors. Â I also bought a financier and a madeleine cookie. Â I wasn't so sure about the financier at first because it had such a hard exterior. Â My mind was changed after one bite. Â The interior was soft and flavorful. Â Definitely better than those I've had at Financier Patisserie but it does come at double the price. Â The madeleine was good and on par with those from other stores. Â I'd still say that La Maison du Macaron is my favorite place for macarons. Â They seem to have more of the plain fruitful flavors that I like (e.g. mango, strawberry, blood orange, passion fruit) whereas Laduree has more unique flavors (e.g. rose petal, strawberry & mint, black currant & violet). Â Maison is also a more convenient location for me and a quick walk from the F train."
"Taco spot tucked away in Essex market. Â Could have easily missed it if we weren't looking. Â We were craving chorizo tacos...they were not on the menu but the gentleman made them for us. Â We also had the pork and chicken. Â  Solid tacos, great and satisfying, Â but nothing earth shattering. Â I thought they were pricey for tacos, but they were substantial."
"Camw on monday afternoon. We were able to get a seat right away but every table was full. Â The water took a long time to come and we had to ask for it. We ordered cheese ravoli, a round pie with sausage and my friends split a chicken parmesan hero. The food was pretty good but very filling. I think the two slices of pizza would have been enough for me. I didn't think the pizza was very special. The crust was soft but the sausage was very greasy. The sausage came in smoked strips like bacon...I wish it wasn't like that."
"Red, White & Blue. If you don't know what that is and you love raw bar, go to Fish and order one now. Â You get 6 oysters or clams along with a glass of your choice of house white or red, or a Pabst beer. It is hard to find good quality and a good deal in the city nowadays and Fish nails it. The prices here are the best I have seen. I only really order raw bar from here and it is super fresh and warranted many returns to Fish for optimal seafood enjoyment. Â They do this thing with the Kumamoto oyster that brings a smile to my face every time I enjoy one on the half shell. They have a nice accompaniment of libation to wet your whistle whilst you wriggle those shellfish out of their shells Â :oD"
Food is always 5 stars but their service is always 2-3 stars. I order soup dumplings right away since they would take a while. Tables sat down after me received their tea and I told the waiter. He said it's coming and then went to take care of other customers instead of fetching me tea. The second waiter I asked was surprised and said I was with the two girls next to me. Â I reminded him we had order food separately. He came back in a few minutes and asked if I wanted anything else. I told him i just need another minute. Â He never came back to check on me. Â I could have doubled the check but he was too lazy to come back. Then the bill came with 15% tip already added whether service was good or bad. Â  They also round UP your bill when going change. Â My bill was $7.61. Â I was going to give then $20.01 but can use the few pennies. Â They gave me back Â $11.35. Â So my bill was up to $7.65. I know places that would round down their customer's bill. Â  Yeah it's only 4 cents. Â But you know how many bills the process each day. Â 4 cents becomes 4 dollars then 40 dollars....
"came here for brunch last saturday - hey, is winter finally over?? - with a couple of friends and their 11mo old child. they were accomodating of the child (after all, park slope is hipster parent haven), but oddly asked that the carriage be left outside (which they chained to a metal bar)... i say oddly, because another couple had their carriage standing next to their table. but anyway, i digress... also, the outdoor area was strangely closed, but we came an hour before brunch was ending so maybe they were prepping for dinner service... who knows. the pictures of the outdoor garden were a major selling point for coming here, so i found it strange that the biggest bonus they had over neighboring joins was CLOSED. the staff was super nice and helpful, the food was quite good, but the drinks and pricing (to some extent) made me give this place 3 stars. the beers - $12 for a regular bottle seems a bit excessive, even in 2014. the sake bloody mary didnt taste quite like sake, or quite like a bloody mary.... the food was, as i said, good. my friend got the turkey burger which he enjoyed, while his wife got the meatballs in 6hr sauce, which she was also happy with. they looked a bit dry to me, but i didnt try them so i may have been wrong. i had the huarache with braised chicken, which i quite enjoyed, especially with a nice dollop of oaxaca cheese, but the sauce was a bit spicy for me. not a knock on the place, but i shouldve known better! in all, its a decent spot, but i cannot say that anything truly stands out that would make me pick this place over the myriad other locations in the area. maybe drinks in the outdoor garden on a warm summer eve would make me return."
Time to do some complicated meatball math: Me + 1 Friend + Alcohol + 4 Meatballs (Beef and Marinara) / 2 Forks + Park Bench - $7 = 4 Yelp Stars Excellent take out drunk-food.
"I've been to Vesta twice and loved it both times. Bought a bottle of wine, first time red, second time white, can't remember the names but both were very good. The last time I went about 2 weeks ago I got the pasta with butternut squash and it was one of the best pastas I have ever eaten. Delish!"
"Had dinner with a girlfriend here last night and the meal was deeeeeeelish! Â I can't wait to try it one of these weekends for brunch! Â Although I hear its pretty crowded for brunch. Â We arrived for dinner a little after 6 and were seated right away. Â For the next hour or so we sat w/ only a few other small groups in the restaurant. Â By 8-ish when we left the place was packed. After reading through their pretty nice menu we deiced on a pitcher of sangria and a mac and cheese app to start. Â Both were fabulous. Â The mac and cheese was the perfect start- it was so creamy and perfectly cooked. Â  Next we opted to split two meals.. the Arugula and Warm Chicken Meatball Salad and the Warm Brie & Green Apple sandwich with ham. Â The meatballs were seasoned just right and when paired with the arugula and pesto vinaigrette it was perrrrrfect. Â I could have easily enjoyed another plate of these.. but I had half a sandwich to enjoy! Â The brie, apple adn ham combo was very good. Â Not as fabulous as the meatballs but still pretty tasty. After eating and drinking all of that you'd think we'd be stuffed but there is something about the lightness of the food that fills you up but doesn't make you feel like the fat kid at the table. Â We decided we both needed dessert and tried the cupcakes. Â While the vanilla vanilla was a little dry (according to my friend) the vanilla with mocha frosting was moist and very good! Â While I wouldn't go there just for the cupcakes I'd definitely cap off my meal with one. Overall a great experience at Penelope. Â I'm looking forward to my next visit!"
Delicious ramen noodles and a decent Sake collection. I went for lunch but I think this place is better for dinner because you will end up eating a fair amount of food. I look forward to returning.
"Had a chicken pot pie that wasn't bad, just a bit bland and my friends burger was good. Â The decor is pretty cool, very whimsical place for after work or to grab a drink if you're in the area. Â They also have a few tv screens."
"The Brunch was AMAZING, a very good deal and the food was delicious. The per-person cost was a bit high but the amount of food and drinks that are included is the best value you can get around Queens. The wait might take some time but if you're patient you'll most likely enjoy your meal."
BRUNCH is a must. Dinner I have not. Love love the olive oil muffin (I been replicating the recipe at home). Soft ricotta pancakes !!! THICK cut bacon !! Casual staff who remembers my name and always works to find me a seat.
"Very cute, large restaurant hidden away down a few steps from the street. We got to sit on the second floor by the window, so got a great view of lovely West 10th St. It involved walking through the kitchen too, so got to sneak a peek into there. So many wonderful tapas choices that I think I could come back time and again (a little on the pricey side, so that's what will rein me in...). My biggest impression was just that I felt... surprised by each dish. There was just something about the ingredients or the way that they prepared every dish that was creative and pleasantly unexpected from what I had imagined. Also, fair warning: really strong sangria!"
"I think this was as good as Setagaya for me. Â I ordered the spicy miso and it shortly came out. Â Wow, it was a huge bowl. Â I don't know where I found room to fit it, since I had just eaten at Setagaya (am on a quest to visit as many ramen-yas in NYC as possible). Â I would say of the four ramen-yas we ate at, Minca and Setagaya are tied for the top, with Totto at the bottom. Â Terakawa was fine. Â Ippudo, which we ate at years ago, is still the golden standard, though it will be a long time before I'll set foot in the NYC location. Â Still, with Ippudo as an outlier, I do think that the standards for ramen-yas here are not as high as elsewhere. Â Back to Minca, I would definitely return here when we're in the area. Â I'd also like to try the nearby Kubaya."
"My girlfriend and I ate here last night to celebrate her finishing her hospital integration rounds and upcoming Columbia graduation. I made our initial reservation for Tuesday at 8 on Monday evening. On Tuesday morning, I changed it to 7:30 and there were still plenty of times available. Perry Street is a bit out of the way and a pain to reach - there are no subways around the corner - but the food and location are worth it. The restaurant is across the street from the river and features a typical minimalist, but still nice Jean-Georges interior. On to the food. For those who didn't know, Jean-Georges' son is the executive chef here at Perry Street. They started off with a complimentary amuse bouche of fava beans and a pea soup of sorts, drizzled on crostini. It was slightly spicy and very yummy. For appetizers, we had the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna and the Chilled Peekytoe Crab Salad. The tuna was delicious. Due to the rice cracker crust, I couldn't tell if the outside was seared, but the inside was definitely sashimi style. The crab salad, on the other hand, was not good. It wasn't rancid crab meat, but there were certain flavors mixed together in there that just didn't work. For entrees, I had the lamb chops and she had the butter poached lobster. The lamb chops, which currently aren't on the online menu, cost $38 and the lobster, which doesn't have a price on the online menu, is $35. Both were quite delicious, juicy and succulent. I had my lamb medium rare with no complaints. The lobster comes with a lemongrass and kaffir lime broth, served on the side and I'd suggest keeping it on the side. The lobster definitely tastes better without any sauce. For dessert, we split the trio of sorbets, choosing mandarin, ginger pear and green apple. All tasted like we were eating real fruit, tho the mandarin could've been a bit more flavorful. For beverages, we mainly stuck with water, tho I did have the Vodka Thyme Lemonade, which I'd recommend. No complaints about the staff. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating, answering any questions and making sure that all was well. Besides the complaint about the crab salad, the only other complaint is the dimly lit interior of the restaurant, which borders on being poorly lit so that it's difficult to see what you're eating. While there is still daylight outside, this isn't a problem, but once the sun goes down, it gets pretty dark inside as well. As for peoples' attire, it was all over the place. The guy sitting next to me had a v-neck undershirt and jeans, while other people had suits. All in all, a very good restaurant. The crab salad and poorly lit interior are the only things preventing me from awarding a 5 star rating. As long as you don't mind going a bit out of your way, Perry Street is a good destination."
"Was very excited for this but thought it disappointed a bit. If it weren't for scoutmob I would've felt it was very overpriced. Tuna handrolls were very good, Cornish game hen was good but just expensive..I think like $27. Good service though."
"Nice place with a great and cozy atmosphere, we sad downstairs which was really nice. God place to start before going out in the weekend - because they make great cocktails. The food was really nice as well - we had a couple of different dishes we shared. Â  The only bad thing I have to say is about our Â waiter he was not very good - very disapointed. Â So the stars is only for the food and the drinks..."
"If you ever feel the need to punish your heart with absurd amounts of heavy cream and sausage - this is the place for you. The pastries are amazing (read: butter), as well as the coffee. You can even get full meals, but that didn't seem to be the main draw. It is pretty classy without being pretentious. The service was prompt and nice. I think the prices are really high (for what amounts to an extravagant coffee house) , but if you want to eat right on central park, you have to pay."
"I am one of those who ended up at Rye at the behest of a friend who became somewhat incoherent describing their meatloaf sandwich. Â I was to discover there's more to like at this all-around excellent neighborhood restaurant. Decor is masculine, yet accessible. Â Channels old-fashioned saloon, with sleek dark-wood furniture and columns, very dim lighting at night. Â Their oft-noted cocktails can be had at their comfortable bar, or to accompany the very good food menu, which is trim, diverse, and appealing. Â The food skews toward hearty, the style New American, with inspirations and ingredients both international and local. Â A prix fix three-course meal is also offered. Rye's famed meatloaf sandwich, listed under their ""Favorites"" section, is truly marvelous. Â Arguably, I'm already biased, being fond of meatloaf, meatballs, and the like, but this beauty was decadent, succulent, and a flavor bomb. Â Rye makes the meatloaf with a quartet of meats (beef, veal, pork, duck), and sandwiches a huge hunk of it between crusty bread, crispy buttermilk fried onions, and lettuce smothered in a creamy sauce. Â The experience of eating it is hard to describe, although blissful works. Â So good was it that I've had it (or at least a slice of it) at every visit, and I rarely repeat entrees. The rest of the food selection is not to be overshadowed. Â Rye has a lot of good food options, well-prepared and flavored. Â Fried brussels sprouts, showered in shaved parmesan, is an especial highlight. Â The four cheese Mac and cheese sports a nice char and never-can-be-wrong bacon. Â Grilled shrimp and scallop kebab was perfectly cooked and served with a refreshing, tart tomato salad. Â Scotch egg one-ups the classic preparation with a crispy panko crust, coming pre-sliced in two with a delicious cheese sauce. Â The single disappointment I can recall was a fried chicken on special that was dry and somewhat lacking in flavor, although the crust was delicious and the accompanying mashed potatoes fluffy, buttery, and addictive. Despite the cocktail rep, I've more often had beers. Â Their cocktails are a good price for Brooklyn, and I'd consider it worthwhile to enjoy one at the bar with a few small plates. Â Also a good list of spirits and wines. Rye is a great place for drinks and food. Â The ambience is laid-back and service friendly. Â And that meatball sandwich is unbelievable, enough that I have to return periodically for."
This restaurant fits perfectly in TriBeCa. I had the fire- roasted garlic chicken and was very pleased. Waiter was very nice and accommodating. We sat in the front area which seemed to be a little cafe during the day. Great people watching.
"Our crew took a night out for a final summer gathering here, including my yelp besties, Amy S. & Derrick L. In short: Truffle burger - was really short on the truffle cheese & glaze, especially after such a crazy long wait. Â We were able to ask for a little extra on the burger and this was said to taste very good. Hatch burger - the spicy burger, ordered by yours truly. Â Good amount of spice (not crazy though, goes without masking the burger meat flavor, which is good). Â I must say i love their buns, probably one of the best burger buns i've had. 5 spice duck burger - it is salty & saucy, make sure to have plenty of beverage to go with it. Cali burger - seems like a safe burger with lettuce, tomato & cheese... our buddy said it tasted good, too. Fries - this was the first thing to arrive @ the table and we inhaled it... SADLY, we didn't get any dipping sauce until we were more than halfway done with the fries. Â Can the Umami people seriously consider bringing the sauce WITH the fries? Â Cuz i know we aren't the first review to mention this Ice cream sandwiches - SILLY us, we didn't wait for it to defrost before chomping it all down... Future diners, definitely wait a few mins for it to defrost and then consume, it tastes so much better that way. Â The table's favorites were Sunkissed ginger, Good Wich, then the Choco peanut butter. Except for the only true lady @ the table, the rest of the guys & i were NOT full from our meal... our only dissatisfaction (besides the fries sauce thing) was that the portion really was too small for the price paid... So people, don't come here expecting to get full on 1 burger, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert. Â Next time, we're trying the Umami noodle shop~"
"I've been a customer to this tiny little East Village shop for years. Â The quality of the fries have stayed consistently good and the only real change over the years is how much longer the line gets as it's reputation grew and grew over time. Â From what used to be just out to the door is now a line that could stretch to the next two buildings' entrance. Â All this for a place that thrives solely on serving up fresh hot Belgian Frites, a few soft drinks and nothing else. The interior of the shop is very small with most of the space being taken over by by the kitchen/frying area behind the counter. Â When you are squeezing your way to place your order, it's very highly likely that someone would be trying to squeeze their way old the door with their newly received order. Â Your sense of personal space must be set aside momentarily as long as you are within the shop. Â Extreme claustrophobics need not apply. Â There is a very limited amount of space in the back where you could sit and eat although I highly recommend taking it outdoors and eating it nearby if the weather is pleasant enough. Because of the popularity of the place, the Belgian frites, which is essentially a thicker cut of potatoes that is fried twice to give a crispier exterior and softer interior, are sold so fast that every few minutes, a new batch is made. Â Your frites are sure to be piping hot and minutes old. There are three cone sizes that you could choose from. Â Big, bigger, and ""oh my god are you planning to feed godzilla with that?"" Â or as they call it, regular, large, and double. For anyone that have trouble making a decision, they are sure to have a fun time with Pommes Frites' impressively large selection of sauces. Â Not counting the free original frite sauces, as of this review, they have 20 plus premium sauces that are $1 each and $2.50 for 3. Â To give you an idea of some of the broad range of flavors, there is Organic Black Truffle Mayo (This is the only sauce costing $1.75), Peanut Satay, Wasabi Mayo, Curry Ketchup and many more. They also serve poutine here. Â Poutines is a popular Canadian dish where they smother the fries with gravy, and is sprinkled with lumps of cheese curds. Â In place of thinner fries used in Canada, this place naturally uses their frites instead which in my opinion, doesn't work as well. Â I also think the gravy was a bit on the salty side. Â It's still the best poutine that I've found in NYC thus far, which is less of a praise of the poutine served here and more of the sorry state of poutines in our city. Â It's not bad, just not great."
"Wow, I've lived in NYC for so long, and just got myself in here for the first time the other day. Â I had no idea that this place existed. Â It has a whole pay per pound buffet station, and ready made food! Â I found that the ready-made food was cheaper (probably because you don't get much choice), so if you like Korean food, and need a quick meal, check this place out for sure! Â Excited to go back and try different foods!"
"Not quite sure why this place is so popular. Had dinner here on a Saturday night, the wait wasn't too bad. Got seated at the bar. It was quite loud, so probably not the best place to go if you want to have a intimate conversation with someone. Since the steamed pork belly bun was highly raved, we got an order of that along with an order of buffalo pork bun and spicy pork sausage & rice cakes. The buns were OK. Didn't think they were that much better than other places... Rice cakes got a nick crunch on the outside, again, wasn't overly impressed. All in all, this place is not bad, but it doesn't stand out from the million restaurants in the city either."
"On an evening walk in search of dinner, we ended up here. The signage simply says ""Korean BBQ"". Â We were sold. (I later realized this is Kimchi grill, as in Kimchi grill the food truck). You can rent a food truck, you know? Â For like big events, or parties, or for fun. Anyway. The menu is simple. I got a spicy chicken burrito. I asked for it to be extra spicy (they do not mess around). It was really spicy.. but really delicious. They also give you cucumber water. Nice touch. It seems I like fusion places. I would say this is Mexican Korean Fusion. So this place has my seal of approval, whatever that is worth. Readers digest version: Nice spot. Chill open air seating area, fast/friendly service, spicy food. And cucumber water."
"Cramped downstairs, but a nice upstairs with live music. The punches are fun to share."
"No frills, finger-licking place. Â I haven't been to many NYC burger joints but this has the best local burger in the east village. Â Perfect size, juicy and ordered to your liking. Â If you're craving beer + burger + low key night...come here! Â You won't be disappointed and you will still have tons of money in your wallet."
"Went on a date here recently. It's a cute little, homey belgian bistro. We got a bottle of white wine and started with a cheese plate and caesar salad. The caesar salad was cute and served in little boats. I loved all the cheeses and it was pretty big. We then got some moules frites and they were pretty yummy. Definitely a cute little neighborhoody spot. I've also ordered the burger here for delivery and it is pretty yummy as well."
Came here for dinner and the food was good. Â We enjoyed everything we ordered including the home made chocolate pudding which was rich and very flavorful. Â Nice selection of imported beer as well. The only negative part to this place is the service as it was very slow and inattentive.
"We had a party of four and ordered the usual mix of Spanish tapas. Â Honestly, everything was pretty good, but nothing blew me away. Â The ladies complimented the white sangria. Â The atmosphere seemed pretty bumping for earlier in the evening. Â All told, it was a quality meal, but I don't think I would go back there as i've had better Spanish tapas elsewhere (i.e. Las Ramblas)."
"My friend has been raving about this restaurant for months and I recently went there with her to give it a try. Â Everything here was just DELICIOUS! Â My favorites were the homemade tofu which come with a bunch of little bowls of seasoning and add ons, and the pork and kimchee dip soba. Â The tofu was silky and fresh, reminding me of the one from En Japanese Brassiere. Â My only complaint is that the portion was tiny and I could have eaten 10 orders of this. Â The soba noodle was perfectly al dente and had a nice mild buckwheat flavor. Â The presentation of the noodle on a bamboo plate and the pork and kimchee broth in a burning clay pot was absolutely special. Â Keeping the soba noodle separate from the broth and only dipping small strands of noodle into the soup also kept my noodles nice and firm. Â I just loved the entire ceremony of eating this dish. Â  Just writing this review makes me want another bowl of this noodle!"
Yummy burger. Wings are sweet and very spicy! Heard the chicken and waffles are awesome but only available for brunch. Drinks: Bramble was good. Hemingway daquari is okay. Opt for the Singapore sling. Best of the three drinks we tried.
"testo is a pretty good italian restaurant tucked into east williamsburg (tip: CASH ONLY). it's probably not worth venturing out of your neighborhood elsewhere in brooklyn to go to (certainly not if you live in manhattan), unless your main goal is a cheap dinner: in that case, this is the bianca (cheap italian place in noho) of brooklyn. testo offers very cheap food. pasta dishes start at $8, so yes, it is possible to have a bill in single digits. really testo should be classified as a one dollar sign ($) price rating on yelp - not sure why it got $$. if you come, try to make a reservation, as the restaurant is pretty small and can get crowded. i've tried the tagliatelle con agnello (tagliatelle with lamb shank ragu) and spaghetti alla carbonara, both of which were good, but not excellent. the portions are not too big, not too small - enough. the bread, however, was probably the best part: it was lightly toasted pita bread with olive oil, salt, pepper, and fresh, un-pitted olives. i also ordered a bottle of prosecco (around $30), which was pretty standard. all in all, testo is a good, neighborhood-y italian place if you live nearby."
"People say it's pretentious. Â That could have something to do with with being a very busy French restaurant in Manhattan. Â Compared to other places that fit that description, and are less busy, it's Â unpretentious. Â I've never been disappointed by an item from here, except the archaeological pizza-foccacia-chive item at the bakery, which tastes as if it were dug out of the ruins of the Coliseum. Any red meat item is a safe bet."
"This is my to-go-restaurant for authentic Peruvian ceviche. Try the Cebiche Mixto, it's the best I've had in the city. This dish alone deserve the five star! Okay, let me be realistic, and break it down to pros and cons: Pros: 1) The Cebiche Mixto. Try it! 2) It's a popular birthday celebration spot, you will hear birthday songs every 10 minutes! I had happened to me. 3) I like the interior design, very morden. Cons: 1) The front door is very small despite the fact that the restaurant inside is HUGE, two floors. It might be hard for the first timers to fine. But once you've been there, no problem for the second time. Â  2) The servers might be slow. Especially during dinner busy hours. It might take a while to get your food. Anyway, please understand that I have to give it a five-star of their Ceviche Mixto! Although there might be cons and this restaurant is really worth to try."
"You wanna table? Â FIGHT! Â *ding* But the effort is worth it. Â Fresh cheeses, meats, and tasty other bits. Â Have some Asti to sweeten your 'buds while your eyes feast on the fresh items in the market. The fish joint ain't bad either, but it is what is is: fish. Â  There's also standing room and swift waiters breaking plates all over the place. Â Fun stuff."
"You walk into the restaurant and the decor is gorgeous and the bathrooms are immaculate. That being said this was the most underwhelming Thai food I've ever had. Â First issue was that the food was cold. That's probably one of the most important things restaurants need to worry about during service, and they failed. Also, the steamed veggie plate we got was pathetic. The pumpkin curry was flavorful, but again it was cold so not that enjoyable. The servers were nice, but again very slow. Odd because it wasn't that busy of a night. Highlight: Thai iced tea. Can't say I'll go back again."
"Omg, Amazing. Definitely lives up to the hype. I love the red sauce bc i love spicy food, and lemme tell u... it's SPICY! And usually other people's spicy is ""mild"" for me."
"Sometimes when I see an old manhattan institution like the successful Caracas open up a resto in Williamsburg it's like planting a flag in the ground and saying yes, we approve! Of course these guys have been around for a while, but it's the first time I've really had a chance to stop in. What do we find on the menu, the ""freelancer"" shot. Â While I'm technically a freelancer, my friends joke that you can't be a freelancer unless you're broke, and there for I must be a ""consultant"". Â Still I have to order the freelancer shot anyway, and a tecate to wash it down. Â  Food wise it's Tilapia & Jardinia Arepas which are as expected totally out of this world. Â The food is just off the chain. Â  And by the time we finished our drinks, we were off the chain too!"
"Got here at 8am sharp to have breakfast with a friend on a Saturday morning. I ordered the penny egg sandwich with chicken apple sausage in an English muffin. Very tasty and filling! This place filled up fast even though we came super early. My friend had the salmon florentine which looked really good as well. This place is cute for brunch/breakfast. Lines can get long, so best to come bright and early."
"This was quite an experience. Since we were a party of 7, which by the way I wouldnt recommend based on the sq footage of the space, we were able to try most of the menu. Unfortunately, we didnt get around to the Green Mango Paneer, although I was very much looking forward to it. Also, not trying to harp on the space issue, as many great NYC joints are spatially challenged. However, our group of 7 was awkwardly seated at a table clearly meant for 6. Then, they (perhaps greedily) sat two strangers at our table. Making the already un-feng shui seating arrangement just a smidgen funkier. Oh, well. Order a bottle of wine... I appreciated how the super friendly staff took care to thoroughly explain each dish and the thought behind each ingredient. It reminded me of Top Chef w/o all the annoyingness of everyone on the show! The Zucchini Hummus Pizza was light, simple, and just delicious. As well as the Watermelon Feta Salad w/Mint Sorbet. It is served w/goat cheese feta, which would normally turn me off in an extreme way, but was surprisingly palatable. Pork Buns. Phenomenal. Ditto for the Scallops. I am typically not much of a fan for over complicated, fusiony Asian cuisine, but they folks at Graffiti managed to keep the dishes simple and delicious, using fine ingredients and clever combinations."
"A-dorable. Â Not in the little puppy kind of way, but in the... little owl kind of way. It's small, but feels airy because of the high ceilings. Â The bar seems old and only has about four stools, making it feel intimate and genuine. Â And I should mention, the service is great. Â I got there early and the host, Chris, sat me on this perched area to wait for my date and our table. Â We were able to order and enjoy a bottle of wine, while looking over the little restaurant, getting a birds eye view of everyone's meal! Â Yes, you may think that's creepy, but we knew what we wanted to order before we sat down! And now for the good stuff: the meal. Â For one, the wine list is varied, although not overwhelmingly extensive (you know those intimidating books). Â We had an affordable and delicious Sangiovese, which paired nicely with my date's steak. Â I opted for the Halibut which has inspired me to make some sort of corn salad with pesto. Â Seriously, delicious. Â I wish we were hungrier because there were some appetizers that looked amazing. Â  I wanted to go here for a long time and am happy to report, expectations: met."
"I'm not sure if this place lives up to the hype. I've been here 3 times, just to make sure, and every time I wasn't impressed. they're good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't deserve the reviews it has. 1st, expect to wait. there's usually a line at the counter, and another line where you have to give your ticket to a guy who takes your taco deep fried quesadilla was alright. steak is a bit dry, and chicken is just chicken. but the tortilla and the ingredients that go into this are pretty damn good. i heard they serve cactus here too, maybe ill try one day."
"Ate too much and felt like a fat pig walking out of this place, but I left wondering why it took me over a year to come back to this place after the awesome meal I had the first time. Â  We ordered too much and we ate too much. Â Between the three of us we had two appetizers - the raw yellowtail which was probably the weakest dish out of the meal, the crispy frito misto which ranks up there as one of the best I've ever had and will likely serve as the gold standard in my head. Â This was followed by three pasta dishes - black farfalle, taglioni, and the spaghetti - which I honestly have to say is one of the best versions of this humble dish that I have ever had. Â (I am really gushing here) Â Followed by one entree - fennel dusted black cod, which was neither here nor there. Â Followed by two desserts - warm banana bread and the coconut panna cotta. Â  The food was superb and the sommelier recommended a great wine, but I do have to ding this place one star. Â Why the F do you have to use these giant plates when you are trying to squeeze in so many diners into a cramped space and tiny tables? Â Hey management - think about the fact that you are asking your patrons to juggle dishes at the table or have the food arrive at a different cadence versus what they would otherwise want. Â I get that you want to have great presentation and all that, but seriously the food is so f'n good that you can put it on a paper plate and it won't make a difference. Â  The wait staff was absolutely phenomenal. Â  And by the way - don't even think about ordering the il bandito cocktail. Â Just don't. Â It's undrinkable."
"The toast with grilled salmon was great, but everything else was really expensive."
"Quite the opposite experience compared to other yelpers. Setting was extremely laid back (timing perhaps?), and all interactions went smooth. My partner in crime & I showed up 30 mins prior to our reserved time & we were accommodated. No fuss as mentioned in other reviews. The chef/owner even knew my name without looking. We ordered, with a suggestion from the counter person, opened our bottle of wine & waited in anticipation. I loved everything. Antipasta had no chance of survival & was quickly devoured. My P.I.C and I then shared 3 entrees. All delish. I thank the chef/owner & she thanked me back. Saying it's a pleasure to have nice people. Idk what the hell others have done to agitate this woman but she was delightful to us, as was the staff. I'm coming back without a doubt."
"Got here a little before 10am, but the server kindly let us in anyway. He was courteous and helpful, and my friend and I ended up choosing to share the Burekas, which were puff pastries with feta & olives. The sides were good; I really enjoyed the labneh cheese (kind of like sour cream, with a pool of olive oil in the middle) and the salad, which tasted very fresh. I liked the poached eggs and the home fries, but I felt like the brunch was mostly cold. The bureka pastry wasn't that warm ... o_o Service was good, though, and although I didn't leave feeling full, I DID share the meal with my friend. I definitely would've been full if I had eaten it by myself (: We also received a $5 off of brunch for our next visit. Sweet!"
"The restaurant itself is chic but casual, and offers a relaxing ambiance. Great to go with friends over a fun meal! The bar is actually communal-ish, so you many elbow neighbors here and there. If you want more privacy, try to sit at the table. Lunch's 3-course menu option ($25 ish for appetizer, entree, dessert) is a good value if you want dessert, too..it's like going a la carte, ordering 2 dishes and getting dessert free (price wise). Don't leave until you try the signature pork puns with Hoisin sauce and cucumbers..thats what you gotta get. A simple and old recipe yet it's very consistent in texture and taste here..the pork is always melt-in-your-mouth WOW!"
Best burger in NYC. The best burger there costs 9.75 before taxes and the meat is the best ever.
"With over 1,000 yelp positive reviews, Prosperity Dumpling is definitely one of Chinatown's hidden gems. At noon time on Sunday, to my surprise, I hardly had to wait and secured one of 5 bar stool seats. Many people came in and out for takeout. I ordered $2 boiled chives and pork dumplings (#8) and $1 sesame pancake (#14). Delicious, simple, and valuable meal delivered at an incredible speed! Be sure to use some sriracha spicy sauce, soy sauce, or vinegar before you dig into your dumplings! Live long and prosper, Prosperity!"
"I love this place. I've been here for dinner, twice and brunch, twice and all four times were devine. Great, hearty, tasty meals with seasonal flavors. Great wait staff. Amazing cocktails. And a moody decor. A quintessential Brooklyn restaurant!"
"My boyfriend and I decided to come here on a whim because it was close by and I've never been to a Lebanese restaurant before. We were seated right away but we both felt awkward since everyone was wearing business casual or formal clothes while we entered in jeans. I'm not sure whether it was because we felt out of place or if it was because of the interior design, but the place just didn't feel cozy or inviting. The place had dim lighting that was white instead of yellow, which may have been why the atmosphere felt more cold. Although the ambience wasn't the best, the restaurant still deserves 4 stars for its great food. Their hummus is wonderfully creamy with a little olive oil drizzled on top and the pita bread arrives at the table like little puffed balloons. I thought the pita was a little more on the dry side, but that problem was solved with the hummus and olive oil. I had the braised lamb shank sandwich with fried eggplant, labne, and mixed nuts on the side. I was surprised to see nuts by the sandwich but I love mixed nuts so I'm not even going to complain! The lamb was so tender and flavorful while the labne added a different texture and tartness to the sandwich. The sandwich tends to fall apart and the juices end up in the bun or on your fingers but that's when you lick your fingers and resort to using a fork and knife. I got to try my boyfriend's lamb burger and holy moly it Â was so juicy and perfectly medium done that we ended up switching our dishes and eating each other's halves. At the end, I still made him leave me a little of my own sandwich because I obviously couldn't just neglect it! The food here is great but I really wish I had enjoyed the atmosphere just as much. It's also a little more on the expensive side but pretty worth it."
so this is a great run of the mill brunch spot in the village. prices are reasonable. oj is fresh squeezed. ambiance is mellow. i prefer hashbrowns but when places will make their homefries crispy-- i can deal. also the pancakes were excellent! it looked like a short wait for the outside terrace (great weather) but no wait inside with AC! the menu has a Mediterranean flair to it -- i think lunch here would be divine.
HUMMUS! I haven't tried much from this local shop but the hummus is amazing. I try hummus everywhere I go and I continue to come back here to get hummus. It's amazing and better yet it comes with hot pita...enough that I get it for a full meal and for only $6! Only four stars because I'd love to be able to sit down though that'd probably raise prices so I guess i can live without it
"Around Forest Hills there are a fair amount of places you can go to if you are in the mood for a quiet and relaxed evening, Jack & Nellie's is one of those places. The last time we went there was just for drinks but in previous occasions we had their food. Their brunch menu is pretty good too. Although they don't have a full bar they have a good variety of beer and wines. The place is small and cozy, the crowed is probably more mature than other places in the area. Service has always been good."
"Awesome beer selection and what little food we had (the truffle fries) was great as well! Would definitely come back if I'm in this area...speaking of the area, it's kind of oddly situated in a part of the LES that feels relatively abandoned. Once inside though, One Mile House is quite welcoming and fairly large. AMBIANCE: casual setting, but still retains a bit of class. This is not your standard everyday pub. I do remember a TV in the back area where we were seated (along with some obnoxious Boston fans watching the game), but this still didn't strike me as a place where bros go to slam Miller Lite and scream at men wearing tight pants and tossing an irregular shaped ball around. DRINKS: this is the main reason we came. We met my fiancee's little sister and her boyfriend for drinks while he was in town. Apparently the boyfriend is big craft beer person (as are we), so we opted for One Mile House based on the reviews. It did not disappoint. Awesome selection, and they don't give you any attitude about samples to taste before you commit. FOOD: we had the truffle fries to munch on, and damn were they good. The truffle oil helps of course, but even this small sampling of their food has convinced me that I would definitely go for their dinner menu next time. SERVICE: our server was pleasant and attentive without being too overbearing. She had no problem letting us taste samples before ordering a pint. PRICES: I don't recall what the prices were for the dinner menu, but for the drinks and the order of fries, they were reasonable enough. Would come back!"
"3.5 stars We were a party of 4 on a Sunday afternoon at 230 and the place was bustling and quite hectic. There were a good number of people waiting for a table and at the bar with very little room to stand without getting into someone's way. I get that this place is super popular but even with a reservation, we had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. While waiting, there was a table seated in the nook of the entrance by the bar area and I could see that they were flustered trying to wave down their waiter to put in their order. When we finally got seated, we all had a marvelous time as we were in great company and the food was pretty darn good. We each started with a cocktail - bloody mary, oyster bloody mary and the balthazar buck! The oyster bloody mary had a nice kick though does get a little briney as you drink more of it and the buck was pretty good if you're a fan of tequila. The scrambled eggs in puff pastry was flavorful and offered a nice contrast in texture and the poached eggs in red wine sauce was uniquely divine. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the menu options here! PS-Def make sure you check out the bakery next door! It's a small shop but you'll find so many great treats! The cannelle and banana donuts are so yum-worthy and of course, the almond croissants *yum yum*!"
"If I could choose the way to die, I would probably opt for a heart attack after the pulled pork sandwich and the sweet potato fries at this place. I have been blessed by living across the street of this cozy, unpretentious restaurant that features very good food, kind management and fine art hanging on the walls. One star less because it's only cash."
"Just wanted to add my two cents since everything that needed to be said has been said, but this is hands down the best late night food if you have an appetite. Combo platter over rice with the pita bread and plenty of white sauce (the hot sauce is daring). Notes: go after 8pm, it's on the southwest corner (there are carts all around that look the same)"
"The first time I ate here, it was for Sunday dinner--spaghetti with meatballs, broccoli rabe and a few other sides. The second time, I had a polenta dish. Both were very tasty. The food and service are great; it's just a little on the pricey side. Oh, and it is often crawling with families with small children (think loud kids, aloof parents, and strollers in a tiny place)."
"corner bistro is great. Â The burger is messy, so you always eat it faster than you'd planned. Â More than anything, though, it is delicious. Â Great size, good patty. Â It is not my favorite burger in the city like many others have said. Â But there are no problems with it. Â It's a perfectly done, no-frills burger. Â I think the best element is the perfectly done bacon. Â You've got to love the environment in this place. Â It's loud and crowded, yet very personal. Â The service is ornery in a good way. Â The waiter doesnt look at you or acknowledge you, but he is listening, and he'll bring you what you want. Â The line is never as bad as it looks."
"Simply mouthwatering italian food with the perfect combination of grandma's homemade food and modern day zest and flavor. I came here with a girlfriend on my lunch break as I work across the street and have often seen this place bustling during dinner time with a cool crowd and even better looking food. The decor/ambiance is very ""tavern"" like but not like your typical irish bar tavern, more like a classy tavern where you expect people to be drinking wine and playing chess .. or something. We were sat quickly for lunch and immediately greeted by a pleasant and very helpful waiter. My friend opted to order the beet and goat cheese ravioli and I went with the pappardelle with lamb bolognese, mint, and ricotta. We also ordered a side of broccoli with toasted garlic and lemon. Just writing the menu items out is pretty much making my mouth water. First the bread came out. It was pretty much the best bread I've ever had. SImilar to a crostini, it was topped with some mixture of spices and tomato. The pastas were both AMAZING. my pappardelle was so tender and covered with just the right amount of mouthwatering lamb bolognese. My friend's beet ravioli was topped with goat cheese perfectly -- not too much to overpower the entire ravioli but just enough flavor. Even the side of broccoli was perfect. It wasn't the traditional broccoli one sees ( as in the stuff you see in chicken with broccoli ... ) My friend and I both cleaned up our entire plates and I very rarely can do that, especially with heavy meals like pasta. We both enjoyed our food so much we decided that we NEEDED to try some dessert as well. We chose the upside down fig cake to share and we were not disappointed. I'm normally not a fig fan but this cake changed my whole opinion on figs. The cake part was moist and at the same time had this chewy texture. It was topped with figs that were deliciously covered in sugars and other amazing dessert sauces. The entire meal was just awesome. I am definitely coming back very very soon!!"
Great cheap noodles. Will go back soon....
"Pizza here is good - but over-rated and over priced. Â Fortunately I am in Brooklyn - still the land of Pizza and then some. Â No waiting at L&B, PeterPizza, Pizza Park or Ciccio's....to name a few. Grandpa would never believe what passes for pizza today...He left too soon, and his Pizzeria on MacDougal in Greenwich Village - is just a memory and his legacy will forever be in our hearts..."
"Very cool grocery store with unique products. I really like the foccacias that they have to order, and some of the more interesting meats like wild boar sausages. It can get pricey here though."
"I want to give Gila's more of a shot, but so far I'm content with it. Having had take-out three times here, it's been pretty hit or miss, but definitely leaning more towards hit. The chicken shawarma sandwich has been delicious both times I've had it, but incredibly messy once to the point of it feeling like holding a wet sponge. However, when it was good it was GOOD. High quality shawarma that doesn't look like or taste like it's a thoughtful blend of stray pets is hard to come by in this city, and Gila's does have my vote for the top 3. Â  The Suzanne's Shnitzel had received very positive reviews from people Â who have tried it. The falafel sandwich was tasty but far from the best I've had, in the texture department; it just felt a lot more loose and gooey than it should be . I understand it's unfair to base a restaurant review off of take-out alone, Â as even the best food does lose something in translation. I think considering that, Gila's was good but I will make it a point to have lunch on premises and compare. The rugelach are authentically delicious, albeit pretty pricey for what you get. I do like their coffee, the superb friendly service, and the fact that during a blizzard they were one of the few places open so I didn't have to go hungry during an overnight shift at the hospital. Again, Gila's has enough of my attention to warrant trying their other dishes, but in-house. I'm really looking forward to trying the Israeli Couscous and the Bombalamand burger. Even though I make couscous dishes at home here and there, it looked pretty awesome when I stopped in to pick up my order on the last visit."
This place sounds amazing. Empanadas ranging from breakfast to desserts. I didn't try much so I'll probably update my review. This 3 star rating is just for the veggie empanada and the mushroom one. The mushroom is plain (not worth it). The veggie is pretty awesome. Their empandas are baked or fried or whatever else they can do. Takes a while to make but that only means it's fresh. Small place though.
"What's not to love? The $12 happy hour special comes with either beer (selection of 8 beers on tap, local breweries and eclectic varieties) or wine with half a dozen oysters. We ate at the bar and got to meet the awesome owner, Shane, who was able to explain the menu and was super knowledgeable! It also didn't hurt that he was giving everyone at the bar free beer tastings too. Shane told us that the menu changes daily, based on what fresh and local ingredients he gets that day! How awesome is that? The crab cake is amazing and the scallops dish was also one of my faves. Prices so reasonable and portions are just right. Everything is shareable, so bring friends and your appetite. The complimentary whiskey bread is as good as they say!"
"Amazing brunch option in Park Slope. Â My boyfriend and I walked over from our 'hood and the wait was around 30 minutes when we got there at about 2pm. Â The wait was definitely worth it given the time and how hungry we were. Â I was between the burekas and the potato pancake. Â When I asked our waiter what he recommended, he immediately said the potato pancake with two eggs over medium -- done. Â Except I ordered my eggs scrambled. Â My boyfriend ordered their chicken sandwich and both of us were very happy with our choices. Â As other reviewers have mentioned, the labneh is delicious and a perfect complement to the eggs and potato pancake. Â This, and my freshly squeezed orange mimosa made for a great brunch. Â So much so that I might have to revisit next weekend. :)"
"Have to say I was really disappointed here. Â T.H.P.N. has been on my ""To Try"" list forever, and I came in with high expectations. Â With so many stellar reviews, I can only assume it has gone downhill recently. Â I had the hand-pulled noodles with beef. Â The noodles themselves were indeed excellent. Â And from where I sat I could see the chef pulling my noodles in the kitchen, which was entertaining. Â But the meat was basically inedible. Â Every bite was just pure gristle. Â The broth wasn't bad, but not nearly what I was expecting for a place so uber-hyped. Â  As other recent reviews have commented, it seems the four-star Yelp status has gone to their heads. Â Not sure if they're trying to squeak out more profits by using poor quality ingredients, of if they've just grown a bit lazy. Â Ahh well, on to the competition... Lam Zhou, here I come!"
"a friend and i came here for dinner during the brief period of time when they were celebrating their anniversary by accepting reservations. obviously we were singlemindedly pursuing the burger, but the next time i go back i'll most likely order several non burger menu items and a side of the haystack fries, which were delicious. if you're like me and you hate blue cheese, i'd steer clear of the burger, since roquefort cheese is the only thing on it, and the taste is very overpowering. their deviled eggs are amazing, and i highly recommend the burrata starter. also loved the ramp champ, but it might have been seasonal."
Husband loved the duck burger. But that's cheating. My crabcake Benedict did not have a lot of crab. Glorified diner.
"5 stars. They deserved it. Wait staff is always delivering consistently perfect service in the midst of a packed house. Yes this place is rarely empty. It's probably because of their perfect egg sandwich, Americanos, and house burger. The burger bears perfection with beet & egg atop a solid patty of mince. I have dreams about it. That earthy, savory flavor profile is blasted over the top with a grilled pineapple that completed the masterpiece. The rest of the menu has something for everyone. Get there!"
"Paprika, you are my Manhattan version of Brucie, Noodle Pudding, and Fragole put together. Â Affordable. Â Cute. Â Homemade pastas. Â Good wine list. Â I truly do consider Paprika to be among the best Italian places in Manhattan. Â If you want your scene and have a penchant for overrated pasta, go to Osteria Morini. Â But if you want pasta that is honestly better without the frills, Paprika is your place. I had a veal ragu pasta that was a daily special. Â The pasta was absolutely delicious and definitely had the whole ""homemade"" taste to it. Â And veal ragu? Â Well what's not to love? Â It reminded me a lot of the ragu that I would get at Fragole. Â Mmmm. Â The bistecca or steak or whatever was on the menu (I forgot) was also very delicious. Â  I will definitely return here when I'm looking for an Italian place in the East Village."
"Frankly, I am torn between if I should give this a three or four stars. The food here is fantastic -- great value for rustic Italian fare. But the service is rude. My advice is to (a) make sure you have a seat before you order (b) get out of the way, don't block the aisle (c) avoid lunch time. It's a charming little cafe, just avoid the crowd."
delicate and subtle tastiness.
Cheap and good viet food near west village! Good place to meet up with friends for a chill night! Both pho and vermicelli are tasty!
The fries are SO AWESOME and so are this sauces. Â It is a little small but the staff really know how to get the line moving. Â Great for late nights
"I think this place is good for its signature dishes: the dumplings and the steak and eggs. Â Those two dishes are much better than other offerings on the menu. I would give those two dishes 5 stars. Â The dumplings are non-doughy and tasty, the steak was cooked perfectly and I liked the kimchee rice. Â However the duck was a wee bit chewy (but tasty) with a weird bitter greens side dish, and the kimchee appetizer was rather bland (if that's possible with kimchee). I think this place has a bit of a narrow range. I went here a few years ago and recall being more impressed. Â Still, its a sweet little spot and what they do well, they do well."
"I don't care about cocktail culture, and the difference between a bourbon doesn't particularly matter to me. We had some of the fried pork meatballs and duck something. The entrees seemed better, on other people's tables, and I am more comfortable with the prices at lunchtime. Overpriced? I guess not for the neighborhood."
"I love Calle Ocho! Unlimited Sangria for brunch! They have about 7 different pitchers of sangria available (red and white) and you just go up and pick out what you want! You must have food at your table when you are drinking the sangria so i would say to eat slowly! You have to make reservations before hand because this place gets so crowded! Also, everyone at your table must be present! So make sure no one is late! Overall, their food was okay, but i really came here for the sangria!"
"This place is a little odd and they do not do a good job of explaining how things work. The staff is poorly trained, VERY poorly trained. They are young, inexperienced, and clueless. This may be an ok spot for NYU students on a budget but for adults who are used to paying for good service, pass on this place."
was here for lunch and had the crispy chicken with arugula. i stole some fries from my friends who had the burger. was delicious! nice decor and friendly service. would love to try their dinner one day.
"Great food! Had the sweet potato mash bowl with grilled chicken and the haricot verts and everything was cooked perfectly, and most importantly, tasted just as good."
