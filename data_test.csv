"I came here this past weekend with my boyfriend for his birthday and was BLOWN away. I had made reservations a few weeks in advance and had told the hostess we were celebrating a birthday and they gave us free champagne at the end! Very thoughtful and nice employees. We each started with a cocktail, and man they definitely packed a punch. Very well-crafted. I got the Jasmine Sazerac and he got the Cold War. We got two apps to start, the grilled octopus (so succulent) and the roasted bone marrow (my first time trying it- to die for). Finally, we got the steak special for two (Cote de Boeuf) and let me tell you, that was one of the best damn cuts of steak I've ever had. It came with roasted fingerling potatoes, salad, green peppers, and duck fat mushrooms. I could not get enough! I can't say enough good things about this place. The decor/ambience was very chic, trendy and modern but not overly ""hoity toity"". The food was very high quality, excellent service. 100% recommend this!",1
"Hello FAT, it was good to meet you today after a while and dare I say you taste just fantastic. You were literally dripping from the crispy crust and thank you for giving me a good time eating you. I think the artichoke pie tastes too much like Alfredo sauce and the fat is just too much for me to take in one go. Sicilian pie was good. Haven't tried the Margherita pie yet.",1
"Adorable little spot for a casual meal with friends. I love the feel inside--like a seaside oasis with wooden walls and white and light blue decor. I came here for lunch during the workweek and it wasn't too busy at all. We were seated immediately. The menu is short (which is nice) and mostly American cafÃ© food: sandwiches, salads, etc. I recommend the chicken meatballs (great as salad or sandwich) and the BLT. Service is kind and prompt. Definitely would come again!",1
"The food is just as heavenly as the original Ippudo, but now with less wait, and also a smaller selection of ramen (just 3 types). Wait for 4 people on a Saturday night at 7:30pm was 20 minutes. The interior seems to be a little bit more brightly lit, and the space a little bit more open. (Less fixtures and columns in the middle of the restaurant.) Â I'd say the size is about equivalent to the original location. On this visit, I tried the Karaka-men and the Akamaru Modern, both amazingly rich. Â There were little gobs of fat in the latter ramen broth, which I've never noticed before, but maybe it's because I usually more vigorously swirl my ramen garnishes in. Â Oh well, fat is delicious. Â The chashu was tender, and cooked just right. The Tako Wasabi (raw octopus with wasabi) was super tasty. Â It was a super tiny serving, but did last a while because of how tiny the diced up pieces were. Â A good starting appetizer. Hirata Buns - I tried the Chicken and the Vegetable. Both were delicious. Â The chicken was a hearty size, and had a nice deep-fried coating around it. Â I did enjoy this a little bit more than the vegetable one. Â But overall, I think I may enjoy both of these more than the Pork buns. Â I know, it sounds kinda blasphemous. Â (I prefer the Momofuku pork buns to Ippudo's.) Ippudo is still my favorite restaurant in NYC!",1
"Went here for brunch and had a great time. The price was decent for lobster, I got the roll with bacon, and avocado, I wasnt a fan of the mayo that was mixed in with the lobster, but my brother in law got one with just butter, so i'll try that one next time. You also get unlimited coffee, and one cocktail. All the food looked amazing so I can't wait to go back and try other things!",1
"You know it's a 5 star when: - you bite into chicken liver and go ""oh my god"" - you started thinking about 5 stars by the 2nd course - you hate pasta but you could eat the pasta dish 3 times a day every day - you get a ""pre-dessert"" - you get home and you refuse to brush your teeth because it'll make the flavors go away. - you finally give in to brushing your teeth and notice a bit of food stuck between your teeth... you savor that last delicious mouthful. Okay maybe that went too far, but this was seriously one of the better fine dining meals I've had. Â We did the 5 course tasting menu, and it was perfect, from beginning to end. It started with a polenta soup amuse bouche, followed by a chicken liver pate amuse. Â Both were excellent, especially the pate. Â When has pate ever been a dish worth mentioning in my life until now. Â They brought some great rosemary bread with ricotta cheese to the table as well. Â The first course was a squash salad that was light and tangy. Â The second was a poached cod that was so soft in texture, I had no idea how they could have possibly prepared it this way. Â The third was pasta with mushrooms and broccoli, and like I said above, even though I dislike pasta, I could have eaten this all day. Â Then came the lamb with braised chickpeas. Â The lamb was perfectly seared on the outside and had great color. Â Finally there was a ""pre dessert"" celery ice cream, followed by actual dessert of some sort of pecan pie... that description hardly does it justice though. What's even more amazing is that they are able to do all of this in such a tiny space, with an even tinier kitchen! Â The staff are like sweet southern belles! Â The drinks are delicious! Â The lighting is perfect! Â The atmosphere is cozy! Â The attention is great!! I'm going to stop writing now...",1
My family took me here for my birthday and it was great. The food is amazing Â and the drinks are really good. I had the sweet plantain stuffed with pork drizzled with sour cream. I also had the yuca fries and the sautÃ©ed spinach. Everything was great and very tasty! Will definitely go here again.,1
"When I finally decided to get up on Sunday to get brunch with a friend, I tried to find a place that was good and close by - Yelp delivered me this place so I went. The place is super tiny which is fine but just be warned. Also it's cash only! I got the Eggs Florentine and my friend got the potato pancakes with sausage. The eggs florentine with salmon was good. Nothing too wow like most of the other brunch places I've been to are. The potato pancakes and sausage were pretty good. We also got the quiche. I think my biggest problem here in general is just the fact that everything was really salty. I was chugging water like no other. It wasn't a bad meal overrall but giving it only 3 stars since it's not memorable enough for me to come back because the food was too salty",1
"Place is great , but the food is not that tasty . Personally don't like sesame tofu there. But I enjoyed my friend's accompany.",1
"The best all you can eat brunch. Â Make reservations 2 months in advance though - it's always booked! Â Go here with a visiting friend - it's an impressive place. Â Huge glasses of unlimited sangria. Â The food is solid - good Latin American food, and those rolls - SO FAB. This is my new place. Â Only problem is it's so busy you can't just stop in whenever you want.",1
"When I feel overwhelmed at times, I like to wake up early, have a simple Roman breakfast here, read a newspaper or a book and stay for lunch. Â I've been to Maialino countless numbers of times. Â It is a great place to calm my nerves. Â The service and the food are both flawless. Â I've seen Danny Meyer here and he has come up to me to say Bon Appetite! Â  Breakfast favorites: Eggs Amatriciana - I want a jar of that sauce! Olive Oil Muffin Pork Sausage Lunch Favorites: Spaghettini alle Vongole Bombolottie all'Amaticiana I am in love with this place and this has become my usual spot!",1
"Yes, yes and more yes. Â Best ramen I've ever had. Â Yes. Â  The portions are large, but so are the prices. Â Fifteen dollars for a ramen soup? Â And then an addition $4 for additional pork belly? Â I mean, that's fine, because obviously I'm going to order it despite the cost because...well...it's pork belly. Â Now I'm rambling. And drooling. Service was fantastic and the food was amazing. Â Can I say anything that hasn't been said in nearly three thousand reviews? Â No? Â Fine, then I'll stop.",1
I came here for dinner and I really like the atmosphere of this place. It's dark and they played good music. It's a great place for a date night. We had the paella and this fish dish. The paella was flavorful and had a good amount of seafood. The fish had the right batter and cooked thoroughly making it tender on the inside and the sauce was also flavorful.,1
"This is a cozy little fish market and restaurant. Â The seating consists of a line of tables pressed up against each other in the line by the wall. Â There is also bar seating and a standing counter by the store front. When I arrived, there were 2 servers. Â They were welcoming and helpful. Â They seemed enthusiastic about serving their customers, which is always a plus. I came for some fresh calamari and chips but they were out of calamari, so i opted for the fish and chips. Â The fish and chips were crisp and the tartar sauce was nice and acidic+tangy. Â The only gripe I had was, it was very salty. Â I suspect part of the saltiness was from the seasoning from the fries lying below the fish. Â Other than that I enjoyed the meal and would probably come back if I have a chance to try some of the oysters.",1
"They only take reservations for 4 people or more, so definitely come here with a big group to avoid any wait time. We ordered Sukiyaki and Shabu-Shabu. I was a bigger fan of the Sukiyaki because of the sauce and thought that the Shabu-Shabu was a bit too plain - but still very good. We ordered beef, chicken and shrimp - the dishes come with noodles, vegetables, mushrooms and rice so it can definitely be pretty filling. We each only paid $36 with taxes and tip included.",1
Gnocchi was outrageous. Would definitely go again,1
"I went to Tartine on a Sunday for brunch with 4 other friends (including Valerie S. who wrote a review already). It's a VERY tiny place, as expected in the west village, so we had to wait outside in line about 30 mins to get our party of 5 seats.I bet if we were less people (ie a couple) it would have been quicker. Â We liked the idea of this place since it looked cute and was BYOB - score! The food was pretty good - they have a pre-fixe menu for Â brunch about $15, which comes with your choice of caffeine (tea/coffee), OJ, and an entree. I had a sandwich that I requested to make vegetarian which was nice of them to do. Â  For dessert, my friends ordered a ton! Â They had an almond crossiant, hazelnut meringue cake and a big chocolate macaron, Â a la mode. Â We were all amazed at how large the macaron was. It's definitely an adorable little place to go on a date for brunch or with girlfriends :)",1
"Yum! Loved the mac and cheese here. It is absolutely fabulous. The fries were also great and of course, loved the pickle selection. My favorites were the spicy pickles and the green beans. The red beets weren't bad either. The only thing that was disappointing here was the shrimp and grits, and it wasn't even that bad. The grits were great but the shrimp was a bit tough/over-cooked. Â Warning--the shrimp come with their heads!",1
"In full disclosure, I had a few drinks before dining here. Despite that, the mixed drink was rather strong - definitely in a good way - and the bartender even checked back with me to make sure that I liked it. She recommended the pulled pork, which is smoked in house. Â It is a dryer version of what I expect from pulled pork, but, wow, it was good. Â I would have never expected such a tasty sandwich from a place like this. I don't go to the seaport that often, but I might head out a little more now that I know about this place!",1
"Price of the dumpling is pretty cheap. Â I ordered the pork dumpling with nappa cabbage which is just OK. Â The sesame pancake is a must have, Â Crust is warm. Â My mouth is in sesame heaven after first bite. Â  They use a lot of oil to try the dumplings. Â I will try to avoid that if you don't like your food oily.",1
"I was in town for a vacation and happened to be downtown. Being from the Midwest where everyone loves Steak n Shake, I decided to go to the Shake Shack. It did not disappoint. I went with the Shack Burger and it was delicious. I have always heard the lines are horrible, we did not wait too long at all, and the service was extremely friendly. I will definitely be back everytime I am in NYC!",1
"Just ran out to get lunch. Finished a classic grilled cheese with tomato and tater tots at my desk. So happy I made time to step outside today, b/c this meal was a treat. The sandwich was just cheesy enough w/o being over the top and the tots were crispy, not soggy. Definitely going back when the weather warms to enjoy a milkshake in the outdoor Atrium area.",1
"Dinner for 2, friday Age dashi tofu Udonsuki Tempura a roll of some sort All delicious. Udonsuki is meant to be shared, full as I was, I didn't suffer finishing it. Â Piping hot, will steam your clothes, and dominate the table if you're at a 2top. Age dashi tofu had an initial crunch that's so elusive, not a chewy blanket face down in the sauce. Tempura, bright and crisp, great flavor, clean oil. Service Gracious and unhurrying. Between the undonsuki tableside and the timing of delicate, fried dishes arriving at their peak, you can feel the level of attention. Spare and well divided space that balances openness and privacy and intimacy. Â This does not read as well from the front/entry as it does from being seated at the tables.",1
"My vegetarian friend ate pork here. And liked it. Maybe I should have researched that they didn't have any great vegetarian options, but at least it says something about the food! Minca is a small restaurant, but very charming. I sat at the bar/kitchen area with a friend last time and enjoyed talking to the chef while he prepared the food in front of us. Probably some of the best ramen I've ever had in my life. At times the broth could be a little on the salty side, but otherwise very good all around!",1
"I hate seafood-- can't do it, wont do it, forever a ""land"" options kinda girl. Being from the 'land' side of the menu I highly appreciate this place not only being good enough but rivaling some pretty dope steak houses... Everything tastes fresh and the options are plenty with generous portions. This place is a must to visit for sea & land peeps alike!",1
"In a neighborhood where there aren't a bunch of new and exciting restaurants, East Wick has set up shop in between East Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn.Â The restaurant itself is simply designed, but filled with grand, custom-made wooden benches by a local artist. And since it's located on the corner, during the day, the natural light cheerfully floods in from the wrap-around windows.Â  I visited for brunch, and at a more than affordable $14, you get your entree, coffee or tea, and a brunch cocktail. I ordered their Green Omelette (spinach, chives, feta cheese,Â with roasted potatoes, market greens). The food was delicious. The greens were perfectly dressed with a wonderfully sweet vinaigrette, and the potatoes had a nice crispness to the skin and tender on the inside. The omelette was generous in size and the ingredients were liberally filled inside the eggs, making this a healthy and substantial meal.",1
"This place is always packed, even on a Tuesday night. Â I ended up sitting at the bar. Â The service was prompt but just too crowded for me. Â The food was really good and so were the drinks. Â  This is a cash only place.",1
"Great place for family style! Party of 5, 2 app and 2 entree were just enough for us. Service was just ok. Calamari Fritti - Â This dish was good. Big portion with good amount of meat. Mussels - With white sauce. This was not bad, the sauce taste great Baked Ziti Bolognese - This dish was finished pretty fast! Ziti was cooked perfectly! Chicken Marsala - This was the least favorite. The chicken was kindof dry and just soso. Wouldn't order this again next time. The first three dishes we ordered were very good except for the last. Will be back for more family style. Make reservations before you come so you don't have to wait! Came on a monday night and it seemed pretty busy and packed on the first floor (they do have a basement with more seating).",1
The wait is ridiculous but worth it for the food. Definitely do the tasting because its totally worth it for the cost and its absolutely delicious. Actually sat next right next to Sofia Coppola during the second half of my dinner. Fun fun fun place to be.,1
"Hole-in-the-wall. This is on a hidden, dirty, and malodorous little side street in Chinatown and from the outside, it's shady at best. Â Yes, the tables are about to collapse, the chairs are mismatched and probably picked up from a flea market, and the floor has never been mopped since the day they opened. Â This is one of those places where it's best not to acknowledge the state of the dining area or the likely state of the kitchen. Â Overall, I've had better dining experiences in Flushing compared to Chinatown (in terms of authenticity) but I was craving knife cut noodles and Flushing was more effort than I was willing to put forth on this day. Knife cut noodles with duck (dao xiao mian) - The noodles were the perfect texture - thick and chewy. Â However, the broth was bland and left little to be desired. Â I tend to like my knife cut noodles in a spicier and more robust broth since the noodles are so doughy. Â The duck was also dry and lacked flavour. Hand pulled noodles with beef and tendon (la main) - I had the regular noodles (not the wide ones) and thought they were boggy and overcooked. Â The tendon, on the other hand, was way undercooked and actually difficult to chew. Â The broth, once again, was light but bland. Â This is not one of the broths where I slurp down to the last drop. This is definitely a place where you come for the noodles themselves and not the broth or accompaniments. Â I'm giving it 4 stars despite my lackluster description above because the texture of the knife cut noodles was spot on and also because I admire businesses who try to carry on the tradition of making noodles the old fashioned way. Â At $5 to $6 per person for a bowel of noodles, how can one possibly go wrong?",1
"Although the food here is relatively cheap, the quality leaves much to be desired. When we first saw the burgers cooking in the kitchen, I was salivating because of how good and juicy they looked. However, after actually eating it, I was severely disappointed as the burger was incredibly under-seasoned. I rarely ever put salt in my food, so it's not a good thing that I had to add a good amount to my burger here. Beside that, the burger was flopped on a generic bun, with generic lettuce and tomatoes. Really nothing special. Fries were also very unimpressive and just not flavorful. I guess this place is only worth coming to when you have the drunchies, because that's when everything tastes good. I am genuinely confused as to why this place has high ratings - maybe I just got a bad cook that day?",1
"While browsing the NYT, I stumbled upon the review for Tuome which painted a picture of an accountant raised by traditional Chinese parents, who decided to open up his own restaurant after working at Eleven Madison Park. I love stories like these of 8-5 workers who colored inside the lines and then decided to pursue their passion anyways, regardless of the instability, insecurity, and unknown it might give. With a little juggling, we managed to score an 8pm reservation at Tuome. The restaurant facade is how the article describes it, brick walls, but with a little flair. The lighting was dim enough to set a romantic mood, and each table was set with small jars of lavender, tres chic. Amuse bouche was light and a nice slow introduction, (papaya salad). We started with the oxtail spring roll appetizer, and while the essence of bone marrow was not obvious to me, I preferred it that way. Instead the flavors were more in line with the beef itself. The wrapper was fried lightly, without the overpowering oil that encompasses most spring rolls. Of course, we had to try to Pig Out, there really was no other option. I was however surprised with how delicious it was. Each little piece of pork belly was fried with a crispy top and soft and juicy undersurface. I've had my fair share of pork belly, but I've never had pork belly like this. Â Surprisingly, I enjoyed the noodles just as much. Each bowl was a large serving of thick, al dente noodles covered in an ode to peanut sauce. We also ordered an obligatory vegetable dish (corn and curry with kaffir lime), which was just as perfectly seasoned as everything else, although it was slightly heavy with the creaminess, but I'm sure some people like it that way. We were extremely full and satisfied. Based on the other reviews, I knew I was going to get a great meal. I will say though that the food had more Southeast Asian flavors than say Chinese flavors. Go into it with an empty belly and you wil be rewarded. What to say yes to: - Early Reservations - Casual but classy attire - Pig Out",1
"This is a neighborhood gem and if I only lived in Chelsea, I could imagine spending many a Sunday afternoon here. The cafe is housed in this adorable red-brick little abode that looks like quite the anomaly on an otherwise barren strip of 9th Ave Chelsea. While the restaurant has all the standard fare you'd expect of a French place, they're notable for their huge selection of crepes - both sweet and savory. Due to my enormous stomach prowess, I can usually compromise and get a savory crepe for brunch, and a sweet crepe for dessert. I know it's probably hard to mess up a Nutella banana crepe as a generous rule, but Le Grainne heightens it to new levels with extremely generous, cavity-inducing quantities of Nutella. Here's the problem with this place: everything on the menu looks awesome, and my eyes inevitably wander to my neighbor's table and I think, ""Damn I should have ordered that beef bourguignon""...""Mmmm.. pain du chocolat""...""Well maybe I do have room in my stomach for french onion soup."" They also have quite the selection of coffee / chocolate drinks, and they serve them in TUREENS. Literally, it's like drinking a bowl of hot chocolate. Amazing. Only downsides? Spotty service (but hey, we're emulating the European lifestyle, right?). Also the kitchen is not separated from the seating area, and as a result the smell of grease gets trapped in my hair and clothes, which is a real downer.",1
"So yummy! The ingredients in the banh mi are soooo fresh and never disappointing! The cilantro really makes it for me in a banh mi and the cilantro is sure kicking every time I take another bite! If you choose to get the spicy option the peppers are always fresh and also pretty spicy! But don't be a whimp ! The service is quick and they make sure to pack everything in individual paper bags when you make multiple orders. I also like how employees are working in an orderly assembly line to make things extra quick and smooth. In addition to their fresh food, there are refrigerated drinks in their self-serve fridges and also an array of packed personal baked Vietnamese pastries to the side. This place does not disappoint and I would not know why anybody else would go anywhere else for banh mi. The prices start at $4.50 and end around $6. Also, the restaurant is actually fused with a jewelry store (in the front) so if you choose to sit on one of the stools- I mean I guess it wouldn't hurt to admire some jade jewelry during your banh mi.",1
"If you don't secure a reservation for brunch, you'll understandably be relegate to restaurant's back corner. Food is good, but not good enough to ever come back, which is common thing to say in New York: ""Yeah, it was good--I mean I'll never go back, but yeah it was solid.""",1
So far tried a few different things in Eataly. Most impressed by the seafood section. The razor clams special was a phenomenal experience! Other fish dishes came out good. even the salad there the flavors are spectacular. oysters was so so though.... Another time I tried the vegetarian section. the risotto was one of the best I have ever tried. Other time I bought a loaf of bread from there. Was very expensive but the best bread I have eaten in USA!,1
"I had my first experience with soup dumplings here... at Joe's Shanghai! I immediately fell in love with the soft, juicy texture... I always thought dumplings were soft, but I never knew they could melt in your mouth! Technique to eating the dumplings, is key, though. One of my friends bit right in and was in a lot of pain when all of the hot soup squired into his mouth. They may feel just warm on the outside, but beware, they're piping hot on the inside! We tried both the pork and the crab meat with pork. While I'm usually a big fan of crab, I preferred the plain pork. I prefer simplicity of flavor when enjoying texture food (I enjoy soup dumplings more for texture than flavor). But you should still try both and decide for yourself. Everyone is different and our table of five was pretty divided over which dumplings were better. We had a few other dishes that night that weren't very memorable. I ended up ordering more soup dumplings towards the end because they just stood out so much to me. I think in the future I'll probably go as a mid afternoon snack and just get the soup dumplings and enjoy another restaurant in the area for dinner!",1
"This place is a little hidden gem that I came upon, from the outside its not someplace you would think had the best damn hot dog I've ever had! It looks like a old regular biker bar, small menu, in which you order from the counter. We took a seat in the huge backyard and waiting for what so many raved about...the piled pork and sweet potato fries. When the food came out and it first hit me mouth...oh my god delicious! The pulled pork you have to add your own BBQ sauce, which is fine with me, I'm a dipper. It was very flavorful! One of the best I've had. The sweet potato fries came with a sauce, mayo based which was awesome. But...the BEST PART of my entire lunch was the HOTDOG! Yeah a hotdog, who would have ever thought a dog can taste so good. It's wrapped in a perfect crispy back with melted cheese, and oh so juicy inside! The staff was also very friendly and I will be coming back! Especially for the DIRTY DOG!",1
"For a hole-in-the-wall take-away food eatery, they are the best! Â Their falafel and shawarma are always fresh and hot. Made to order!!! Â For under $5 you eat healthy and fast. Â I love substituting the LTO with Taboulli. Â Makes the sandwich so much more tastier! Â Let's not forget about their amazingly super spicy hot sauce. Â You better like spicyyyyyy or else you'll be on fire for a few hours. Â And they sell it in bottles for the home. Â The counter guys are always super friendly, and the cooks are really fast. Job well done boys, keep it up! Thanks a mil.",1
"I came here late to sit in the garden after a night of drinking with some friends and had a quick bite. The first think you notice in the garden is the 4 gigantic lampshades covering up some trees sans leaves. The pattern on them is multicolored, almost tie-dye like, and sets the mood by splashing soft hints of color throughout the garden. We were going to order a cheap bottle of wine, but our waiter would not let us order it! Turns out he had seen a bottle of it turn out sour earlier that evening. He suggested a different bottle which was similarly priced and we loved it. We ordered a tray of prosciutto with focaccia, the pumpkin cognac cheesecake, and the caramel custard, each excellent. I know it is a semi-exposed garden and all, but seeing a small mouse run under the lonely tables in the corner really ruined the experience for me. The other members of my party did not feel the same way.",1
"I've never had a bad meal. Â The dining room is lovely, but the tavern is great too. Â I've enjoyed the hanger steak, the sea bass, the lamb, and a couple of chicken dishes. Â It is pricely, but totally worth it. Â If you ever have the opportunity to hit them during resturant week...DO IT!",1
"We entered and were pleasantly approached by a nice guy. Â Waited a few moments before being seated. Â  Ordered seaweed salad- yum and good value. Â  Ordered several items including the sushi rolls, wild salmon special, several hand rolls over and over. Â Ultimately, everything Tasted fresh and good.... We left after spending over $100 and were still starving... Very sad.",1
"I was with a group of friends and we had just spent several hours at RK Bridal. We were all starving and on the verge of crankiness when we realized Go Go Curry was just a block away!! Within 10 or so minutes, we all had a steaming plate of Pork Katsu and curry in front of us. I regret to say I had mine devoured within minimal time. The counter guy was super nice, the food was delicious and filling (and cheap!), and it will definitely be my go-to lunch place if in the area!! I'm a fan. I heart Japanese style curry!",1
"Although the cashier's attitude is awful and the food is below delicious, I've learned to appreciate Great NY Noodletown more when it's 3AM and I'm in desperate need of food. Noodletown is a great Chinatown stable with many locals favoring the joint. Their wontons, bbq items, and noodle soup items are the most popular. I highly recommend the bbq pork over rice! By the way, its prices are steals!",1
"It was a quiet, emplty little place, probably deserves a 3.5 for its ambience, and I really want to give a 4 for the food too, but sorry I wasn't that impressed at all. Â  Despite being warned by one my venezuelan friends that this place is not as good as my other venezuelan favorite in the city, I decided to give it a try for my own judgement. It was the perfect spot for late night quick causual bite after the movies. And the sangria was pretty good too, but I feel that their guacamole can do a lot better. Also, I love fish and I love arrepas, but i did not like their fish arrepas. If I go back again, it will be to try things that i haven't tried in their menu and to give it another chance.",1
"I make better katsu curry at home, but for a joint in the dirty 30's (aka the ""Garment District"") this is not half-bad. It's cheap, stays open until late, and it's fast. Sometimes I only have 15 minutes for lunch, which is enough to walk 3 blocks, place the order, wait for it to come out, inhale it, and then walk back to the office. Not bad. Then again, I feel slightly sick afterwards. Note: the chicken they give you is very thin; meanwhile, the breading is thick. So you end up with an unfavorable ratio of protein to carbs. But for $6-7 bucks, I've had worse.",1
"This is a great neighborhood bar and I'm so mad I just recently discovered it given I live so close. There are a ton of positives about this bar - really good bar food with nice variety (burgers, Jameson wings, fries, lobster mac - all great), decent prices and drink specials, friendly service, lots of TVs, two floors with plenty of seating, nice crowd (unlike some more trendy sports bars in the area). This is quickly becoming our go-to bar. You likely won't stumble upon this place given it's location on 28th but it is definitely worth coming by to grab some food/drinks to watch a game. If football (soccer) is your thing, this place is definitely for you.",1
"Umm, kind of overrated for a noodle shop. Â I mean the soup is flavorful but I can eat the same at my grandma's house minus the annoying shouting and ridiculous line at the front. Â This is definitely not a place for people suffering with anxiety. Â Cramped front room filled with annoyed and hungry people who have been waiting over an hour to eat. Â Just a note for next time, do not bring a hyperactive preschooler. Â lol. The restaurant is a dim chamber, if you are lucky to have a large group you can be seated at the booths. Â The food arrived quickly and was piping hot. Â Good noodles but not sure if it's worth all the trouble. Â But definitely go just to say you've been there once.",1
"bought a living social deal here cuz i'm on this new healthy thing.. haha. but i got a steak sandwich and it was really good though i dont really know how healthy it is. huge portions, fresh ingredients, and great prices (Except for the smoothies which were $6 each but theyre super good). service was great too",1
"Excellent coffee, sandwiches, and bread. You'll pay a pretty penny here, but stick to lunch/brunch and coffee and you won't regret it. Service is generally friendly and prompt. Here are my favorite dishes: (1) Insalata di rucola con parmigiano: Easily the best arugula salad I've ever had, featuring large leaves of rucola (an Italian variety of arugula), sheet-like slices of parmesan, and two fresh tomato slices. The generous serving of fresh-cut parmesan (more moist than dry) nicely complements the rucola's spicy and bitter flavor. I've searched high and low and have found no equal. (2) Non ti scordar di me (""don't forget me"" -- apparently a famous song): An unforgettable panini featuring speck, pate, and brie on a perfectly toasted baguette with a crispy exterior and chewy interior. (3) Cervino: A delicious panini comprised of venison filet, goat, and brie also served on a perfect baguette. Â  (4) Sferrata di salute & minestra del lavorante (two vegetable soups): Admittedly, I cannot distinguish these two mixed vegetable soups from memory (I think the former is pureed while the latter is not), but these lightly-seasoned veggie soups allow the fresh vegetables and broth do the work. (5) Complimentary bread: Essentially sliced and toasted pieces of the same magical baguette used for the sandwiches, the bread is covered in herbed olive oil and really whets the appetite. Skip dinner here, as the offerings are average and rather expensive (i.e., no correlation between price and tastiness). An added plus, if you're into this: this place can be fun for people watching (people on the UES are entertaining in numerous ways; plus you might see a celebrity or two, or so I've been told).",1
Best take out food in Chinatown.,1
"Man it's such a popular place!!! Got reservation only on 6pm. When I arrived, there were only two table served, but 1 hour after, man....no table is empty! And I've noticed there are people went in try to enjoy some food and then walked out cos no seat available. so,Do the reservation first! Hakata Tonton Hot Pot is a must try - Next time I'm definitely gonna put Ramen in it - this time the Garlic Fried Rice made my stomach too full for any Ramen... Yellowtail Sashimi is nice with many thin onions. Pork Tonsoku and Cucumber is a good choice in the summer, and it's good for the skin :) No wonder you have to order in advance.",1
This place is very nice. Came here for lunch between my daughters dance classes. The ambiance is very nice. Now for the food. Ordered Pad Thai /w beef and my wife had one of the soups. I am not a big Thai food person but the Pad Thai was good..the only thing is the beef was very dry and chewy.. My wife had the dumpling soup which she enjoyed greatly... The price was and food was very good an would definitely recommend.,1
"Well where do I start....maybe with the fact the store has been SHUT DOWN by I assume the Department of Health. Here I was, hungry and craving the Mediterranean classic, falafel sandwich which is quite delicious from here. Much to my surprise, I walked up to the door and witnessed the sign for myself which must have been placed recently because a local seemed surprised to see the sign as well. The falafel and chicken sandwich was/is/will be again hopefully again excellent. Who can beat that just baked/fluffy pita. Can't wait until things are resolved here, gotta admit that I will be back.",1
"Pretty good food. Not too many choices for lunch special but a lot of options on the regular menu and appetizers. Place is small but clean and comfortable. Ordered the shabu shabu lunch special with the beef and it comes with salad, rice and ice cream plus a complimentary plate of veggies and noodles.",1
"Not a fan of ramen at all but decided to check this place out since ramen is the cool thing to eat if you're white. Got there at 3pm on Friday and had no issues finding a seat. Service was fast and friendly. Got the Akamaru Modern ramen ($14) with extra meat ($4) and added the lunch combo which comes with a small salad and chicken rice bowl with a meat topping ($4) The ramen was pretty good and had a great presentation. The extra meat gives you two more slices of pork i believe. The noodles were a bit slippery and hard to get a grasp with the plastic chopsticks though. The salad was small but really tasty. The chicken rice bowl was pretty good. With the sauces in top it tastes like a burger king whopper which was a nice surprise. Â I would have liked to have seen more meat in it. The rice wasn't that sticky and a bit hard to eat. Overall the meal was pretty delicious but for a total cost of $24 for one person, its definitely on the steep side. Food wise, I think I prefer this over Totto Ramen but you pay an extra $5 for a bowl.",1
"No reservations and long waits. Is it worth it? Â My answer is yes! Greeted by a pleasant hostess who unfortunately has the difficult task of telling us that it will be an hour wait. She added that there's no guarantee that we will be seated cause the kitchen closes at 4 pm. Hmmm... My hubby was about to walk and I was able to convince him to wait. Â  Fortunately less than an hour later out name was called. Thanks to those who decided not to wait. Waiting pays people. :) The place is small but there were additional seating at the back. Interesting set up. Every casual and expect to be sharing elbow space with your neighbors. Got the chicken and waffles while hubby got the chicken box with biscuit and home fries. Surprisingly the food took almost 30 minutes. But when it came we were not disappointed. The chicken was crispy and moist. The waffle seems to be maker of whole wheat. The combo was awesome. My husbands biscuit was buttery with a crusty outing. For dessert we had their donuts. They claim to be the best in NYC. I don't necessarily agree :(. They were huge and tasty, but nothing to rave about. I will come back for the chicken and waffles. Not for the donuts. :)",1
"Ippudo makes me so happy. It's my favorite place to eat in all of New York. Lunch is worth it. Dinner is not that worth it. I always lunch combo the Akamaru modern + Roast pork over rice. I always effin have to effin order the effin pork buns. These three items are enough to share between me and a girlfriend. P.S. don't get any toppings because it's not worth it. Come with only one other person; seating is faster for a party of two. Come right when the place opens at 11am. Don't come on a weekend dinner, but if you do, leave your negative reviews whining about how long you waited far from this place. I honestly could care less about service if the food is this damn good, but JUST SO YOU ALL KNOW: their service is top notch. I NEVER have to ask for my water to be refilled, it just. somehow. always. is. refilled. like Jesus feeding the 5,000. There's a Japanese guy with silver hair who works here and he's hella courteous and professional and I honestly just love him and I love Ippudo because they're not at all about cheesy smiles and careless smalltalk. It's all about business: they get you in, serve you the best damn meal of your life, then get you out. All without a fuss. Damn, I love Ippudo.",1
"+ 5 for the ramen & the buns - 3 for the customer service = 2 Honestly. I understand being firm about needing a complete party to be seated, but to (a) act like we were a bother to even tell you how many of us there were (b) be completely off with your es",1
"Did I walk in to a jewelry or sandwich shop? Oh wait... I guess it's both! It's a funny combination. I can't comment on the jewelry because I didn't buy any but the Banh Mi sandwiches are awesome! Don't be intimidated going in here if you aren't Vietnamese. They seem to speak pretty decent English and it doesn't seem sketchy at all. I think this place has gotten lots of publicity and I'm sure the owners love it. I got the spicy Banh Mi Ga which is the chicken and it was extremely tasty and absolutely delicious. I am so excited to come back here for another sandwich. Some of the other menu options seem interesting (or rather strange), like the Sardines. Maybe I'll even try one of the other menu items at some point.",1
"I ended up here by accident because the people I was with were not from the city and didn't want to go to the LES for beer. The rooftop isn't really impressive as you can't really see anything while standing bunched up against people since it's so massively crowded. HOWEVER, there is major eye candy here so as I pointed out several to my friend. Â  The rest of the group were hungry so here was an opportunity to try some food and ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. The pork shoulder didn't live up to my expectations as it was a bit bland. Â However, Â I like carbs and the olive oil mash potatoes were very good. Overall, the experience was ok since it didn't leave much of an impression to me",1
"This review will feature just the following few bullet/list points: 1. The dumplings are, in my opinion, superior to Vanessa's (lighter skin). 2. I bought a bag of like 50 for $9 about 1.5 months ago. 3. I've been eating that bag consistently since that time, and they remain delicious to this day. 4. Once this bag is finally depleted, I will be returning to purchase a new one.",1
"Maybe it's just me, but all i remember about this place is the wine being o-k and my dish being some SMALL OVERPRICED type of pastry-meaty-creamy thing. Oh and I was not rip roaring drunk or in a state of blacking out - it just wasn't that memorable. It was ok. But then again everything in NYC is... if it's not we export it to _______ . I don't think i'll be leaving the comfort of the numbered streets to head down here again. Unless of course the night repeats itself and the restaurant we wanted to go to *COUGH Freemans is booked solid and we stumble upon this place because too many damn people are eating at all the other places.",1
"This is the first time I can say I have eaten a street cart that puts it to 53rd and 6th. Â I didn't think I'd ever see a Halal cart that consistently pushes out better platters than them. Â However walking home one day recently from worked I noticed the old cart on 30th ave. beside El Rey has been replaced by King of Falafel! They are usually handed out their uniquely shaped falafel pieces to street-goers in a delicious attempt to lure you into their amazing platters. Â This place serves up the most amazing platter ever, they don't just dish out a crappy salad mix to your plate, they add a real delicious salad along with your falafel, chicken, or beef. They aren't open anywhere as late as El Rey, so, make sure to get your fix pretty early, otherwise you're going to be stuck with the #1 taco truck Â However this place is one of those ultimate places where vegetarians and meat eaters can always agree to get an amazing giant platter of Halal. Best Halal street cart in NYC as far as I know.",1
"My review will be a collection of my three dinners here since summer, including last evening. I lived in Thailand for two years and love Thai food, culture, and art. Last night my laarb moo was cool, not hot. I was disappointed with the food not being hot or warm. The flavor was great as was the texture. The Pak Boong Fai Deng was also warm. However, I ordered the food spicy and it did not have any chilies. The flavor tasted off too. One surprise was the garlic was minced instead of smashed and in big chunks like in Thailand. I sent this back to add the chilies. The soups were delicious, especially the Tom Ka Gai. We ordered a vegetarian version that was delicious. It is possible my winter meal was an off night. I will have to come back to see. In the summer I have eaten outside and the food was splendid. I've eaten so many of the items here including the whole fish, curries, soups, veggies, and desserts. The garden is quite lovely and relaxing. I think this is the best Thai food in NYC. I notice the patrons at the restaurant are 75% Asian with the majority speaking Thai. This is a great sign for me. If you like good Thai food that will make dishes you usually cannot find in the States this is a good option.",1
"Queens Comfort brings exactly what the title offers to the table, comfort food. Â The chicken and waffles were comparable to some of the best I've had and that includes Amy Ruth's, and Rosco's. Â They have a little spice kick to it, which I do enjoy, but felt a little TOO heavy on the artery clogging side. Â The Disco Tots are amazing. Â What hipster establishment isn't complete without the soon to be extinct Mexican Coke? Â For the food, easily a 4 star in Queens. The dining room has a large communal central table with smaller tables encompassing it. Â There is another square table in the corner to fit a couple parties near the entrance and there is also bar seating. Â  Service, once you are able to be served, is top notch. Â Waitress is very helpful and accommodating. Â Most everyone here is young and enthusiastic to please you with their food. Â However, this is where youth is a shortcoming. Queens Comfort is open mostly in the afternoon, then closes and reopens again in the evening. Â Sunday it is open only for brunch. Â If you have the unfortunate chance of coming here for Sunday brunch, god help you. Â Queens Comfort isn't the place to go to on a whim. Â Premeditated planning is required and especially on Sundays. Â Yes there is often a line and no the ""estimated"" time they give you is no where near the actual time. Â To avoid this, come as early as possible, and I'm talking about close to opening time. It was a balmy October Sunday when I had experienced this Queens Comfort. Â The grips of winter had not yet squeezed the life out of the city. Â 2:00pm, my friends who were visiting and I decided to give it a try unaware of the ride we would be put through. Â ""Party of 4, probably like a 30 minute wait."" Â This was not a problem and it would have left plenty of time for them to make their 5:00 appointment at ground zero. Â 15 minutes pass and I peak inside to assess the situation. Â The bar seating was empty, so I asked the host if it would be ok if we just sat at the bar and ordered. Â As if the available seating manifested upon him like a bright idea, he stated that he would need to ask others before us if they wanted it. Â I thought we should have been rewarded for pointing it out, but at least it'll make the line go faster. Â Total of 30 minutes have elapsed, so I check on the progress. Â With a clueless expression he surveys the room, ""Maybe like 30 minutes?"" Â So 30 minutes later, with the line shorter due to the now available bar seating, it's going to be another 30 minutes? Â Upon further inspection of the dining area, there were plenty of tables with guests who have finished just chatting away or even worst typing up stuff on their phones. Â Essentially they were holding up the seats that would have been available to the other people waiting. Â I understand you want to keep hospitality by not ""nudging"" them away, but you're forcing others to wait for no reason. Â Finally after a total of 1.25 hours (that's 1 hour and 15 minutes in case the guy who can't tell time is reading) to a near empty room. Â Essentially being the very last group to be allowed to eat. Â We were the privates of the army, the rookies of the team, the dog begging at the table; only after everyone else gets their fill are we allowed to pick the scraps. Â Not surprisingly some items were sold out, but thankfully not the best. We had all agreed the food was great, the service once served was excellent, but the wait was not worth the trouble. Â If the wait was truly 30 minutes as first advertised, it would have been a flawless brunch. Â However since we were baited with a carrot on a stick to linger around for over an hour, it made the sweet taste of syrup just a little bit sour. Â I do not advise going on Sunday afternoon unless you feel lucky. Â I will have to try another time to really gauge the wait time. Â We might have been unfortunate, or maybe an hour is a really good wait time.",1
"The smell was intoxicating the first time I walked by this cart. Â But I told myself, ""no, you're going to be good tonight and save money by cooking dinner."" Â And so I did. But the next week, the memory of that aroma randomly came back to me on my subway ride home. Â The Broadway stop couldn't come any sooner, and right when I got off that train, I was a woman on a mission. Â It was freezing cold, but I told myself that no matter how long the line was, I would go home with a King of Falafel meal. Sadly, I was salivating for a shawarma, but they had already ran out of lamb. Â I decided on a chicken gyro with a side of rice (which ended up being a whole pie tin full of rice!) with both white sauce and hot sauce on the gyro. Â Once I got into my apartment, I couldn't control myself from inhaling the food. Â Both the gyro and the rice were deliciously savory, and it only cost $7. Â  Even if you know what you want, don't forget to read the menu signs, since they provide some laughs. Â Gotta love the ""yahhhhh baby""s in their menu descriptions.",1
"this is my favorite place to eat in NYC. every time I come here, the food is so good, that I can't leave anything on my plate. The place is always filled and has a trendy, but not pretentious vibe. In the warm weather, they open up the doors for outdoor seating and it makes for a beautiful night. They don't take reservations for 2 so there is typically a short wait. We usually put our name down and have a drink at the bar and wait to be seated. Best eats at Barbuto (their menu changes, this may not be available): buratta appetizer & the gnocchi",1
Where do I begin? This place was just plain awesome! The finger foods were amazing I had the ginger wings and dragon fries. DJ rocked out with classic hip hop and R&B songs. The Lychee martinis were amazing as well. Definitely will be back!,1
"Came here recently with a group of friends. I have been to Pio Pio a few times, have gotten takeout a few times, etc. I am not a big fan of the place but people seem to really like it. Their interior at this location is very nice. And their chicken is good. and their sweet plantains are great. We usually order the entree for three, but we generally ask to swap the bland plantains for the sweet ones, we ask for no sausages on the fries and we can instead for more sweet plantains. I personally don't think the chicken is that great. I think the Rotisserie chicken at Fairway is even better than this place. =:0",1
"We recently ate at Sotto 13 with a large group of folks at a bachelor party. Â The meal was served 'family style' with one choice of 2 options for a main course. Â The food was good albeit very small- one meatball, a spoonful of calamari, a small piece of thin crust pizza, and either a mushroom lasagna or a chicken dish for the main course (both small). Â I don't mind smaller portions at high prices, especially when dining in NYC, but nothing about this meal was high end except for the price. Â $75 for just the food. I could have had a similar food experience at a pizza joint for a quarter of the price. Â But it wasn't all bad- the food was pretty good, the ambiance was nice. Â The wait staff were friendly but couldn't get a drink order correct the entire night. Â Maybe going in a smaller group is the way to go.",1
Neither rain nor snow nor gloom of night stays this place from delivering awesomeness.,1
"LOVE! Came here yesterday (aka lazy Sunday afternoon, aka perfect day for some yummy pizza) and were not disappointed! This place reminded me and my husband of the pizzerias in Italy that we had visited this past may. Â We had a 1/2 liter of Chardonnay (which was quite tasty and got us pretty drunk against all odds) and each ordered an individual pizza - my husband got the Diavolo (with olives and hot sopressatta) and i got the hot Italian sausage pizza. Both were delicious and quite large. Â The outdoor seating area was a definite plus, cool but encased in glass so u don't get eaten alive by mosquitoes. All in all this place rocked and totally took us back a few months to Fierenze!",1
Best part of this restaurant was the happy hour M-F 1pm-8pm.. White sangria was super good and cheap! Arepas was good! Guacamole was standard... Really good atmosphere..it's like being in the tropical island without being there kinda atmosphere! Lol I would most certainly come back in the future..,1
"Oh tasty morsels of Spanish goodness, you help win still more points for Mr. Batali and his culinary talents! Seriously, I've been wanting to check out Casa Mono for years, what the heck was I waiting for! My friend and I met up for a late afternoon lunch (or early dinner) on a weekend. We each enjoyed a glass of wine and 4 delicious tapas. We started with the foie gras and the razor clams. Wow, decadent and delightful. Then we had the bone marrow - we were both first timers - this was very rich. Our last dish was the fideos, which is crunchy on top, salty, garlicky, and loaded with perfectly cooked clams on the bottom. I have an itch to visit Spain this year, and this visit to Casa Mono only feeds that fire! Yum yum yum!",1
"Brunch is my favorite at Cookshop. Â  I've tried almost EVERYTHING on their menu, as I live a couple of blocks away from the establishment. Â My favorites are the huervos, the pulled pork sandwich, and the cookshop scramble. Â Cookshop has also restored my faith in excellent bloody marys - so I always get one (or two) during my brunch. Not sure if they have this on their dessert menu - as they're always changing something - but if they do, please try the Banana Sundae. Â Whooooaaa mama - that is SO good. Â So good, you might want to get them to invest in proper sundae spoons so you could scrape up every last bit in the fountain glass they serve it in. I've tried their dinner menu - but wasn't impressed. Â It was ""good"" - but not memorable at.all.",1
I love the breakfast menu. I'm ALWAYS satisfied. Nothing better than a mimosa to nurse my hangover. It's too bad I can't say the same about dinner - hit or miss.,1
"Delicious food, great service and cozy ambience! We loved everything that we ordered - the cheesy bread, the arugula salad and the shrimp stew - with the exception of the gnocchi with lamb ragu, which was just ok. The gnocchi wasn't as light and pillowy as I would like it to be. The cheesy bread was hot, straight out of the oven with a cheesy gooey center but not in a gross, heavy way that trashy American pizza tends to be. The arugula salad was perfectly dressed with buttery butter beans and beets. I could have eten just that for dinner and been perfectly happy. My shrimp stew was velvety and hearty but again, without being overly heavy. It came with delicious garlicky greens. Overall, the meal was very satisfying!",1
"I love this place!! The dinner is great and filling. The only drink I get here is the mojitos, they're possibly the best I've tasted in this area. I've had the churrasco, Ropa vieja, empanadas, mofongo and everything was tasty. Plus, on certain nights there's a live band there and even a guy in the window rolling cigars for patrons. As for brunch, the unlimited drinks make it worth it. Overall it's a bit pricey but worth it for the quality food you will get. Check it out!",1
"Updated Review: Ordered online today and my food was ready to go 10 minutes later for pickup. Ordered the Oxtail special with moros (cuban) rice and tostones(toasted plantains) for $10. Oxtail - pretty good but I was expecting more after all the hype. You definitely get WAY less meat by choosing oxtail as your main since it comes on the bone, which you can have to pick off - a bit labor intensive. I enjoyed my chicken a lot more and would not order Oxtail again. Moros rice - dark rice with black beans - pretty good flavor. Hotsauce goes great with it. Tostones - was not included with my order, I was given Maduros(regular fried plantains) instead which kinda sucks. They're good but completely different from what I actually wanted. Maybe they didn't have them today... who knows. I dropped a star from my original score since the oxtail was underwhelming and my online order was not correct. Original Review: Went in around 2:30 - Oxtail was gone :( Got the following: Chicken meal - $10 - a large plate of rice, beans, and plantains, and a smaller plate for chicken. Got a huge piece of chicken leg.(Got one of the ladies to serve me as the reviews recommend) I was incredibly surprised by how good the chicken was. It was definitely falling off the bone and super juicy with a great crust on the skin. Add some hot sauce and it was awesome. Cuban Sandwich - $7- the guy who makes this is a pro, he was flying these out of his sandwich corner. These are about 9-10 inches in length and made on cuban bread that's been ""panini'd"". Comes with mayo, pickles, salami, pork, mustard, and green sauce. Pretty good tasting sandwich. They take crash or credit. I like it",1
The dumplings are INSANE! Also get the steak/frites + request a side of Aioli! Service is also incredible.,1
"Hangry. We've all been there. For me, it hit while I was walking around Williamsburg on a super hot day. I had just spent 3 bucks on an awful coffee at a cafe to use their wifi, all to find out the wifi didn't work. Burn. I dropped my wifi search and instead, just needed a really great lunch with a best friend to make me feel better. As if by fate, me and her decided to walk towards each other and happened to meet in the middle at Cafe Mogador. We almost missed the sunroom in the back but once we saw it, immediately asked to sit there there for a meal that turned my whole day around. They have great lunch specials but we both couldn't resist the falafel. It came quick and was really great, especially the tahini on the side that I wiped clean. You have your choice of side - I went for a fresh salad and she got some fries. No complaints there! Add on the friendly service and good price, I was hangry no more!",1
"Brunch only review! This is one of my favorite places in Williamsburg to order my fave, eggs benedict. I think the seaoning and preparation is really delicious. I have also had their egg souflee dish Â and croque monsier which were so good! I don't think there is any item which I have disliked to be honest. Coffees', scones and potato's are also fabulous.",1
"Wanted to grub after a concert at the Barclays. Seeing Buffalo Wild Wings crowded, decided to take a stroll. Always wanted to venture in Park Slope since it has a lot of gems. Happen to find this place as nearest and open and popped in. Decor is very nice and it seem like all the patrons were out before/after a night out to enjoy this food. Wanted something light so we ordered a chicken quesadilla with a side of guac and two mojitos. Checked in to get free shot to get the meal started: Quesadilla was delicious!! The sweet plantains add extra flavor and wish it didn't end. Guac was more on the garlicky side for me but still on point. Maybe it was the bartender'a off day or our taste buds were off because drinks were not good at all. Watery and tasteless. We super politely asked to change to margaritas and our server did so with no hesitation (she really made the experience better being so nice). After getting the margaritas, same as before: bland. At that point we gave up on the drinks and ordered the Empanada Platter. Was suggested the Beef and Shrimp and also got Bacalao (codfish) and Steak. They came with these sauces and guac. I loved the Shrimp and accompany sauce the best. Found myself just dipping all four in that one. Will be back to try other dishes and happy hour because drinks could not be THAT bad and to devour way more shrimp empanadas, with extra sauce. A lot of extra sauce.",1
Love this place!! The food is always on point! love the calamari. I ordered the salmon and it was delicious! Can't go wrong with this place. I would definitely come back for dinner. I need to come back here for brunch as well.,1
"Nice Dominican spot located amidst a bunch of auto repair shops. Off the beaten path, with a wonderful interior decor. I ordered the chicken sandwich, but the real winner is their breakfast plate. It is $5 for 2 eggs, potatoes and bacon or sausage. Other traditional Dominican dishes abound, and the house made salsa is fantastic.",1
"I really appreciated the service here. I wish I had gotten our waitresses's name because she was so sweet and attentive. It was one of my first times trying Lebanese style food. My partner had come here the night before and shared with the waitress that he liked it so much he decided to bring me here. She recommended we try the mezzas to get a broader flavor of Lebanese style food. FOOD: Mouhamara- One of my favorite dishes. It came on in little round balls that you can dip the pita in. The dip was a bit crunchy from the walnuts and spicy from the peppers but really deep flavor. We LOVED the warm soft pita bread that came with the meal. They were kind enough to keep on refilling as soon as it became low. It goes well with everything. Brussels Sprouts- This Â is the most unique sauce I've had with brussels sprouts and it works! I felt the brussels sprouts were a bit over charged but still ok. The sauce on top is yogurt mint, walnuts, fig jam, and fresh grapes. Chankleesh- This is like my partner called it jokingly the caprese salad of Lebanon. It was feta, tomato, and onions. I'm not a huge fan of feta so it wasn't my favorite salad but glad I tried. It has a fresh taste to go with the meal. Bone Marrow- There were four large bones cut in half. I am going to describe it for those who might be wondering. It has a jelly like consistency and really rich in flavor fatty almost creamy. It taste great smeared like a spread on crusty bread. This one came with pita and a tabbouleh. It was fun to insert the marrow into the pita pocket and put some tabbouleh. Mekanek- Lamb with pine nuts in a lemon sauce. They look like breakfast sausages. I felt as though the sauce was too vinegary for me. SERVICE: The service was great! She shared up front she could only fit a few dishes at a time but she will have them out as soon as we are able to fit more. She came by several times to see how were were doing. She asked if we were enjoying the food. She asked if we had any questions to help me better understand the food. She gave us a free dessert at the end because she wanted to show appreciation to repeat customers and food lovers.",1
This place had a nice ambiance. Staff was friendly and authentically Greek:) I preferred the small over the entrees. Example: Dakos. Yum.,1
Hell yeah. Totally satisfied with quantity and quality of falafel as well as the other interesting stuff they put in the pita; cheap; has a tolerable environment and fine service.,1
"This is a solid local spot, for local people. There's nothing for you here, so why don't you keep on walking down to Saxon and Parole or The Wren or whatever overpriced Bowery ""locally sourced slow food eatery"" you have in mind. Leave me to my small but solid selection of beer and my reliable menu of Cajun food. And of course the Shaggy cocktail, which is Gosling rum and my favorite Blenheim ginger ale.",1
"Habana Outpost... I've been visiting here a few times during the summer. I enjoy the food.. but Â I really enjoy the Drinks..... It's a cool spot, come with friends, family and just sit outside take in some fresh air.. just a nice relaxed time.. BUT!!!! as of recently it seems ppl view it as a club.. now there are Bouncers at the doors.. and the area gets flooded with motorcycles and the fashion show gets into full effect.. SMH.. I stay away Friday & Saturday nights.. Best time to go for a nice relaxed time is mid day any day... or go during the work week or Sunday nights.",1
"This review is super late. I came here restaurant week 2014 in may for lunch. The restaurant is right above the FDR which gives an amazing view. My friend had the Rabbit pasta (forgot the name) & i had the ribs & sausage (forgot the actual name). In addition, we had side of peppers and fries. The portions are great for a restaurant week deal and food was delicious. Unfortunately, one of the main reasons why i went was because of their infamous dessert, cereal & milk and it was no longer apart of the restaurant week menu. Sadly, i found out upon arrival.",1
"Juni Lunch patrolling *\(^_^)/* You need to go have lunch at JUNI asap!!!!!! I just had one of the best lunches there the other day!!! I don't use ""the best"" all that often, but I am today!!! I came here last November for a four course dinner ($90). Dinner was great, but this business lunch was even better! The place was completely empty, but who cares!!! The three of us ordered the three course lunch which was only $35 each. Don't you just love a lunch course?! You get to feel luxurious having a nice lunch during the week AND you get an unbelievable deal (^_^)",1
"Go for a big bowl of BBQ Pork Wanton Noodle Soup and you won't be disappointed. $8.50 per person with tip, and it tastes straight-up Cantonese. Â Go around the corner for a big Green Tea ice cream cone at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, and your meal is complete!",1
"It's not even funny how serious the corn is. You'll never eat your veggies in the same way again unless they're smothered in cheese, chili powder and lime juice. I don't even want to write much about it, because descriptive words CANNOT do this corn justice. It's the most succulent thing your lips have ever encountered. You take a bite and your teeth just sink into the thick layers of corn. As your come up for air and your nose is covered in white powder like so many Wall St. execs, you'll start to taste each flavor, first with the roasted, buttery corn, then the cheese that is melting off of the teeth marks you just made. and finally the kick of lime accentuates each flavorful morsel. And the fact that you only spent $2 for each ear makes you justify wanting to buy eight more and call it a day. This corn is that piece of food you crave when you're hundreds of miles away from Cafe Habana, lying in bed at night, wondering why you ever left a city capable of turning out such exquisitely delicious and affordable food. No fuss, simple restaurant with a charm all of its own within the trendy Prince St area. If you're hungry, go crazy and get at least two pieces. This is a 10 star establishment all the way. But don't take my word for it--after all, I'm only going off of my melancholy memory of some addictive corn.",1
"I mean, it's been on my must-go list FOREVER and let's be honest, everything that could possibly be said about this place has been so I won't waste your time (or mine). In short, I came (starving) at the perfect time--12am on a Thursday and was able to sit right away. They recommend coming before 8 or after 10 to escape the harrowing crowds that take up the corner of 11th and gren; immediate props for the homey feel of the place, checkered tablecloths and all. I highly recommend the 75 south--it is honestly the perfect summer cocktail with bombay gin, lemon, cava and the magic maker: rhubarb shrub...yep, you try explaining to me what the hell that is--no matter, it goes down like juice and at 12 bucks a pop it's easy to wrack up a hefty bar tab before taking a bite of anything. While I so appreciate the kitchen being open until 2am, things inevitably run out and I was EXTREMELY irked when the burgers ran out as I was in the process of ordering one--something our waitress, though very helpful up until that point could've pointed out as we'd taken our sweet time to order. Grrrrrrrr. Alas, I'll have o go back, and that's honestly alright by me as I still need to taste what is perhaps the biggest Bloomfield draw to this place. The food we did manage to score though hit mostly high notes. The chicken liver on toast was truly fabulous--no it's not incredibly unique especially at gastropubs such as this one where upscale bar food is the main event, but this one rivaled pulino's (the best in my book to date) and was the perfect starter. Also in the small plate realm were the famed devils on horseback (I was truly excited about these babies) and the beets and greens. While the former was delicious (i mean, it's bacon), i was a bit disappointed as they were practically swimming in their own fat...it's not quite sexy to have to shake off the excess oil from these tiny meat lollies. The beets were good, nothing to write home about but it was nice that they came warm as opposed to most beet preparations. To continue, the gnudi, sharing the must-have title with AB's roquefort burger, were divine...and probably one of the richest plates of anything Ive had in years, or maybe, ever. The brown butter, while more-ish was a bit overwhelming. The portion is right for sharing as I don't know if one could (or should) consume every single on of these large pillows of ricotta. Mmmmm. Don't get me wrong, it's utterly sinful (especially when you dip the crunchy bread into the sauce--seriously try this) and worth a try, but lord I think I can still feel this in my stomach (thighs, butt...) days later. We opted for the octopus as well which had a great char to it and was perfectly cooked. It's not as memorable as 'inoteca's version but it was a nice balance to the rich pasta. Lastly, the market greens was a blah side, but a necessary dose of veg among everything else on the table. Don't try to ask for any changes or additions or substitutions though (aka, ""may i please have tomato on the salad?"" ""No."" ""Um, ok."") because you won't get em. All in all, it's definitely a gem and a great people-watching spot and I really do need to go back for that damn burger. But the ridiculously inflated prices, lack of subs, and overall 'we can get away with everything bc we're in ny feel' while fun if you buy into that for a night, has its moments. ...I would love another one of those 75 souths tho...or like 12.",1
"Ouzi....mmmmmm..... Â (only available Friday night to Sunday)...chicken, rice, raisins, spices wrapped in a not-quite puff pastry balloon of goodness. The rest of the food that I had (falafel, salads (labne, beets, chickpeas, feta and dilled potatoes), hummus and babaganough) was all good. Not 'amazingly good' but certainly enjoyable with crispy garden vegetables and freshly baked pita. Service was OK...waitstaff tended to sit and chat a lot when they could have been circulating (refilling water on this 90+ degree day, offering extra napkins, checking to see how things are...just general waiter stuff that for some reason they didn't do that day).",1
"What an extreme difference from my first visit! Â This time the service was nonexistent, the food was inedibly salty, the ambiance was plaid-clad Greek life meets B&T, and worst of all: the sommelier took 5+ tries to identify a full bodied red wine, which was our only single specification. Â How disappointing...",1
"Taste-wise this place is better than Vanessa's dumpling if we must compare, but when you compare this to other dumpling places, it hardly makes the mark. Â Yeah okay the prices are dirt cheap, but quality and taste are sacrificed for price. Â The pork dumplings although seasoning wise was okay, the pork was a little strong in taste. Â Their shrimp dumplings were a joke. Â 10% shrimp and 90% cabbage and bland bland bland. Â Pretty sure it would be more accurate to name them cabbage dumplings. Â Not worth the trip.",1
"This place is fantastic! I have two go to favorites that I alternate. If I feel like ordering something hearty and fulfilling, I would go for the country style pigs feet w/rice and vegetable. Something about the way the pork was prepared has changed my mind about eating pigs feet. Remember to dip the meat into one of their side condiments, the green chili. Now if I want noodles with soup, I'll order the beef stew flat noodle soup. The beef stew and tendons are tender and flavorful. The noodle sits in a thick broth that soaks up all that soupy goodness, I'm just at wow! This place is affordable and quick!",1
"The food here is great. Always get the chicken curry. Inexpensive. Also free water. Every time I'm near I try to grab a bite. Not a lot of seating, so don't go during lunch time.",1
"Taken here by a friend who knows I am an avid fan of Banh Mi... Ordered the Pork Belly Sandwich, loaded it up with Siracha and delved in... First of all, the bread-- I wanted that wonderful ""crunch"" of a banh-mi and instead I am left with this dense, albeit good, chewy French style bread that disqualified this sandwich in my eyes as a true Banh Mi. The flavor is very good, just not the combination I expected; also the price (to be expected in Union Square) was a little high... but no big complaint there. I found the pork belly to be cooked perfectly on the 2 occasions I've had it... just wanted more Daikon and a little more cilantro. The queue is sometimes difficult to navigate, awkwardly ordering at the window and waiting inside stuffed in a 30 square foot area with 10 other people.",1
"Went here for a birthday dinner last week, and it was good! Â We had the flat bread, fried cheese, gnocchi and salad. Â Everything was great - especially the gnocchi, which is really similar to the gnocchi at The Smith (the sister restaurant). I had the burger - really good! Â Great fries too. Â Plus the milk and cookies for dessert were just perfect. Service was great too, and I really want to go back for brunch. Â My one demerit was the table - there were 7 of us and we were smushed around a tiny circle table in the corner. Â It would have been ideal for maybe 5 people, but for 7 it was a little tight.",1
"Fantastic experience at Maialino. Our waiter rocked, I forgot your name (too much wine) but my heart sings you praises! The quality of food here is amazing and the service provided here is gold. The waiters here are very knowledgable; you tell them the type of wine you like they can bring you out several bottles to taste LOVE, and our waiter was not at all bothered about questions we had on the menu she even suggested things which was perfect! The stand out in my meal was the Robiola Cheese it was just heaven and Flourless chocolate cake & buttermilk gelato I am dreaming about =) for my entree my friend and I shared the ravioli and the octopus pasta so delicious! I really cannot wait to come back!",1
"My wife and I have been going to the Double Windsor off and on since it opened, and other than the occasional miss, it delivers every time. Â Good selection of beers at a fair price, decent selection of food at a fair price. Â Comfortable, casual and funky atmosphere. Â Really friendly vibe. Â Great to visit in the afternoon, great in the evening. Â There isn't anything NOT to like. (What's the occasional miss? Â Well, on weekends when there is a street fair, or something is going on in the park, it can be so crowded that service suffers. Â And sometimes the wine/whisky pour isn't what it should be. Â But those misses are rare and unusual...) Yeah, you have to either sit at the bar, or get your ass out of the chair at the table and go to the bar to order. Â And yeah, you have to go to the food window to order food. Â All that exercise keeps you sober. Â Most of the time. Fries are crisp and tasty (and plentiful). Â BLT is one of the better BLTs in Brooklyn. Â The hamburger is up there with the best of them, maybe IS the best of them. The food is just plain damned good. Â And reasonably priced. Lots of beer, lots of choices. Â Lots of whiskies, lots of choices. Nice and cool on a hot day, and nice and warm on a cold day. Go and enjoy the DW yourself. Â You'll never be sorry...",1
"I wish they had a Cornerstone Cafe in my neighborhood. The portions are big and the weekend brunch is reasonably priced. My friend and I came here on a Saturday afternoon and was prepared for a long wait, but surprisingly we were seated in 5 minutes. My friend ordered the baked eggs, which also came with a side of white/wheat toast and a generous portion of home fries. I ordered the steak and eggs and an Americano. There wasn't anything that stood out or was off-putting. I thought that the waiter was very attentive, and I may come back to try some of the other dishes on the menu. I would definitely try this place if you haven't been. But other than that, it is your typical weekend American brunch with good service.",1
"Had gone here in the past & enjoyed the tapas. The first male waiter seemed so out of it, could barely speak, then the second waitress was equally bad. Curt, rude. The tapas were really just okay - the albondigas were like rocks. no taste. patatas bravas were spicy, little flavor. the gambas con ajillo were lots of garlic but blah.",1
"This is a really popular spot, theres ALWAYS a wait for it no matter what time you come unless you are a party of 1 then you will probably get seated right away, the food is consistent and i think their soup base are really good.. my favorite one is the aka and the wasabi... cant go wrong with either one (maybe i like aka a little more) their pork belly buns are good and the samurai ribs are a must try! the meat slids right off the bone. i would skip on the dessert since there are alot of better places around the area but if you are in the area you should definitely check it out",1
"Too popular for its own good. Â Five of us had lunch on a weekday and it was more than packed. The ordering process is confusing. Â You kind of order at the bar then usually pay at the cash register. Â However, it's not clear whether you pay upon ordering or pay when you get the food. Â It's also unclear where you get the food and where you're expected to wait. The food is delicious. Â The Il VIP was amazing, and I don't even like prosciutto. Â The mozzarella sticks are better than most but unclear why. There isn't enough sitting area. Â The wait was overwhelming. Â I'd still go back despite the bad points.",1
"Best time to go is at lunch by yourself. Used to stop by after class for a nice filling meal. In the great Momofuku Noodle vs Ippudo debate I have to side with Ippudo. The broth is richer and the noodles are very close. Momofuku does have better pork buns though. The ones here are still worth getting, but not the best in the neighborhood. The lunch set is sure to fill you up if the noodles don't, and if you're feeling extra gluttonous you can always order an extra serving of noodles. The karaka-men has become my go to and is the standard by which I judge all other ramen. Before they raised their prices this would be a five star review. While I'll still gladly pay now, it's just a little less satisfying than it used to be.",1
"My cousin was coming over to hang out with me so he let me decided on a place and me and him both bookmark this place to try so 1 less to worry about. We took the cab and they drop us right in front of this place. At first I didn't know where to go but I remember reading on yelp that it is in the basement. Some girl waiting for her ride saw us looking for the restaurant so she say yes just go downstaire.I like the way it was design and the place look and feel awesome. There were a whole book just for different types of sake and some of them ran to hundred and thousands. I pick the Saturday special sake which was a good deal for $13 for a small bottle. We all decided to pick 2 dishes each so I pick the eel vinaigrette and the sea urchin with a eggs. Both of them were very disappointed and not even worth it. I also pick the Spicy cod fish roe but it was all salt and believe me, I can eat a lot of salt but this dish I barely could touch it. I order the uni soba which I was excited about but later on they told me that they ran out of this. So I order a few more dishes but nothing was really tasty. The highlight of the night was ordering the black seed cream brulee which was soo dam tasty. I could have eaten another one all by myself. Overall this experience suck, don't get me wrong I like the sake and the evironment but the food just suck. Next time I will just drink.",1
"This is a great, greasy Cuban joint. Too bad it is crammed into the Times Square area. Cleanliness? Fuggedaboutit! Tastiness? You betcha! Seriously, the food is delicious and priced to move (ie. Great Value). I can speak to the Cubano Sandwich and the Roast Chicken. Both are mouthwateringly, devilishly, fantastically yummy. I don't think I'll be eating at the location or going for pickup. Delivery however, please sign me up.",1
I found this place as I was looking for restaurants that used organic ingredients for my sister's bridal shower. I went for dinner once and it was great and I've been to brunch twice for the french toast and the hangover pizza. I will always get the hangover pizza when I go back for brunch. It is that good!. They have wine on tap which is awesome and which also means I have to go back for dinner :),1
"Had a quick lunch with the family. Â The service was quick, the food was tasty and the price was totally affordable. Â Order the lobster dish!",1
"Okay first I have to say, I'm a little bit biased. I HEART you David Chang. Okay not as much as Grant Achatz but you're pretty up there. Who's Brad Pitt? David Chang? Yay! Okay my little disclaimer is done. But the pork belly buns was good. Pork was fatty and delicious. Simple but flavors came through well. The crunchy pork bun was also good. Not as good as the pork belly bun. The beef sandwich had good bread (but it cut up the roof of my mouth alot) and good slaw but it was a little bit lacking. Not as juicy as pork of course but lacked something I can't put my finger on.",1
"Well, hello. Â Another solid place here up on the UES. Â I came here for what I meant to be brunch at 2PM on a Sunday. Â We had the burger, kale salad, home fries and biscuits; all met my expectations. Â They had great beers on tap (including a sour). Â  There is no table service so order at the bar.",1
"This is a foodie place and that's why me and Mrs G spent my birthday here. Â Every dish is an original and is accompanied by quality trimmings (e.g. salt, truffles). Â Very nice cocktails, beer and wine list. Â Tasting menu was tempting and would go try it on a second visit. it would be a 5 star except the BBQ Baked Olde Salt Oysters were drowned by the surrounding flavours and textures. Â Do it better or remove it from the menu. Â Marc, I recommend natural flame and a kick-ass BBQ sauce - you would be surprised how good that combo tastes. We will return when the seasons change. Â It's always a positive statement when the chef sends food to the table and there is no charge - Â we liked that very much. Â Do not expect to save money and don't criticize the restaurant for being expensive - it is - and they give you something for free. To sit at a proper table - make a rez. Â If you want to drop in - get a seat at the bar or common table. Our server was deluxe and knew the menu well.",1
Hmm BYOB with simple and tasty food. We got there right before it opened so we could have a table (there were a lot of us). I don't recommend a big dining party if you decide to eat here because it's very small and hard to get by the chairs and tables. It's delicious and inexpensive and not a bad place to spend an afternoon.,1
"Beyond Sushi is beyond good! The prices are also excellent -- for about 17 bucks, I was able to get the Sweet Tree roll, two individual pieces (Seaweed Piece & Snow Pea), the mint cucumber juice, and the Coffee & Chocolate Coconut Oat Round for dessert. Everything was delicious -- the Sweet Tree roll's blend of avocado and sweet potato was very savory, and the Seaweed Piece had a nice kickl But this place is TINY, so probably not a good idea for groups of more than four.",1
"Great place, no waits, nice ambiance, excellent food for a decent price.",1
"I went last weekend with the rents for my moms bday breakfast at about 945am. We all ordered different items. I had the salmon hash, my dad had an omelette and my mom had the pancakes. All were just average. Honestly, my regular diner is better. The salmon hash was just so-so and the poached eggs slightly overlooked. My dad was not thrilled with his omelette. My mom only ate one pancake. Our bill came to $54 for 3 so for thee non-AM-drinkers, it was on the pricier side since brunch included a mimosa or Bloody Mary. We choose OJ instead which happened to be very good. Unlike other posters, I thought the service was excellent. Although the place is cute, I would not go back.",1
"Over 100 years ago, you wouldn't want to walk through the neighborhood streets known as the Minettas. They were slums, dangerous slums at that, where life was a struggle. Fast forward 100 years and the only struggle at Minetta Tavern is deciding between black label burgers, cote de boeuf and bone-in new york strip. It's a pleasant enough problem to have while dining at this speakeasy-esque locale and former stomping grounds of Hemingway, E.E. Cummings and Eugene O'Neill. After my own long day's journey at work, securing a table on a Wednesday evening seemed feasible. If I had arrived a few minutes past 6:30, a wait would have been required. I even made it before the outdoor bouncer was on duty. So the take-away is that if you don't want to wait, get here early on a non-weekend, non-traditional dining out night. Walk through the red curtains and enter a recreated world of the 1930's, a fusion of bistro and bar by way of Paris and New York. The outside hustle and bustle takes a back seat as you enter a self-contained slice of the good life. So my day dictated the need for beef and bone-in new york strip was ordered along with several sides. Two surprises of the evening were just how delicious pommes anna and champignons poÃªlÃ©s could be. Don't count calories when considering pommes anna-- the more butter, the better in this classic French dish of layered potatoes. The pan fried mushrooms were also increasingly addictive and I rarely have anything positive to say about fungus. Order the bone-in new york strip rare. The crusty, flavorful char contrasts perfectly with the succulent consistency of the beef that was Â cooked with care and eaten in a frenzy. I should have taken more time but literally devoured this slab of beef in record time. Tender is an understatement. And at $56, tender is essentially required. There was room for dessert, even after the carnivore carnival that just transpired. Warm hazelnut crÃ¨pes and an after dinner port was the perfect pairing. The crÃ¨pes were light and flavorful, with a hint of hazelnut frangipan cream that teased me with every bite. Service was impeccable, despite the crowded interior of close set tables. Subjecting one's self to hearing the conversations of others is a small price to pay for food this good. I'd gladly listen to all the troubles of my fellow diners for a chance to re-eat everything listed above.",1
"A good dive bar. Pretty cheap drinks. They only take credit card for more than $15, which is annoying, but the bartender broke my $100 bill because that was the only cash I have, and that was really nice.",1
"Sanford's used to be a diner with basic diner food. They remade themselves into...well an upscale diner. The beer selection is good-to go with their whole 'upscale diner' theme. I got their bistro burger which honestly was just okay. I split the truffle fries with the gf and it was probably the best thing I had. The french onion soup was just-honestly, kind of hard to remember. I don't see the big deal about this place. The food is okay and pricey for what you get and well, if I'm going to pay that much for a burger it better be worth it.",1
"Pies and Thighs - Best fried chicken in Williamsburg hands down. It's cramped and the atmosphere is very ""hipster"" but the food is spot on. Just get the plain old fried Chicken it's to die for. The biscuits are perfect and flakey. The corn bread is moist and oh so good. This place gets BUSY and the line is out the door. As most places with Williamsburg go early and beat the crowd. You will be eating at 6pm but it's worth not having to wait on the street!",1
"There's always a line outside, but it moves fast! Just get the most popular dishes and you Won't get disappointed! Cash only; tips is included in your bill!",1
"Wow, what an amazing meal! We got the marrow, sweetbreads, asparagus w duck, and grilled trout. Even though the items on the menu were familiar classics, every plate was creative, surprising, and fun to eat. Service was great, decor is really nicely done, and cocktails were strong 'n tasty. I can't wait to come back!",1
"Everyone loves this place. I have been a few times. Maybe I am not ordering right, but I don't think it is that great. Â I don't get why everyone loves it so much?",1
"Oh hell yes. Not only did I have one of the best burgers I've ever eaten IN MY LIFE, the chef and server were so nice that we were basically friends at the end of the meal. When my friend suggested this spot, I almost protested because it is three things that I don't love: it's in Williamsburg (so hard to get to from Crown Heights), it's cash-only, and it's BYOB. I am so glad I did not protest. What a gem! What a treat! I had the truffle burger, which was just the most perfectly medium-cooked patty, topped with sauteed portobello slices and drizzled in truffle oil. I almost have truffle fatigue at this point, but the craftsmanship of this burger made this flavor combination seem as fresh as the first time I tried it. Tom the cook and Raphael the server are great people. Raphael was super friendly and was joking around with us within a few minutes, and Tom came out from the kitchen to chat about the restaurant business and the changing neighborhood. We had the best time. Krystal, I'll never doubt you again. You pick all the places we go from now on.",1
I didn't think the fried dumplings from Prosperity Dumpling could be topped. I was wrong. And they are here. And you get 12 for $3 and you can sit comfortably (kind of) and enjoy them. Noodle soups which they are known for are also excellent.,1
"I don't care about the wait, or how crowded it is during happy hour.. I will come here regardless of all this and smash 3 of their lychee martini's for $5 each before heading to the next LES happy hour spot. I love the upbeat vibe here and how i never regret my visit when walking out the door.",1
"Shake Shack NY: Manhattan: Battery Park 7pm Monday 28th July 2014 Four Stars First Time at Shake Shack. Â I have heard the West Coast v East Coast debate between In N out and Shake Shack. To me, they are completely different creatures. Â In n Out is fast food but really, really good fast food. Â Shake shack is a gourmet restaurant with Burgers, Hotdogs, Ice Cream, alcohol, and restaurant prices $13 for my meal. Â I had a Double SmokeShack with Lettuce, Tomatoes, Pickles, Cherry Peppers, Bacon, and Sauce. Â The Bun was fluffy. The Burger was not overcooked. Â The toppings were fresh. Â The Cherry Peppers were spicy and added a great flavor to the burger. Â  The Fries were freshly cooked to Crispy Perfection and then topped with American cheese sauce. Â I like it but wasn't super impressed. Â No real comparison between the two but being from California I would chose In n Out.",1
"very tasty, but kinda overpriced. or maybe I'm just cheap? probably both.",1
"When most people think of South Indian restaurants, they think of pancake-like dosas or uttapams. Not me, I always go for the thali. You see, thalis are the closest thing to getting a home-cooked meal in an Indian restaurant. They are a prix-fixe meal made up of a selection of various dishes. The dishes are served in small bowls -- or katoris -- and are arranged around a huge mound of white basmati rice. How does Samudra's thali rank? Pretty strong. Portions are large, with substantive vegetarian dishes such as palak paneer and chana masala. No watered down soupy curry dishes here. The selection is a mix of Northern and Southern fare. Nothing was too spicy or oily. A full prix-fixe meal for $9; that's good value in my book.",1
"Gotta hand it to the halal guys, I first tried it 6 years ago, up to this day, it's still just as good if not better. Great job on the branding guys, gotta make sure you protect your image from impostors. My new favorite they had this time was the combo wrap, my boyfriend claims it as the best wrap he's ever had. We also tried the BBQ combo, but it wasn't as good. It was kind of weird to have bbq sauce with halal food. Gotta hand it to that white sauce though, makes everything taste delicious.",1
"If this is the best chicken & waffles New York has to offer then we are seriously lacking. I've been here three times and have yet to be impressed by the food. Though I do think the menu has a pretty good selection and the drinks are really tasty, everything I've eaten here has been cold, bland and underwhelming. The chicken to me lacks seasoning and their syrup is really watered down. The mac & cheese is mushy and lacks flavor. I think the best part of my meal each time was the cornbread that they serve before your meal. I do however think that the staff is quite nice, though they can be unprofessional at times. Last time I was here two waitresses were busy yelling across the restaurant at each other for several minutes while I and the other patrons got pretty agitated. I think I'm just about ready to start exploring some other soul food spots around the city and I hope to find something much better.",1
"My girlfriend recommended this place for lunch since we both work in SoHo. She recommended the Octopus and Spinach Noodle plate and it was AMAZING!!! She had the Miso Glaze Salmon and it was sooo good too. Our friend who ate with us, got the Pork Chop sandwich and he was very pleased with his order as well. The Lemon mint tea and Lychee tea were refreshing and our friend's Watermelon cooler was delicious!! (all $2!) We also orderd the Mango Lobster Summer rolls as a starter :D YUM! This little cafe is tucked in a corner and is awfully small but the prices are great for lunch. Under $9 for an entree - unbeatable in SoHo really! This is going to be a regular place for me...next week, I'm trying the Tuna burger or the Steak sandwich...Mmm..Mmm..",1
stopped by today to order the whole chicken for $12.00 for takeout. they gave me 3 containers of green sauce. so nice and juicy.,1
"Bottom line: DELICIOUS BRUNCH!!! Definitely a must try if you're an regular NYC bruncher. + Food - great variety and selection on the menu. I tried the Benedict Johnny and it was amazing! Sunday brunch items come with a complementary cocktail (WOOHOO!) but just know that if you go to brunch before 12pm you can only get juice, as they don't serve alcohol before then. + Service - our waitress was great! Very nice, attentive and genuinely friendly. I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shout out! + Atmosphere - the place itself is pretty big, with a modern but cozy feel. Definitely a warm place to enjoy breakfast.",1
"I am in love with Lao Bei Fang. Â I can make a good love with it. I have tried all those ""4/5 dumplings for a buck"" places in the city or BK. So for the first time I checked their price, which is 4 dumplings for $1.25, I was like ""Oh, a bit pricier"" What a cheapo, I know, but that what I was thinking. Sometimes you get what you pay for, in a good way or bad way. Â But an extra quarter a HUGE difference. Size of dumplings are completely different from those places I've been to. Almost double size, stuffy and meaty, with crispy dough. Â  Best deal compare to quality you can get around the city by far. I just LOVE this place. Who is Lao Bei Fang anyways?",1
"When I worked in Abu Dhabi, there was a little cafe across the street from my office called Ya Zain. They specialized in sandwiches and pizzas made on bread that was baked fresh-to-order. I would pick up two small sandwiches for lunch -- one cheese & tomato and the other cheese & spinach -- and I'd spend about $1.50 for both. I'd tell myself that I was eating some healthy vegetables amid all those carbohydrates. So what's my point? I have two: First it sucks that I can't review Ya Zain because Yelp only exists in a few countries. But Google reviews are everywhere. Why is that? Secondly, the Bedouin Tent reminds me of Ya Zain. It's menu centers around baked-to-order bread. Sure, there are salads and mezze and stuff -- but the real house specialty is the bread. It's fattening, gluten-rich and unhealthy -- but it's damn-satisfying. Try a pizza or a leg-of-lamb sandwich. Or the zataar bread is super traditional and only worth eating on fresh bread like this. The food alone at the Bedouin Tent would get five stars from me, but the service isn't great. My waiter could barely be bothered to take my order. I'll be back for takeout!",1
"This was a delightful brunch. No significant wait with an early reservation and our waiter was good. We ordered the lobster Benny and the Benedict Jane and split them. Â Both were quite tasty. Â They both came with spinach on them which I scraped off. I think the spinach distracts from the deliciousness(is that a word? lol) of the benedict. Â I would order either of these again but next time I would just have them hold the spinach all together. Â  The eggs on the lobster benny were a bit overcooked which was a bit of a disappointment, Â it made the biscuit underneath seem too dry but we still enjoyed the meal. The potatoes were also very good.",1
"CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY. There, did I make myself clear enough? Grab cash before you go in! Do it!! Lots of beers on draft and bottled, so it's a good place for beer lovers (like myself). The food looked good, but I didn't get a chance to try it. But great selection of suds. It's divey (in a nice way) and perfect for a group.",1
"The ribs were out of this world but FORCED/PRESSURE TIPPING??? Is this the new low that so-called ""tipping"" has become? Apparently it has- evident at Fette Sau! *Takes a deep breath* All right, all right, the food first: I ordered the Berkshire St Louis Style Pork Ribs and a small potato salad. The potato salad was okay (too vinegar-y) but the ribs were really good- tender and juicy, pink on the inside. I usually like to have barbecue sauce drenched on ribs but they were good enough without them. However, I craved some deliciousness on my ribs so I tried a couple of the sauces-sweet and spicy-that were on the table (squeeze bottles with no labels). The atmosphere: Where was my cowboy hat, y'all?- country music was playing over the heads of Â chatting hungry barbecue lovers, giving off the vibe of a cafeteria at a ranch in the Wild Wild West. Or maybe an indoor picnic- people sat at three long communal tables in one room where you're elbow-to-elbow with strangers- too crowded (and noisy) for my preference, but what do you expect from a Zagat-rated barbecue joint? If there are no seats, wait until someone has had their fill of BBQ. The service: No sit-down waiter service over here- you ask for the food you want, they weigh the meat, and give everything to you on a ginormous tray then walk up to the register. The girl at the cash register mentioned something about tipping the kitchen staff and hands me the receipt for me to sign since I was paying with a credit card. Ignoring the tip line, I signed and handed back the receipt. She HANDS IT BACK TO ME (if I could put those words in bold, I would) and says that I HAVE to tip 20%. WTF!!!! First of all, it is not my responsibility, or any other customer's responsibility, Â to make sure that the kitchen staff are well-paid. It is up to the restaurant- any restaurant. That may sound B@%chy, but it's true- a tip is a small monetary gift that is given in appreciation of outstanding service that goes beyond what is expected. Don't believe me? Research the history of tipping. Second, how am I supposed to calculate 20% (that's what I heard, correct me if I'm wrong because I hope I am) of the damn bill with people waiting in line behind me? I am not a human calculator. Third, if tipping needs to be forced (?!) let people in line know in advance- put a sign in front of the register. Over the deafening noise, I originally thought that tipping was optional because I could barely hear the girl at the register- that's why I signed and handed the receipt with no tip at first. Afterwards, perhaps I mis-heard the 20%- it could have been 2% (hah!) or 200%. What about other patrons who could be hard of hearing? Bottom line: for a Zagat-rated, #1 BBQ joint that has thousands of patrons a day because of its popularity force customers to tip at the register where other patrons are waiting behind you is absurd. But the ribs were great, and I'm not going to lie- I will go back. But I'm knocking off two stars.",1
"I checked out this restaurant recently and it was good. Â A few gripes about it, but the pros generally outweighed the cons. Â  The pros: Food was flavorful and tasty - the melon gazpacho with jicama/peanut brittle was an interesting take on a classic; the hummus was creamy and the sprinkie of whole chickpeas was a nice touch - in general the food was good. Service was friendly, although they seemed a little overwhelmed with the water glasses taking 10 minutes to be refilled. The cons: The portions just seemed a little small for what you were getting. Â The $9 hummus was kindof small only had 2 pieces of pita, the side of cauliflower, though tasty, was not 'crispy' at all, and despite the fact that I ordered and ate the better part of 2 appetizers and a soft shell crab salad special as my main I was still kindof hungry. Plus the acoustics were pretty bad - so noisy I could barely hear my companions speak. Â  All in all, I would go back, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way.",1
"I feel bad that I live in NYC and am not a huge Chinese fan, but Joe's Shanghai? Ok, by me. First thing's first - be prepared to wait at both the Chinatown and midtown locations. The soup dumplings are all the rave here and they should be. They are good and CHEAP. Just little pillows of heaven. I've gotten a few other dishes here, but nothing comes even close to the dumplings. I could make a meal out of those alone!",1
"I can't agree with the 4-star ratings- I thought the curry was under par and the plates overall were really plain. I got tired of the food right away because all I got was rice, meat and curry with nothing else to really cut through. Yeah it's cheap and service is quick, but the food was simply representative of those facts. Don't think I'm coming back here for my lunch breaks.",1
"When in Williamsburg Brooklyn, Oasis is the place to go for a fast, delicious, inexpensive late night Â chicken kebab sandwich. Â It is right next to the bedford ave stop, so it is super convenient. Â I've been here several times and am always more than satisfied !",1
"First time I came here was when I was waiting for a table at neighboring speakeasy Raines Law Room. Â It has a cute bar in the front area. Â The laid-back atmosphere and the attentive service gave me enough reason to return another time for dinner. Â The Moules Rasta is a good choice if you like a coconut curry sauce. Â It has pieces of apple in it that provide a nice, tart contrast to the broth. Â Fries are nice and crispy. Â We also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, but this is a dish I'd easily pass on next time. Â Stick with the mussels!",1
"Been coming to CSBC for a couple years and always eat here when visiting the city. Not a fan of the wait... but I'll deal with it to get my blueberry pancake fix. It's really the best blueberry pancakes in the city! I'm not a fan of waiting outside in the cold after purchasing a hot drink from inside and waiting for our table to get cleaned up. That's not really good customer service... but I guess it's a New York thing. If you're visiting NYC it's a must to come here for breakfast but prepare to wait in a long line and bring cash! cash only! Indoor seating only. Casual dining. Oh and if you love bacon, try their sugar cured bacon! winnning! I'm a fan! Miss Yelp 2014",1
"Walking in, the space looked small. I only saw like 4 smalls tables and 1 large table upon entering before encountering the bar, which took up a bit of space. The decor is what it is and it gives off a dive bar/lots of fun vibe. People are enjoying each other's company, talking and eating...just enjoying life as is. Cocktails start at $10...so eventually if you're thoroughly enjoying yourself could run about to be about the same or more than your food costs. Large groups beware...BUT they can totally make it work and it's a lot of fun. We had a group of 15 of my closest friends, all lies, but we felt that close by the end of the meal. As you have to make reservations for such a group...we also had the option of doing a prix fixe with 2 or 3 courses. We choose the 2 and that was quite enough aka more than enough food. We got several different appetizers and several different entrees served family style. Now, let's talk about the food! The food: chichurron - ran a little on the thick and greasy side lumpiang barquillos - lumpia is delicious...can't go wrong, and definitely should always get these! pampangan style sizzling sisig - not may favorite thing here and I ususally love sizzling sisig pancit bihon - aka noodles with prawns. these were really delicious and the jumbo prawns were cooked to perfection filipino pride chicken and ube waffle - by far, my favorite item on the menu...at least top 2 chop suey - eh, no necessary pork rib adobo - 2nd fav dish at the menu, sooo delicious, finger-licking long bean - addictingly delicious bok choy - steamed bok choy, but still so good",1
"My first real udon noodle experience! I got the beef, egg (less soupy) udon noodles. So damn good (though maybe not a good meal for someone who doesn't like really salty food). I like how simple the rolls are here. The shrimp crunch roll was alright, nothing to flip over. Got to try the 5 taco roll special next time. Very cool, rustic ambience. Great tunes. Cash only though!",1
Great food and service. Salmon and battered green beans over the top good.,1
"I'm gonna do it, it's getting 5 stars. Â Very accomodating waitstaff found seated us at an awesome corner table, the cocktails were strong and delicious and the raw food bar was tasty and fresh. The shrimp cocktail is very good - should definitely get that if you're in the mood for fresh healthy shrimp and the cocktail sauce was great! Â I had the trout with the brown butter capers on the side = OMG, what a treat. This is an older building, but modern decoration, and eventhough I imagine it gets quite full quite often, they have a nice big bar (and outdoor seating i heard). Â Can't wait to come back again, maybe for a lazy sunday brunch.",1
"I've eaten here more times than I can count now. It helps that they're right around the corner (score!) No matter if it's sit-down, delivery, or take out, their crostini and panini have never disappointed. Ever. My current go-to is the bacon panini with pesto/arugula/tomato because it's fairly simple and light. However, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. Everything's just ..awesome. Flavor's always there, bread's perfect, and they're always very filling. Desserts are good too, and if you're in the mood for a sweet drink on a cold day get the nutella hot chocolate. It's a huge mug of everything great in the world. Overall I just LOVELOVELOVE Il Bambino. Would marry it if I could so we could be together forever.",1
"Came here on a Sunday night, and the place was packed. Â That should tell you the place is pretty sweet. Â The day was pouring rain, so I had to stand inside while waiting. Â That wasn't fun. Â I'm not the smallest guy, so I was constantly in the way, where I was getting mad at myself. Â After about the 4th ""excuse me"", I just popped open my umbrella and stood outside. Got seated, the table is cozy. Â The menu is a fine size, without way too much selection. Â I ordered the couscous. Â I thought it was flavorless (might've been that I was trying to taste too hard. Â You know how you try too hard and fail? Â Ok, probably not, I might be the only person ever to suffer this affliction). Â The hummus on top was good, also, the hot sauce they give you is quite pleasant (not too spicy). Â  If in the area again, I'd give it another go ahead.",1
"Kati Rolls are great, and wide selections. I get their beef kati roll and aloo kati roll are some of my favorite. And for NYC the price is reasonable.",1
"Hair on my food.. I went there for a very special occasion last night and what seemed to be a perfect night for a celebration it turned out a little shy from perfection. The atmosphere and service are really great, lights are dim and it is very romantic apart from being seated about two inches to the next table. Almost every seat was full, but we were quickly seated and served. Don't get me wrong the food was delicious i had the mushroom chicken with risotto, very flavorful and Â moist for a baked and encrusted chicken but towards the end i found a long hair deeply encrusted in my chicken. I gave my plate back to the waitress and lost my appetite. i just wonder, aren't hairnets still a requirement in all restaurants? Needless to say my meal was free but i was still upset such event had happened. My boyfriend enjoyed his salmon and lobster mashed potatoes very much and even ordered the apple dessert because of the Jack Daniels caramel sauce. Its a nice place, just watch little incidents.",1
"Awesome prefix menu. Most classy restos like Ai Fiori may not give me a FULL meal(I am big eater) but this place really do fills me up. And the food is great, I would definitely be again.",1
"Wowzers ... there are a lot of Pio Pio's in the city. I had to make sure I got the right location! Came here on a Saturday night for dinner with friends. walked into a small dining/bar area and thought... how can our friends fit in this place? it's so small... on the search for looking for our friends, we walk behind to the massive dining area. This place is surprisingly huge! With the twigs and branch decor and dark ambiance. The feel of the place is nice. There were a lot of large parties in this place. Food. Honestly... it was solid Peruvian. Had the chicken, sausage, beef, salad, plantains, beans and rice, etc...etc...etc.... everything was good. It's good old Peruvian with a little class. The price goes up a little bit to but for the city I think it's well worth it! Being a jersey girl, I drove in. Found parking right in front of the store! SCORE! :-) Overall, enjoyable evening. Couldn't complain about anything... 1 downfall... the men's room had no running water?!?! Do guys not wash their hands?( Yes, I used the men's room. :-P)",1
"Favorite pizza place inside nyc. Old fashion pizza is the tastiest, doesnt matter what the toppings are, just an old fashion cheese pizza is amazing, soi usually dont even bother with the toppings but sausage is my favorite if it has a topping Located on the stone road in financial district which is a beautiful area.",1
"Sat at the bar as the wait for a table was about 30 mins. Started with dan dan mein which is chewy, spicy, delicious! Â Cucumbers are addicting and a must! Â I poured the sauce which is sweet salty and spicy all over everything! Â Prob would of drank the rest as soup! Â Long pepper beef was tender and even the green pepper were tasty. Cold mung beans noodles were a bit slippery but full of flavor. Pea leaves with garlic were perfect compliment to meal. Dry pepper chicken was perfectly crispy. Worth the wait and return!",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I came here with my best friend for her birthday dinner, just me and her, Monday with reservation at 7:30pm on a summer night. There was no wait and was seated immediately. I ordered almost everything that was recommended by yelpers, including their special of the day. For appetizer: SautÃ©ed Baby Octopus with Garlic, Parsley Olive Oil Bread Crumbs, Tomato Mushroom & watermelon with goat cheese salad (special of the day). Goat Cheese Tart with Shallots ,Truffles, Grape and a Veil of 180 days Aged Swiss Cheese -I enjoyed every single bite of all the appetizers! It was delicious, all of it is a must try. As a cheese lover (and lactose) the cheese tart is absolutely delicious, very cheesy, so don't order unless you love cheese. For entree: Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (Signature) Cassoulet Toulouse's Style ( Cannellini Beans, tomato, Garlic Duck Confit, Slab Bacon & Pork sausage all Braised with Noble Duck Fat : Yummy but Rich !! -PLUS it was a slow night, they added the 4 sides of veggies for us. This delicious dish is very heavy, do not attempt to eat it all by one, unless you love meat and sauce. They put a warning label on it, and I absolutely agree with it! But definitely a great dish to share. For dessert: we ordered the three flavors of home-made sherbet, mango, coconut & raspberry. -Absolute delight! Light & flavorful at the same time! Plus low calories after such a huge meal! This place is also BYOB with no corkage fee. They also work with a wine store that delivers to the restaurant for free with no minimum charge, but only between 3-11pm. Â How much more can we ask for?! This is a must try place in NYC, especially if you love French food. It can hold a large party, but I feel it might be more enjoyable with a smaller number of company. It's a very romantic place. We spend around $55 per person. The price is actually pretty fair for its quality of food and vast amount, especially in NYC. I definitely recommend coming here to impress a fancy girl/boy.",1
"Looking for top notch european delights and unique ingredients that you remember eating when you were in europe and JUST CANT SEEM TO FIND IN THE US? Â well come to despana and you'll find all those wonderful little additions to the food that you are looking for...spicy anchoives, baby cuttlefish, chopped clams, ventresca tuna, canned (in glass) flat beans, cheeses, fresh jamon (up to 168$ per pound mind you). Â Talk about a wonderful place to come to get a picnic in the park together. Â The staff is SOOOOO friendly, and they are totally on Spanish time...you'll see what that means when you come!",1
"Really cool spot -- somewhat of a hidden gem. We ended up here to watch the World Cup. It's a bit cramped when you walk in but it opens up to good sized restaurant. I think they have 4 smaller high tops (4 people) and two longer high tops (~8?). They have a ton of beers available, good number of tvs, and good sandwiches. They also have outdoor seating which is a nice touch.",1
The Bad - Expensive for their ramen - Broth isn't that good.....i think its too thick for me (well just Â the non-spicy broth) The Good - Get the spicy broth one...any of them...its way better than the other ones - Love their take out containers.....very deceiving...seems small but really fulfilling - Many options to pick from ranging from which broth to what type of noodles....i usually just get the recommended noodles The Bottomline- Pretty solid ramen place. It's not the best. Hands down to Ippudo! I'm not a fan of thick broth so that kills the review. There's another ramen place next door. Never tried that one before.,1
"L'Artusi, L'Artusi, L'Artusi. Where do I begin? Brace yourselves people, this has potential to be a long one. Overall, clearly a delectable experience given that I just rated this place at 5 stars. It's more like a 4.5 BUT the manager (whose name is very similar to mine) was spectacular (and cute!) so I rounded up. We were seated downstairs and unfortunately right across from the vent, so it was a bit drafty. Our server contacted the manager to ease our concerns about the temperature and movie shoot level of air blowing through our hair. His solution: Hot Toddy. My friend, hilarious one that she is, didn't realize what she was getting herself into when the manager proposed his peace offering. Needless to say, the gift went to me. :) Our server was either new, having a bad day or was leaving soon as he was a bit stern and later proved to be clumsy as spilled some wine all over the table and my shirt (thank goodness it was white). He apologized profusely. All i'm sayin' is that he should be relieved he spilled it on me instead of my dining companion because she would have had a much harsher reaction than me (which would have been pretty entertaining for me!). Manager man came back towards the end of the meal to ask us what we were having for dessert. Offered up some recommendations and we decided to go with the Olive Oil Cake. And to our delight, he brought us an addtional dessert - Almond Cake with Mascapone and Peaches. Both on the house! Just goes to show you that hospitality counts. And L'Artusi's manager was key. Not sure if the server said anything about the spillage (i'm thinking no) but regardless, Manager man stepped up to the plate, entertained us and hit a home run! Once we stepped out of the restaurant and realized that we had just spent 4 hours eating and chatting. Amazing. Cannot wait to go back and i dont say that about many places in nyc. Our indulgences: Beef carpaccio - Delish Halibut Tartar - too fishy for me, but my friend liked it and once i threw it on a leftover cracker from our cheese order, i liked it too. Scallops - Big win! Summer Squash Salad - Wowzer. Perfect combo of flavors. Just divine. Hanger Steak - Steak was good. Potatoes were heavenly. Make a reservation. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.",1
"Fun spot - I've only come here for drinks and dancing. Â It's totally chill - strong drinks, good music. Â Kind of place you can black out and go crazy if that's your thing.",1
I love their broccoli salad!!! Â  Beef brisket and pork shoulder are awesome. Â I wish they had better table/reservation system.....,1
"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and really satisfied with ALL the dishes served that night. While the menu didn't look so unique, all the food tasted quite innovative and pleasantly surprised me with every bite. Simply, delicious!! Here's what we had: Hot potato chips -- Everybody has to order this right after sitting at the table! These thick and slightly soft potato chips with blue cheese were really popular starter among all the guests at the table. Fried artichokes -- Perfect crispy taste. I'll definitely order again next time. Â  Pot of mussels -- The stock(soup?) is one of the most flavorful I've ever had in mussels pot. wanted a spoon to finish the soup... Â  Fried chicken(Wednesday special) -- Worth coming on Wednesday just for this. The harmony of sweet waffles and Crispy chicken will make you stay happy all night long. Steak salad -- The balance of chunk of beef and the leaves was perfect. It's almost like eating steak with side salad.. I wanna know how they can make it taste so good only with beef and greens... Ricotta gnocchi -- The thick creamy sauce with truffle oil and gnocchi literally melted in my mouth! Chocolate cake -- Quite dense and layer of flavors inside. Well, I usually don't really care for dessert but enjoyed this a lot...! Partly due to the casual decor, the menu price can also be a bit of surprise if you expect village standard. But I think the quality of food here explains more than enough.",1
"I wanted to try Perry St. for so long and was very excited when I saw the name on the restaurant week list. I had to try it. We got there at 7:30pm on Sunday not too busy or crowded. Beautiful sunset light was coming in from outside. We were seated at a rounded table, here we go, I'm ready. I got calamari for appetizer, slow cooked salmon for main dish, and their signature chocolate cake for dessert. Calamari was boring and they put way too much salt. Slow cooked salmon was good, but lacked a punch to it. A chocolate cake was the only one I really liked. Hot chocolate cake + cold vanilla ice cream = perfection. It was just ok overall. I don't know if it's because of the restaurant week or not, but they didn't really impress me other than their chic interior. When we asked them to split a check on 2 cards, they mistakenly put more on my card. They had to come back a few times to fix it and I just gave up at the end and paid more than I supposed to because it was just annoying to keep asking them to put the right amount. I wanted to like this place, but it didn't have the quality to match their fancy interior.",1
"I had a great brunch here. Â Grits were super tasty. Â I loved the pork bites appetizer, fried pork, how can you go wrong? Â Really tasty. Â Service was fast and my friends changed her order like 3 times and they were nice. Â My friend thought portion size was small for price point, which I can agree with. Not a huge menu but tasty. Â We got there at 11am, not busy but quickly filled up.",1
"The food is delicious and authentically Japanese, no doubt about that. I got the ramen noodles (had a craving) and the meat in there was fall-apart-soft-meltingly-delicious!!! The noodles were the perfect chewiness, and my only gripe is not having read the menu correctly, as it was spicy and I would have asked for no spice. I also ordered some chicken gizzards, short ribs and pork loin from the yakitori menu. At $3 - $4 a plate, I would have needed at least 15 plates plus a big bowl of rice to be full. The portions were small, the meat was overcooked.. I wasn't thrilled, and it's the reason why I'm taking off 2 stars --- the price, and the small amount of meat I received that was overcooked is not sitting well with me. I would go back to give it another chance, maybe ordering the short rib bowl with rice instead, but as it stands, I wouldn't really recommend it as a place to eat right now.",1
"Must try the artichoke pizza! It's a serious party in your mouth. Don't even bother with the other slices (marghertia slice was just OK), the artichoke is what you come here for! Â It was really decadent but one slice isn't gonna kill ya. Â We grabbed a slice at the pizza bar and then a drink at the bar. It was the perfect lunch during our Sunday stroll through the city.",1
"Good value for late-night drunk dining shenanigans. The slides and fries are good, and they have reasonably priced beers if you need a nightcap. Not much room to sit, though. Be sure to not be sober when you arrive.",1
"I came here strictly for the fried chicken since it came highly recommended... I don't know.. It was OK, Nothing bad - nothing comforting either. It kind of put me off to fried chicken for a while, which may not be a bad thing ;-/.",1
"What sounds like a stuffy place is full of kind service, adequate food, good drink, and quick water service. Our party of 8 had made a reservation beforehand and were seated in a timely manner. Bone Marrow Poppers: I can see why these are popular. Â Buttery marrow surrounded by flaky puff pastry. I believe a standard order comes with 3, but you can add on additional ones a la carte. Smoked Trout Salad: Â light and delicious. Â The fingerling potatoes are creamy and tender, and the crisp apple cuts into everything nicely. Â To be honest, though, the fish reminds me a lot of smoked salmon. If you order the Steak Tartar, someone will come to your table to prepare it for you- a fun experience. Â The complimentary bread comes with a tzatziki-like sauce, but a little thicker. A solid spot for a small, intimate (also, expensive) gathering. Â I'd say it's better for groups no more than 4. Also, the bar seating seems to be the place to be, as I saw several people having conversations with the bartenders. Â  My Pimm's Cup was good and strong. Â We liked the fact that they had their logo on some of the glassware.",1
"LOVE! Amazing food, tons of vegetarian options, delicious drinks, and friendly attentive service! Â I highly recommend it!!! We stuck to the tapas menu and the Espinacas a la Catalana was my favorite!",1
"I had heard such great things about Num Pang (and have probably walked past it a hundred times) so had really high expectations. I really wanted to try the Five-Spice Glazed Pork Belly, but alas! Â They were all out. Â So I had to make a gametime decision and went with the Ginger BBQ Brisket. Â Maybe this was not the best choice, because I was pretty disappointed in the sandwich. Â First of all, for $8 and the fact that this joint is run out of a stand on the sidewalk, I expected something a little bit bigger (for comparison, this was only about 75% of the size of a bahn mi at Saigon Shack). Â Then, when I bit into the brisket, the meat/fat was super chewy. Â It was actually quite hard to eat as a sandwich, because I ended up pulling the meat from the sandwich when trying to bite it off. Â The flavor was also pretty meh. Â Definitely nothing to write home about. I don't think I will be coming back.",1
"This place is good for brunch- had the eggs Benedict which were very good. The vibe is rustic and cool with a mixed brunch crowd (older, younger, a baby or two) in all size groups. Sunny and open. Also has a communal table. It really is just darling. If it wasn't for the taxi cabs passing by, I would think I was in the countryside. Great to grab a bite with friends and perfect to bring out-of-towners. They will love it.",1
"3.5 solid stars for service and quickness. My east coast trip was mainly focused on food and meeting up with friends. I was so eager to try this place, but was quite disappointed. The ramen was good, but not great. We arrived at 11:45am, and the place opens at 12pm on Saturdays. My friend and I put down our names, and came back at 12 when it was opened. Fortunately, we were the last people to go in, before the next wave of people. The venue is fairly small--probably seats about 17-20ppl. Tip: If you're coming on Saturdays: 1) Arrive around 11:30am to write your name on the clipboard. 2) Walk around the area, and come back around 11:55am. The food comes out rather quickly, so you will probably be in and out within 45 minutes. We were trying to be considerate by not lounging around since there were patrons anxiously waiting to be seated. We both ordered the Totto Spicy Ramen since we were on a food adventure and had to save room for desserts!",1
"My girlfriend and I had a good time here and we shared a few decent appetizers...They had an ok prossecco. Overall the atmosphere was really nice, decadent meets romantic, definitely a place I would return or take a girl for a date...If I weren't a girl already. So take your woman to a cute, fun place or take me!! ( insert winking emoticon here)..:)",1
"LOVED THIS PLACE So let's start with the food. The food was probably some of the best bar food I've ever had. Not too expensive. Quality was excellent. The lamb sliders were probably my favorite, though the group I went with as a whole enjoyed the food. Now the BEER. Yes, they have a full bar. But the beer selection is what you go for...because it was an amazing experience to have so many options. Only those that order drinks get carded...at least on a Saturday afternoon/evening.",1
"Authentic, great price, good location Not many seats in the restaurant, so try to get here as soon as you can. I came in for a weekend lunch, and the place was already full! Luckily, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up. THEY OFFER LUNCH SPECIALS EVEN ON THE WEEKEND! hooray! You can choose between a papaya salad, chicken larb (minced up chicken meat salad) or a soda. I recommend the larb, it has a nice limey citrusy flavoring that goes well with the onion slices it is served with. I got the GuayThiew Tom Yum noodle soup, which is served up with fish balls. Has the sweet and tangy Tom Yum soup flavor, but its not as aggressive as other places. Toppings were a little sparse, only bean sprouts and some green onion. really good food for the price! service is very good too. Just get here early :)",1
Like everything else the price creeps up.... A small jerk chicken jumped from $5.50 to $6.00. Still very good.,1
"Found this spot on Yelp and decided to check it out for brunch with my brother. We arrived relatively early and were quickly seated, though it looked like there were several groups waiting. At first glance, the restaurant seems tiny, but after walking through the narrow space next to the bar, you realize that there are several rooms in the back where happy families are enjoying brunch. We decided to share the Omelette Maison and Omelette Ardennaise. Both were fine, albeit a little on the dry side, but we both liked the Omelette Maison more (something about the smoked salmon sour cream combination with eggs worked really well). My brother also loved the mashed potatoes that came on the side. As a less enthusiastic mashed potato eater (they remind me of the time when I got my wisdom teeth pulled), I thought the potatoes were just okay. All in all, we had a satisfying brunch, but with so many amazing brunch places in the city, I'm not sure if I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1
"Good Japanese home-style cooking... I miss this kind of food A LOT and it is hard to find in New York. Food tastes okay, does not compare to what you can get in Hawaii or Japan of course, but it was pretty decent. Price is expensive for what it is, but reasonable for NYC. I did not give more stars because I felt the service was very poor; I paid before I ate and left gratuity of about $5 but no one even wiped my table and there were still dirty napkins left on there by the last customer. I also did not receive water or any kind of service or attention, so I regretted leaving a tip. This place is very poorly ventilated, and contrary to the sign they have in their window, the air inside is not cool at all. It was quite warm in the restaurant, and after I left I could smell the food/oil smell in my just-washed hair... ugh. I would come back but only for take out, and only when I'm feeling too lazy to make any of this myself (it's very simple style cooking).",1
"Always fresh, special, and delicious! Be prepared for a wait to be seated but totally worth it. I've tried lots and all puts a smile on my face.",1
"I'd say a 2.5 stars. Â It wasn't totally meh but it isn't a-ok either. Â I order a panini and so did my friends. Â The sandwich didn't come with any sides, and the bread was pressed to an inch of it's death. Â The panini flavor combination were great but it didn't come with any sides. From the outside it seemed like the space would be cuter on the insdie -but it felt very dinerseque.",1
"3.5 stars. To venture out away from the usual brunch staples (eggs, coffee and what not), I decided to bring my mom to a specialty restaurant to add some 'spices' to our weekend. Katsu-Hama claims itself to be the only authentic Japanese katsu restaurant in NYC and I wouldn't doubt that. Sure, there are other places that serve fried pork chops, but it's not in the true Japanese style. Interestingly, my mom chose the Berkshire pork tenderloin set instead of the fried version and she actually regretted it as she overheard her neighbors creating crunching sounds next to her. However, she did enjoy her 'up notch' pig. The savoriness was definitely there, actually a bit salty for her. There was a lot of sauce on the dish, that's also cooked with eggs, so it called for a copious amount of rice to balance out the umami flavor. The pork was sliced thinly and very moist. No chewiness present. The side salad was just shredded cabbage with a few sliced cucumbers and a teasing amount of wakame. I had the tofu salad, which shouldn't be called a 'salad' there it was basically a plate of cubed store bought soft tofu rested on a romaine leaf, decorated with a few tomatoes. Wished carrot dressing was available, but would that be an Americanized Japanese salad dressing that's banned from an 'authentic' Japanese restaurant? I have to applaud for the filtered ventilation. There was no sense of greasiness in the air, as I was apprehensive about in a 'fried' joint. Staff service was decent. Needed to ask for tea a couple of times. I would suggest to come during the weekdays for the lunch special (if you're dining in) because only the dinner menu is offered on the weekend. Still not overtly expensive as the oyako don was under $10. In the store front, there is an bento area for lunch take out during the weekdays. If you do decide to come, I recommend trying out the katsu, I mean, this is their specialty.",1
"No question this is one of the best brunches I have ever had. We started off with a watermelon juice they recommended and it was pretty tasty and definitely refreshing after waiting for so long (even though we spent more than half of the wait actually shopping around Soho). Then apps we got the $6 bacon, comes with 4 pieces and that was pretty tasty, but you absolutely have to use their green hot sauce. It has a cilantro kick to it and you can also douse that all over your eggs...Soo good. Breakfast entrees we got: 1. Poached Eggs With Grilled Tomato And Halloumi This was pure bliss, and even more so if you use the green hot sauce they make. The eggs are poached perfectly and you could tell everything was fresh. This was my first time trying Haloumi (a type of cheese made from goat and sheep milk) and it was pretty good as the base. 2. Mediterranean breakfast Friends had this one, it looked delish as well, tons of avocado and chopped up cucumber with seasoning. You can get any kind of egg you want with this and it comes with some pita bread. See picture. 3. Rosewater Waffle The girls at the table could taste the rosewater flavor, either I'm incompetent or they were trolling. I thought this tasted like an average waffle, but the toppings were pretty good. All in all, an average waffle. Dessert: Flourless Chipotle Chocolate Cake Decent chocolate cake, it looked harder than it actually was, it was actually very soft and the fudge whip was really good. The wait is long, expect an hr+ if you get there on Saturday at 11:30. I thought we would only have to wait 30 min but nope this place is just that popular. They have outdoor and indoor seating, outdoor is only for parties of 5. They do not take reservations. I would definitely come back.",1
"Lovely, amazing, sustainable. Fabulous food. Fabulous environment. Fabulous service. As good as it gets in Brooklyn. Great meats they butcher themselves, so it's worth trying everything on the menu. Had the bonus benefit of being there with my sweetheart on a day in March that felt like the hottest day of Spring. We sat for a long time, enjoying lunch, not feeling rushed, and feeling the breeze from the open garden, and just appreciating this place. A bit hipster, but hey, that gives this once ethnic-only community a new edge and exposure that generations of locals can now capitalize on. I think this nabe will stay true to itself...there isn't enough real estate in the area for people to flock to it. And, if anything, The Farm should set the bar for more businesses like it on this strip.",1
Simply the best bbq in the city. So far we've had all of their sides - the sweet potatoes are incredible. Brisket and Brontosaurus Rib are OUTSTANDING. The bront. Rib was probably the best rib I've ever had Wait in line it's worth it !,1
"For the adventurous, this is easily one of the best values in NY. $15 for ramen!? Yes, and it's a bargain. There's a reason this place has more reviews than any other in NYC. Tips from a regular: - Come early. No wait. - Add an egg! Make that two. Don't be shy. - Pork buns. x2 - Everything on the menu is good. Â But the cucumber is worth noting. A lot of people get the shishito peppers. And...oh forget it...everything is worth noting. - Happy hour is fun while you wait. Cheap beer (for NY). - The spicy ramen (Karaka-men) is my favorite. But I like spicy. The restaurant is well decorated. It's so clean!! The service is amazingly efficient. The food is beyond good. This is what you want when you visit or eat in NYC, so just go.",1
Hands down my favorite sushi in brooklyn! Staff is great I even got one of them to eat the last piece of sushi that I could not finish and was surprised with some plum wine. I come here pretty often & the party bomb and pork petty are insanely serious!,1
I LOVE their sauces. Pommes Frites is my friend.,1
"Much akin to Roberta's, the trend of opening up an eatery in a garage is also found at Fette Sau. My girlfriend and I found out about this place a while ago from a friend of hers who had went and made some Facebook post about the great BBQ and outrageously long line. With both of us Â being curious to try, we finally made the trip out a few weeks ago, late on a Monday afternoon. We drove out here, but whether you drive or take the L train, this place is a bit of a hike. After lucking out and finding street parking, we had about 30 or 40 minutes until they opened. It was a warm night, so we just hung out on the street and talked until the sign was turned on and the gate was opened. Since we'd arrived, a few other people had also shown up, but the scene was very calm at their 5pm opening. Inside can be described as casual, cool and hipster. We went up to the counter and asked how we go about ordering. The server asked if it was our first time - it was - and then advised that between the two of us, we'd want a pound of meat. We opted to go with the beef brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork and pork belly, which came out to be 1/4 pound of each, except for the ribs. We were served four ribs, which came out to 3/4 lb, but there are bones in the ribs as well. We also got an ear of corn, a ginger beer and the meal came with four rolls, which comes in handy for dipping remnants of the meat juices and BBQ sauces. About the food, the brisket, pork ribs and pork belly were all really good. They were juicy, tender, meaty and well seasoned. The pork ribs were especially tender and fell right off the bone. The pork belly was a bit fattier than the other meats, but that's to be expected. My one gripe - and it's a big one - was that the pulled pork was extremely dry, which also took away some of the flavor. I don't know if this is the way it's normally served, but I hope they were just having an off night. The corn was also nothing to write home about, tho my girlfriend liked it, so I let her eat it. As others have noted, the seating is communal at long picnic tables. As the place wasn't too crowded, people will sit down next to you, but weren't elbowing or being rude in trying to claim seats. More people did show up as we ate, but the environment was always calm and collectively cool. I did ask when the line starts becoming legendary, to which they replied it usually happens later in the evening. Don't forget to check out the bar while you're here. The list of whiskeys and beers on tap is impressive. My other gripe, other than the extremely dry pulled pork, was that they were out of cider. No deductions for that tho. All in all, except for the pulled pork, the meal was yummy and the food and drink ran us $38. However, while the meal was delicious, I'd have been annoyed if I'd sat (or stood) through a two hour wait to eat here.",1
"Good pizza and a unique atmosphere. I had the Pizza de Fontina, which was pretty simple. Just tomato sauce, fontina cheese (duh), and capers. Not the best pie ever, but satisfying nevertheless. Unless you're really hungry, you can easily have half for lunch and take the rest home for dinner (""Every pizza is a personal pizza if you try hard and believe in yourself"").",1
Fantastic and reasonable Japanese food (not really any standard sushi on the menu) two blocks from Grand Central. Â Expansive sake menu. Â Great atmosphere. Â Authentic Japanese ... bathrooms.,1
"I'm keeping this review simple. Good Food. Good vibe. Long Lines that move fast. I got a quesdilla and frozen margarita with a side of corn on the cob. It was delicious but the LINE WAS OUT THE DOOR. Be prepared to watch the number thingy so you'll know when to pick up your food. Cell service kinda sucks in the back but I'm not sure if that was occuring to everyone. There are 2 lines..one for food and one for just drinks and corn. obviously, the drinks and corn line was super short because everyone was there for food. overall, i'll go again. i heard someone say something about them showing movies on the weekend on the wall which sounds like fun. Also, this place is only open in the summer...from my understading. It's CASH ONLY. Let me repeat...CASH ONLY. Womp. Womp.",1
"This is a classic luncheonette experience. Giant plates of grilled food served in a no-nonsense location. There is one row of counter stools across this small restaurant. We arrived just in time as the line was out the door shortly thereafter. Service is hardly ""with a smile"" as the folks behind the counter are rushing and scrambling to meet the high demand. We had three Bigman Breakfasts, and they lived up to their name. Perfect way to start a long day.",1
"Rating: 3.5 Walked over from Museum of Moving Image and it was farther than we thought...thanks hopstop! We got there at 5:44pm and some dude behind the counter yelled that they don't open till 6pm. Good thing there were chairs outside so we sat and counted down the minutes. Grey clouds were rolling around Steinway St. Me and my friends arrived there first but was seated last...smh!! Drink: Orange Fanta (Mexican Soda) nothing special because it tastes like a regular one Food: My friend got the Voodoo Queen w/fries...portion size was huge but the fries were lacking, soft texture and bland. I got the Chicken & Waffles and absolutely love the Tabasco glaze. At least I crossed this off my list but the commute is too far for me if you live back Steinway St or Astoria definitely stop by! Remember CASH ONLY!",1
Really superb sandwiches that come out reasonably fast. Both veggie and meaty options equally delicious. Sides are a bit pricey though.,1
Still my favorite burger around! Doesn't get better then here. Try their fried calamari as well.,1
"Cute decor, friendly staff, Â got the dishes to share and all three were pretty good. Â Pretty decent size wine selection too.",1
"Really cool concept. Actually came here because Lucali's wanted us to wait for 2 hours...outside. They suggested ""his brothers place"" and we shot over as fast as we could. Happy we did. ""Pizza bar"" directly in front of the coal fired brick oven. All the ingredients freshly scattered in front of the pizza maker. You order it, he makes it in front of the whole place, turns around and pops it in the oven. Love the simplicity. Calzones, pizza, beverages. We had the cheese calzone which was huge, split it between 4 of us. The spicy sausage pizza was great (think of your typical italian sunday sauce sausage), but the olive and onion was even better. They actually messed up the olive and onion order and gave us mushrooms instead. Quick fix and an apology from the pizza maker in front of the entire place. He actually joked that he was gonna fire the guy, and if you saw the kids face, he might have believed it!! Great place, will return!",1
"I love this place- the oyster special is great, although I wouldn't say their oysters are always the best. Still, very solid. I've also had lobster and crab there, and they did not disappoint. Very reasonably priced for the quality and area.",1
"Dubbed a ""sustainable eatery and wine bar."" A simple menu of fresh ingredients and a romantic feel ambiance in Chelsea Market. I came for lunch with a friend who had the Harvest Salad - market greens, local cheese, nuts & Hudson Valley fruit $13. I had a cup of the Market Soup (chilled carrot and ginger) with a side of brown rice, which I added to the soup. A delicious, basic lunch; overpriced for selection.",1
OMG you are so yummy! I got the spicy ramen with cha shiu pork and corn. The broth is spot on for a rainy New York day. Chicken based broth with the spicy sesame oil is a great balance. Not to mention the garlic bits in the spicy sesame oil. The best part a friend of ours offered to wait in line early so we didnt have to wait for a seat!,1
"I'm beginning to lose trust in the taste buds of my fellow Brooklyn Yelpers... This place was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT! The bf and I decided to go to Tom's for brunch yesterday. The food was TERRIBLE! This is how it went down: Let's begin with the syrup...the moment I began pouring I noticed the thick glue like consistency and it immediately grossed me out, I couldn't believe one can gag with syrup, well I did...oh and it was also tasteless. The french toasts looked like they had been pressed by an iron --I have no idea why. I took my first bite and that was the last, the french toasts were extremely hard and tasted old, just like the bacon and the syrup. The bacon was far from crunchy, instead it was hard and even difficult to chew. The scramble eggs were burnt and DRY! The cinnamon and banana pancakes were too doughy and only had 2 slices of bananas per pancake. The guy who took our order and never came back to our table, oh yea, I think you call those waiters, did not wait on us at all, we had to ask someone else for our bill. Total bad experience, $25 down Tom's diners drain. We will never bother to come back. Oh and that ""only cash"" deal is just inconvenient, stop being cheap and take credit cards, it's 2012!!!",1
"I've been waking up in the middle of the night with pangs... craving a certain deliciousness one that can only be satisfied by a marriage of seasoned chicken feta melon pumpkin seed wrap.... and a certain ""wolf sauce."" inevitably, i peel myself off the couch i passed out on and find my way down first ave to the wolf that cried out into the night.",1
"Get there early and ORDER EVERYTHING...try it ALL. Every time I am in NY, (once a month), I am here with a smile on my face :)",1
"good burger. Â big juicy, quick service. Â fries are garbage. Â don't get them.",1
"Saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and decided I had to try those pretzels. The pretzels were very good, but were not hot. The beer cheese they came with was amazing. The real star here is the fried chicken and waffles, probably the best I've ever had.",1
"Very good wonton and noodle, fast service and the AC was working when it was hot outside. Price is a bit high, a bowl of noodle for $7.50 is not a bargain in Chinatown.",1
"The line was long but we weren't waiting for more than 30 minutes. The pizza was so good. SO GOOD. Definitely worth the wait. The only downside was the cramped quarters and the noise level. Other than that, I can't wait to come back to the city for some more Grimaldi's!",1
"Drop everything you're doing and go eat in the Walter Foods backyard before it gets too cold! I had no idea Walter had a backyard, so it was a wonderful surprise. The fresh jams on the stereo were also very welcome. Nothing like eating fresh Littleneck clams while listening to Public Enemy. For my main, I went with the fried chicken because the waitress mentioned that it was THE thing to get at Walter's. I have to admit, it was pretty good. Not as crispy as I'd like, but portions were generous and there was a huge bed of mashed potatoes underneath. Very filling. I also got to try the grilled Atlantic salmon, which was wonderful. I had two cocktails. One was the Fig Side Car, which was made with fig syrup and some sugar on the rim. It definitely tasted like figs, but not that noteworthy otherwise. I also had a Sazerac, which was disappointing. Great date spot!",1
"Urrgh talk of super crappy service! Have been here a few times and the way the hosts handle lines and wait times has always been a bit on the poor side but yesterday took the cake. Two large communal tables were entirely empty and it was pouring outside but BareBurger decided to keep those tables closed until later in case people showed up in the pouring rain. They've added more veggie burger options to their menu (good) but removed their classic veggie burger item (not good, it was way better than the black bean burger). Not going back here again. Also it's pricier than an average burger joint given the ambiance and service.",1
"We went for a Saturday brunch. Â We shared mackerel, apple kimchee, pork bun, fish dish, duck duck noodle, and the corn cream pie. Â It was all yummy, except I still haven't decided whether I liked the corn cream pie or not. Â For those of Asians, think of frozen corn soup on a crust - like it was a little sweet and salty. Â  We were checking out other tables that ordered bo ssÃ¤m and whole rotisserie duck ssÃ¤m. Â They looked good, but we weren't going to order them just for the two of us..... Â  :-(",1
"This place had everything I loved about when I traveled to Latin America. The lunchtime crowd is a bit disorganized, winding, and loud. Bask in it. For a place in the middle of theme park Times Square, I thought Margon had something authentic and a story that hasn't been paved over by chain restaurants or knock-off cartoon characters. You will have to wait in line, but it moves quickly, with everyone excited about Cuban staples like oxtail soup, black beans, and plantains. To eat in nearby Bryant Park, head to the back with the take-out sign in the back, tell one of the many workers what you'd like, and you get shuffled along, switching places with people in front of you and creating some chaos for the newcomers to watch and bask in. I ate my food to-go, as there isn't enough seating for the crowd that masses around the line. Though nobody else at the office seems to be crazy about the close location, I consider more Cubanos almost daily. If you're getting just a sandwich, like the Cuban or the medianoche (swiss cheese, ham, mustard on a sweet roll), just go to the front counter. Be sure to get the works. Don't judge dingy-ness-you never know what kind of magic is beyond the crowds.",1
Good and cheap. This food is a great value. For just a few dollars you can stuff yourself with wonderful flavors and THAT is amazing! I like the Pork Wonton Soup but also enjoy the duck pancake and the fried Wontons. Eat here for cheap!,1
"I am in love with this place! I've braved the heat and come here two days in a row for its hand-pulled wide noodles. The look and chewy texture of its wide noodles reminded me of Pappardelle, my favorite kind of pasta. I ordered Tomato & Egg dry noodles yesterday and Black Bean Sauce dry noodles (zha jiang mian) today. I loved them both, but I think I will order the Tomato & Egg one again next time because it is less easy to find. By the way, it turned out that these two dry noodles are offered at a discount price of $4.25 (original price $5.00) during lunch hours (11 am to 4 pm). I also tried the Pork Pancake two days in a row. The ""pancake"" was served piping hot and super crispy on the outside. The minced pork inside was flavorful and didn't taste greasy at all. I ordered 15 dumplings to take home today. The dumplings were just okay. I think their strength is the noodle. On my both visits, I was greeted by a young lady (probably the wife of the owner) with a big smile on her face. The space was not big, but I didn't feel too cramped or uncomfortable. Somehow, I find this Henan hand-pulled noodles (I mean noodles per se, not considering the soup or sauce) very similar to the noodles served in Xi'an Famous Food. The pancake here is also very similar to that in Xi'an Famous Food as well. Out of curiosity, I checked the map of China, and found out that the Henan province is located right next to the Shaanxi province (where Xi'an is the capital). Maybe it explains the similarity in how they make noodles out of the dough? I wish I have known more to make sense of this. Despite the similarity, I still prefer the noodles (less greasy and more non-spicy choices) here!",1
"Amazing cheap food. They have four locations with the exact same food, 2 on 53rd and 6th, one on 52nd and 6th, and one on 53rd and 7th. The original cart always has the longest lines, but the other carts provide the exact same food. Just make sure you look for the Halal Guys with their yellow shirts and yellow bags. They are only open at night, 7:30pm-4:30am, so don't expect to get the real stuff during the day. The chicken can sometimes be a little dry, but their lamb is amazing. Even people who don't usually like lamb love the lamb from this cart. I always get lamb over rice, smother it in white sauce, add a dab of hot sauce, and get a bottle of water to wash it down. Their hot sauce is VERY spicy even though I'm usually pretty good at handling spicy food.",1
"The owners are nice fellas, and big motor-scooter enthusiasts. See if you can get a free sandwich by telling them about the time you had to laid down your '53 Lambretta to dodge a milk truck on your way to the steel mill. When he furrows his brow, tell him this happened in 1963. When that doesn't work, tell him you're just kidding and that you wish you had some friends.",1
"When I first walked in, I was a little grumpy. Â I was waiting by the hostess area and it was so dimly lit, I couldn't read my kindle and then a giant multi-legged bug fell from the ceiling/flew and landed on my arm and it was gross. Â Then an employee walked by and stepped on my flip flopped foot. Â So I was already feeling like this food better be good. However, once we sat down, my somewhat sour mood dissipated. Â Feast has a really interesting concept of thematic ""feasts"". Â Everyone at the table must order the same feast and it's brought out semi-family style but in smaller, more elegant composed plates (versus the huge platter family style that one typically thinks of). Â It's a cute idea and a cute restaurant. Â The place resembles a farmhouse kitchen with bric a bric like non functional mirrors, picture frames with nothing in them, exposed brick walls, an old fridge, big wooden tables with stools, etc. Â Basically how I might decorate my country's house's kitchen if I ever make enough money to have a country home. Â Although now my country house kitchen sounds really creepy. But the overall affect is cute I swear. Now onto the feast itself. Â We ordered the shellfeast which utilized a variety of shellfish because we liked that it was more variety than say the pig one which used different parts of the pig but still used the same basic animal. Â The shellfish feast had oyster and mussels and clams so it was far more diverse. Â Overall, I can pick apart things I would improve about several dishes but some of them I found very enjoyable and generally speaking I thought the idea of the restaurant was very fresh and fun and the portions were fair so that's why I'm going with 4 stars vs 3. Â The overall experienced added up to 4 (rounded up from a 3.5) even if many of the dishes themselves were a 3. For a course by course breakdown: Oyster Po'Boy: This was a good oyster po'boy, however, the ratio of bun to oyster overpowered the components of this sandwich. Razor Clam Pizza: Flavors were decent but the pizza dough would have been better if it was crisper/thinner. Oyster Escabeche:Very tasy and fresh and clean, one of my favorites of the night. Charred Romaine: I love the idea of a grilled salad and this was pretty good but some parts of the romaine were charred more to the burned side vs delight char flavor. Mussels with asparagus fries: Loved loved loved the asparagus fries. Â I wish fast food restaurant would replace potatoes with baby asparagus fries. I could not get enough of these fries. Â The mussels were disappointing though to one of my dining companions. Â She thought they were too small and too many didn't open. Â That bothered me less than the fact that the flavor was not very interesting. Â It had some heat from the chiles but frankly just a classic white wine, garlic, parsley would have been tastier. Seared sea scallop: Massive scallop in the shell. Â Beautiful presentation. Â Scallop was perfectly cooked although it needed seasoning/salt. Â The fennel and citrus did a disservice to the perfectly cooked oyster. Linguini with clams: Homemade pasta was wonderful with the clams. SautÃ©ed spinach with garlic: Very garlicy and tasty. Pound cake with citrus sabayon: Pound cake slice should be thicker and frankly the candied lime zest reminded me of fruitcake in not a good way. Â I would recommend more pound cake with just the sabayon going forward.",1
"Came here on a Friday night around 7. The restaurant was crowded however the wait was about 15 minutes which wasn't too bad. Let me tell you this place is pretty amazing and the prices are great! The ambiance is very cozy and would a great spot for a casual first date. The restaurant is a tad small and tight making conversations easily heard by the adjacent party. The food is top notched and did I mention cheap?? I had the grilled shrimp and calamari ($8.50) and the special mozzarella salad which were both large portions and very delicious. For my entree, I had the Tagliolini ai Fruitti di Mare... with clams, mussels, calamari, and shrimp sauteed in garlic, extra-virgin olive oil and lite tomato sauce which amazing for $12.50. I would like to come back to try the chicken liver and also the tiramisu. The restaurant however is Ca$h only and the selection of wine by the glass is limited to just a few house wines.",1
"If I were judging only on quality of coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches and cider selection, 5 stars easy. The problem with this place (and places like it) are the crowds it attracts. PURE hipster vibe. If that's your thing, then this is your place. If its not, you will feel totally out of place. Other than that, service is great, food is great, coffee is the best in Astoria.",1
"This place is world class. The atmosphere is romantic. The food is second to none. The prices don't make your eyes bleed. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and my go-to when I want to impress guests.",1
"I was lured here by my old boss (I'd never heard of this restaurant even though it's three streets from me) on the understanding that the Brindle burger has been written up as being in the same league as the Minetta Tavern burger. Â That's such a bold claim that I had to try it. Â We started off with the chicken wings which were juicy and huge and the crispy pork belly which was just a lot of lettuce and burnt pork. Â Then came the burger which was good, don't get me wrong, but nothing in comparison to Minetta. Â Cute restaurant but not sure I need to go back.",1
"I love Spanish food, I am also very picky about Spanish food, I've stayed with women way longer than I should have based solely on their cooking of Spanish food. I've eaten here three times now and had three different things and they have all been delicious. 1. Mangu. For those that don't know, Mangu is a platter of mashed green plantains, fried dominican cheese, Dominican salami/ham, fried egg and onions. This may sound simple but making it right is not. The mashed plantains is perfect, and the presentation of the different parts of the Mangu is on point. I only which they gave you a slice of avocado to go with it. 2. Sancocho. Sancocho is also called spanich soup, made with pretty much everything. I once told a girlfriend's grandmother that I loved her over her sancocho. This one is not that good but its still pretty damn good. 3. Rabo Guisada con tostones (Oxtail with plantains). This is absolutely delicious, the oxtail is perfectly cooked, and the tostones is soft, nothing worse than choking on hard tostones. I love this place and their food, you will too.",1
"The tonkotsu and miso ramen here is to die for. Perfectly viscous, fulfilling the definition of umami, like the warmest hug on a cold day - but for your mouth! Haha. The pork belly is also quite tasty, but a little fatty for my liking - splitting hairs really. Been twice already, but it's quickly becoming my go-to spot when I'm in the neighborhood. In short: GO THERE. Get the spicy miso ramen :D",1
"I wanted to LOOOOVE the Gander, the way I love Recette, but alas, that is not the case. 2 people shared the following snacks and apps. Â We weren't really into any of the entrees. From best to worst: Brisket tots - Super original and tasty Buffalo Sweetbreads - Also super original and tasty Shimp au Jus - Perfect little bites, tasted good nothing original though Calamari salad - Tasted fine but nothing special... just fried calamari on romaine lettuce... Cauliflower side - It was good but Â was sort of overpowered with some crazy spicy Fluke Crudo - Absolutely GROSS, the prawn was mushy and the fluke was stringy and the broth was crazy salty. Completely inedible. The service was ""whatever"", the waiter was nice enough when he actually came around which wasn't super frequently. Â Mostly I was surprised that no one asked why we didn't finish any of our food (which i have experienced at many decent restaurants in manhattan). I noticed many other diners also didn't have clean plates soo.... I assume I am not the only one who felt this way...",1
Love the hand pulled noodles and dumplings!,1
"We were very excited to find Ootoya when they first opened. Â The plusses include a nice space, very friendly wait staff, and a very reasonably priced menu for Japanese food quality and NYC rental prices. Â The daughter loved the chicken rice bowls. Â I loved the take on sweet and sour chicken with an emphasis on the sour. Â The sushi is of good quality.",1
"I've been here for both Sunday brunch and weekday dinner and I would probably recommend it for brunch. If you come on a Sunday, there is always a line (although most people give up so it moves quickly) so expect a 10-20 minute wait. The line really seems to pick up around 1-2pm, so if you can come earlier, you'll wait less. The brunch food is pretty good, I ordered the steak and eggs and that was delicious. Even the spinach paste was interesting. I'm not sure they understand the concept of 'medium' steak though, as bloody red on the inside isn't it, especially for a $10 cut of meat. Still delicious. The dinner I had there was OK, ordered the thai chicken breast (aka. chicken breast with a light peanut thai sauce). It was slightly dry though, and there was not enough sauce there to give it flavor. Overall, much better as a brunch location.",1
"A really enjoyable evening at a very fun new place. Â I knew nothing about Gato except that my husband badly wanted to go so we went. Â We walk in to a packed restaurant and bar and the hostess lets us know they're running mostly on time (and mostly on time at trendy new places is 15 - 30 minutes late). Â We didn't mind, went to the packed bar for a drink, thought it was going to be impossible to get one but the bartender came over quickly and offered to transfer our drinks to our dinner table. Â Sweet. Â  The decor is a darker version of ABC kitchen but very low key, wood tables, open and fun. Â Nothing fancy and the dress is really anything goes. Â Our server was helpful and quick. Â The wines were ok, also nothing special, we tried 4 different glasses and nothing hit. Â  We ate: Oven roasted shrimp - pretty good, nothing special, I would order different next time Charred tomato salad with wheat berries and goat cheese - really good Rabbit - really good Kale, artichoke, egg and mushroom Paella - also really good, their signature dish for a reason Charred Broccolini - very good. Â  I was really impressed that the hottest new place focuses their menu on vegetables. Â I love it and it's right up my alley. Â  More than half the menu were veggie based dishes. I fully support that.",1
"Man oh man, the Minetta Burger I must say has to be if not head on with a Shake Shack burger (in slightly different brackets of course), after-all, Minetta is a one-star Michelin. I came here last Friday night with my boyfriend for a drink and burger. Ordered the Minetta Burger medium cooked and a Pimm's cup to drink. The bun is softer than it looks, and the meat is just airy and delicious. If I could describe the Minetta Burger in short, it would be French Onion Soup in burger form. The fries that came along with the burger were crunchy on the exterior, soft on the interior. Â Pimm's Cup; spot on. Definitely make reservations. We came here around 9:30pm on a Friday night and the host said they were booked until 11:30pm (and they close at 12 midnight). If you happen to just walk in, and if you don't mind the crowd waiting for a table, seats for two at the bar are fairly fast and decent. The host said it would take about 30 minutes for a seat at the bar and it ended up being 5 minutes. And the service was really good. Our food came out quick and our bartender made our drink right in front of us. 5.0 for the food 5.0 for the service 4.0 the crowd and wait 4.5 for the ambiance (i love the classic new york look, but i couldn't really see my burger)",1
"It was OK. I've been to both Traif and Xixa, Traif's sister restaurant, and personally think that Xixa is MUCH BETTER. 3.8/5.0, I'd say. We ordered: Salt and Pepper Shrimp - too salty, though it was yummy paired with the sweet potato cubes Tuna TarTar on Fried Eggplant- bland, nothing special Bbq Ribs Slider- probably the best of all the dishes we've tried. Very delicate flavor and was not overpowering. BUT it only comes with 2 tiny sliders, so each additional slider will cost you $5. Strawberry Ribs- good and different, worth a try Sauteed Broccoli Rabe with toast & fried egg: the thought of it was interesting, but the broccoli rabe was overcooked, which is not how I like the dish. Without the egg, the toast would have been very very bland. Dayboat Scallops with Squash Risotto- Good. Though pieces of the rice in the risotto was still very hard... which is not how Risotto should be like! Lamb Tenderloin- the hummus it came with did not pair well with the dish, making the taste very weird... would not recommend Buffalo Styled Frog Legs- not worth it.. the buffalo sauce overpowered the sweetness frog legs are supposed to have. Maybe they should have diced the celery and placed it on top of each leg instead of randomly throwing 2 thin slices Â in there. Bacon Doughnuts- don't know what's the big hype about these.. they're not original and the taste is not over the edge. Many other stores have fried doughnuts with the exact taste as this dish, minus the tiny bits of bacon Panna Cotta- such a depressing dish. Panna cotta is my favorite dessert and Traif did not meet my standards in this dish.. it wasn't as light as it should be and was not aromatic. Depressing.",1
"I pass by woorijip so often but never walk in. A friend of mine brought me here last week, and I now know what I've been missing. Great place. You pretty much pay as much food you eat. Whether you're extremely hungry and can afford it, you get a lot of food. If you're just in a mood for a Korean food for a snack, you get a little amount of food. There are many options. Great opportunity to try different types of Korean food at a low cost. One less star because some of food were cold. I'm sorry but tteokbokki does not taste good cold. I was there at 10pm, so I'm assuming some trays were sitting out for a while.",1
Get the tasting menu! Everything here is amazing. Menu often changes so every time I come here there's always something new to try. Never disappointed. Recently chef had fried soft shell crab with was done to perfection. Service is also great. I try to get here right around the time they open so that I can get the garden seat. The cocktail selection is not extensive but I tried most and they are all pretty good. Lets not forget the bacon glazed donuts. Need I say more? I always take some home for my daughter. Can't wait to go back soon.,1
"Overhyped, so I'm deducting a star for that. They charge entree prices for appetizers. The pizza is good, but not the best in the city by any stretch of the imagination. Plus, it's out of the way. You're going to Bushwick for a pick up joint, and a hipster one at that. We're talking 47yo men who sleep on futons and don't change their underwear. If it's a charred crust you're after, try Motorino. If it's just stupid names like Cheeses H. Christ (some basehead couldn't take the next logical leap and call it Cheeses H. Crust?) then you're seriously cheesy.",1
"For a late lunch, I got to enjoy the turmeric beef with asparagus and green beans. Spicy, but delicious! If you order take out, you also get a massive container of fluffy jasmine rice. To top it off, prices are way reasonable, which seems to be a theme in that area.",1
"I came here b/c all the hype on yelp and the foodnetwork...maye even the travel channel. Â This place is popular! Â Of course, I ordered the blueberry pancake and my fiancee ordered a mushroom omelette. Â Now the pancakes with the syrup is supposed to be what this restaurant is famous for...but though I can tell that this was well made, I just didn't get floored by the it. Â Almost wished I had ordered the vegetarian sandwich instead. Â My financee's omelet was great, but nothing to call home about. Â We also had the herb and goat cheese scone, which is good, and went really well with the raspberry preserve on the table. Â Actually, the preserves was the highlight of the meal for me. Â I'm glad I checked this place out, but will not be returning here again. Â It's not in a central location and the wait (1 h 15 m) is too long for breakfast food.",1
"I'm not a huge fan of macarons in general, but four stars for the Parisian/girly girl setting and the variety of cute gift boxes at Laduree. I go to Laduree mostly for the gift boxes (Hello Kitty, Christian Louboutin) rather than their macarons.",1
"Went here for lunch with my parents when they came to visit. Â We enjoyed their lunch special, $17 for a salad and trio pasta sampler, which is unlimited. Â The restaurant is cozy and service is on par. Â Caesar salad was great and the pasta was ok. Â It seemed like they cook it in big batches for this lunch special, and therefore isn't the freshest. Â Some of mine was cold. Â I would like to go next time and try an entree instead of the pasta special.",1
such an adorably cute place. so country like. i love it! service is very friendly. the food was amazing! i got the po'boys sandwich...it was massive but ooh so good. sweet potato fries were delish! my friend ordered the jambalaya and she enjoyed it. reasonable priced. overall wonderful exp.,1
"Overrated. I heard how amazing this place was and I just had to check it out. No wait to be seated on a Friday at 6 pm. THE OKAY: - Â Tagliolini Ai Frutti di Mare - I liked that the seafood was fresh but flavor wise it was okay. Nothing amazing. - Lasagna - Great with additional parmesan however I thought it was a tad bit SALTY. Taste is definitely unique not like other lasagna I had in other places. It has ground beef and thick sauce. The sauce wasn't smooth. I think it might be the basil or some kind of herb that makes it taste different. Â  CON: - the WAIT for the food was LONG. The couple next us was seated probably 20 minutes or so after us and they got the food that same time we did. It's not like I am pressed for time but I am just a little annoyed that they had to make all the other table's food before they started serving it. It's like they had to wait to heat up all the lasagna orders that were made in the last 30 minutes before they started serving it. I guess it is their way of efficiency but it's not really fair for the table that put in the order 40 minutes ago versus the person that placed the order 10 minutes ago to get their food at the same time. Overall, Bianca's Restaurant is just ok. I had high hopes for it. But it fell a little short of my expectations. I might come back just to check out their Brodetto di Pesce (Adriatic Stew) and that's about it. NOTE: CASH ONLY",1
CASH ONLY. ATM RIGHT OUTSIDE. Been a regular here for over 15 years. It has been just as good as day one. That has to count for something. I love the food here. Its always ridiculously packed and lines for a half a block at times on weekends. The food is therefore fresh. The meat is seasoned so well. The chicken is always grilled to perfection. The falafel is crispy and moist. The hummus is spot on. I like the lentil soup too. There is very little room for sitting and it just got smaller. Only two hightop tables now for standing room. Two small benches outside. Â They have amazing honey pistachio almond walnut filo pastries. Expect to drop about $10 for a sandwich and a soda. Or like $13-15 for the platters. Open super late. I have never been to the other locations since this is like 2 blocks away but its the original and thats always the best.,1
"Authentic Mexican food and great drinks. Try the chorizo cheese crisp with a margarita. The space is super small, so go early, sit at the bar to expect to wait a while.",1
"One word to describe this restaurant is trendy. A people watching, fashion catching, delicious experience. Located close to the fashion district, with staff that looks like they belong in a fashion magazine. Indoor and outdoor seating. Must try their mac&cheese options!",1
"How you should order a Cuban at Margon (....I think so, anyway. Â Correct me if I'm wrong): 1) Walk in - the sandwich counter is immediately on your left 2) Tell the sandwich-ninja you want a Cuban 3) Pay at the register, conveniently located right next to the sandwich counter 4) Wait a couple of minutes for your sandwich, take it out with you, and enjoy. How I ordered a Cuban at Margon: 1) Walk in - get confused 2) Go all the way to the back, getting in line at the ""Take Out Orders"" sign 3) Pick up a tray 4) Put the tray back......I'm doing takeout, what do I need a tray for, stupid? 5) Ask for a media noche......no media noche today :-( Â  Get a cuban instead 6) ""Do you want the combo?"" 7) Think to self, ""No, not really."" 8) Say out loud, ""Yeah!"" 9) Ask for red beans with my platter of sides. Â Receive black beans. 10) Receive my rice/beans/chicken/plantain container, a bill for 9 bucks, and an empty paper bag that says, ""1 CUBANO"" 11) Bump into people with my awkwardly large backpack. Â Receive dirty looks. 12) Walk to the register and pay 13) Go to the sandwich counter, tell the sandwich-ninja I want a Cuban with everything on it 14) Wait a couple of minutes, take my sandwich out, and enjoy. As you can see, my general confusedness and awkwardness led to this being a much more complicated transaction than it probably should have been. Â Hopefully I'll manage to change that the next time I'm here. Â But was it worth it anyway? Â Hell yes! The Cuban here is delicious, with a bread:meat:cheese:pickle:sauce ratio that is just about perfect . Â Generous but not devastatingly huge layers of roast pork, ham, and salami. Â Enough of a melty blob of Swiss cheese that it covered the whole sandwich, but didn't overpower it. Â Fresh bread that's fantastically soft with just enough grilled crispiness. Â Enough pickles and mustard to add some nice sharp flavors to contrast the glorious savoriness of the meat. Â Just an extremely well put-together sandwich. Â I'm not sure why so many people here are wussing it up and going on about it being massive, too - this sucker was perfect for lunch. Â Even with all of the meat and cheese on it, it wasn't too heavy at all. The sides that I got thanks to semi-accidentally ordering the combo were alright, but kinda weirdly served. Â I got a small plastic container jammed with a ton of rice, a bit of black beans, 2 small plaintain slices, and a couple pieces of roasted chicken. Â The chicken was fall-of-the-bone tender and DELICIOUS! Â So much so that I'll probably give it a try the next time I'm here. Â But there was too much rice, not enough of everything else, and it was all kinda weirdly jammed together in the small container. Â It probably would have been better off served in one of those aluminum things. This is a busy, friendly place, and they really know what they're doing with their food. Â Definitely worth a stop for lunch if you're in the area. Â And worth bending your definition of ""in the area."" Â 15 blocks away counts. Â Right?",1
Personally it didn't live up to the hype for me. Thought the food was average and overpriced.,1
"Came here for a late brunch. The food was tasty, but to no fault of theirs, I was imagining something different.. as I was dreaming of Jack's Wife Freda. I ordered the Shakshuka. Tasty. but not Jack's wife freda at all. B had the Mediterranean Crispy Dough, lots of food. Dough was tasty",1
"Fancy Mediterranean is the way to describe Ilili! The restaurant itself is modern with subtle lighting that makes the dining experience feel intimate yet spacious at the same time due to its higher ceilings and lots of diners! I have been to Ilili several times and each time the service has been excellent with the servers attentive and ready to help with suggestions. The food is always enticing and full of flavor. Review of a couple of things we have had in the past: - Brussels Sprouts- with fig jam, walnuts and grapes....so yummy. I know this sounds like the weirdest combination but it really works. My husband who doesn't even like brussel sprouts loves them! - Â Falafel- comes in little squares, they are always very crispy and crunchy so if you like softer falafel's then these aren't for you! - Batata Hara- fried spicy potatoes....whats not to love! I always appreciate the fact that after finishing the bowl of potatoes there isn't a little pool of oil at the bottom! - Mouhamara- I personally love this dish due to the sweetness of the pomegranate molasses and will order it wherever I find it! If you don't like sweet dips then I would steer clear, but I feel this is one dip one should definitely try! - Hummus- good hummus, I've had better but this isn't bad in the world of hummus's - Rkaykat- cheese rolls, yum! Fried to crispy perfection and filled with gooey yummy cheese :) - Chicken Shish Taouk- chicken is always tender and juicy! It can get to be an expensive outing here but that's why I called it ""fancy"" Mediterranean. It's a great spot for a date or just out with friends as they have the space. I have seen big groups here and plenty of couples! So if you're in the mood for dressing up and feel like having Mediterranean then definitely give this place a try! Its definitely worth checking out!",1
"I had dinner at Coppelia tonight, which was fantastic as usual. A restaurant-ish diner with very friendly staff and solid food, plus good drinks. Â  The nachos are fresh and way better than your average - a great starter for the table. The lomo saltado was the favorite of the night (definitely a must-order), but the cubano sandwich and the quesadilla were also devoured. Maduros and brussel sprouts were excellent choices for sides and enjoyed by all. Deliciosa!",1
The gelato here is delicious - try the pistachio and hazelnut. It's also my go-to place for coffee -- AMAZING. The rooftop beer garden here is a pretty nice place to chill as well. p.s. there's a CLEAN bathroom in the back near the beers.,1
"The atmosphere is very nice, albeit toned down, and the service is excellent. Everyone was very nice and friendly. The food was imaginative, but didn't quite hit the mark for me. It's only based on my opinion, but I thought the fried chicken had strong flavors at first, but lost a good bit of it's flavor. I wasnt a fan of thet Truffle oil honey. It was interesting at first, but I think i've just been burned out on seeing truffle oil at every restaurant. The Kale salad and mash was nice, but the fried chicken itself wasn't that good for me. I see most people love it, so it's either not my thing or I just had bad luck on the way it was spiced. We had the seasonal New Zealand veggies, described to be sort of like asparagus. It was very crunchy and much too bitter to be compared to asparagus. The potatoes and peanuts it was served with balanced it out nicely, but the veggie itself wasn't that flavorful. the Foie Gras was very rich, i would suggest that to anyone who likes Foie Gras. My wife had the burger and loved it. I am sure I would love other things at this place, the beer selection was great and the service was amazing, but I wanted to try some great fried chicken (since everyone loved it so much) and it just missed the mark for me. Again, I'm sure it's just my taste, people really seem to love it.",1
"So thrilled that BCD is back! I feel like it has been gone for years. I thought I could move on, but it turns out that I never really did. Aside from the familiar red, green and blue sign, the new location is not recognizable. The new space is much larger than the old location. It looks new, bright, and spacious and even has a second floor. I came here the other day for lunch and was seated immediately. They still give you a whole fried yellow croaker as part of your appetizer! The rest of the side dishes were good but typical. Of course, I got the soondubu. I tried the mushroom one this time. The tofu was just as good as it was when I last had it--the actual tofu was quite soft and the broth was very rich and flavorful. They also prepare your rice in stone pots in front of you and add barley tea to the remaining rice at the bottom of the pot to create a rice soup to drink, which was extremely good. So happy and will definitely be returning to satisfy all my tofu cravings!",1
"I tried Grimaldi's when i first visited NY & im happy my bf took me here! You get to put ur own toppings! I think i had sun dried tomatoes, sausage & something else.. It was soo good!! Nothing compared to california pizza hahaha",1
"Came here Saturday for brunch around 12pm with a group of 10 and they were able to set up a table in a decent amount of time. I had the croque Madame $13, coffee $2.50, and shared pancakes with 4 other people $10. The portions are huge!!!! Â Croque Madame was ok/good. It comes with fries or salad so I chose fries. Fries are pretty good. Coffee was coffee. Nothing special just free refills. The pancakes are massive. It's basically a giant 2 layer cake with fruit and syrup. It's very thick and dense. I thought it was ok, not as good as everyone says it to be. It also takes an extremely long time to make so while everyone else is eating you'll be waiting for it to come out if that's all you order. Â There's street parking all around the area.",1
"I've been passing by Cha An for a few years now, and only recently went in to check it out. Wow, look what I've been missing! Very Japanese in decor, feels very authentic. Cozy and cute, dark and comfy, like a little oasis from the craziness of the city. They have lots of food options, and of course, tea. I can't wait to go back and try the food. For my first visit, I had a pot of black tea and a couple of green tea macarons. Delicious! When you go, you MUST check out the restrooms. They have the fancy Japanese toilets. If you've never seen or experienced one, go now. It's so cool, so high tech, so Japanese. See for yourself and tell me you are not impressed, I dare you!",1
You think you know pizza? You don't know anything. Paulie Gee flips the script and does things with pizza you could have never imagined. The man himself hovers around the dining room chatting it up with everyone which adds a great personal touch. Paulie Gee is a PIZZA GENIUS. You'd be a fool to think otherwise.,1
"The food here is decent. Definitely not what I'm used to seeing when going to a Korean restaurant, but I feel like this place presents in a way that's more palatable to people not used to eating traditional Korean food. It's also a lot more expensive than traditional Korean food. Put in the extra effort to look for an actual Korean restaurant, and you'll probably have a better meal.",1
"This is one of the best Thai spots I've been to in NY - and there are a TON here. Â For starters, I had the taro wontons and black out noodles. Â Both were delicious, and while they were sweet dishes, the sweetness was just right, not overpowering. Â For the main course, I had a pumpkin curry and the obb woonsen with fish fillet. Â The fish fillet was one of the best Thai dishes I've had - lightly fried, with tender meat that melts in your mouth. Â The accompanying vermicelli and vegetables was flavorful without being oversalted, which is usually the case with these types of dishes. The only complaint I have is the speed of service, but in terms of food quality this place is superb.",1
"I moved from Brooklyn to Harlem about 8 months ago, and the #1 thing - HANDS DOWN - that I miss about this area is Le Barricou. I have only been here for brunch, but BOY HAVE I BEEN HERE. I honestly can't even remember how many times I came here. Why did I keep coming back, you ask? One. The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious. Two. The prices are completely and almost unreasonably reasonable. Three. THE FOOD. The food is really just amazing, both for what you pay and just in general. The fries are PERFECT. The french toast is amazing. I love the vegetarian egg white omlette as well. The pancakes are melt-in-your-mouth good - but be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for them, and be hungry because they are HUGE. I don't want to ramble on and on about how great this place is but let me just finish by saying that since I've left Brooklyn, I haven't been able to fill the hole in my heart. Le Barricou, you are my one true brunch love.",1
"This is one of my favorite restaurants, Â food is delicious, great variety in dishes, Â great Â service Â and friendly Â staff.",1
"As a Hell's Kitchen resident, I've been a regular at Kilo since the wine bar opened. Â A good variety of wine options. Â And very creative, well-prepared food selections. Kilo now has introduced a weekend brunch -- and you really need to stop-in for a taste. The menu has good variety, a few entree salads, egg dishes, cheese platters, and several sides. Â (A cut above the neighborhood's pancake and Belgium waffle diner options). The duck salad is incredible. Â The crabmeat frittata is another tasty standout. Â The duck fat potatoes as a side are a good complement. Â And you'll want refills of the San Francisco-based Blue Bottle brand coffee. Kilo's is a comfortable space, great neighborhood hang-out spot. Â The staff is very friendly, and knowledgeable about the food / wine options (always a huge plus, but not always a given with local restaurant wait staff). Definitely grab a few friends and head to Kilo -- for brunch, lunch, or dinner.",1
"Long walk but it's worth it. The Ca Ri Ga (chicken curry) and Soun Nuong Xa (grilled pork loin) are the standouts. Love the Banh Xeo app (crepe) and the tapioca. My favorite restaurant in the Morgan/Jefferson stop area, maybe my favorite in NYC.",1
"I love love love this place. Unpretentious, inexpensive, delicious. Get the falafel sandwich and the hummus. Great place to start your night in the West Village.",1
"It's more of a 3.5 stars but I prefer to bump up than down. Its also BYOB which is a definite plus. We ordered the Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao which is their pork soup dumpling. It has a delicate skin and a slightly stronger ginger flavor. It's good but there are better options in Chinatown. Then again this is a hipper restaurant in the East Village. I enjoyed the scallion pancakes which were crispy and thin but not oily - have it with the vinegary dipping sauce - yum! We also tried the ""five kinds of dim sum"" which is five different types of steamed dumplings including chicken, pork and a minced pork with spinach option. Last we had the Shanghai Noodles which is sautÃ©ed medium-thick noodles with pork and a bit of sliced bok choy. It had good ""wok flavor"". Overall I'd recommend it for Chinese food in the EV, it's reasonably priced and its BYOB!!",1
"Obviously their mussels are good. I went with my gf and we ordered a full order of mussels and the steak. Honestly, I was quite surprised at how tasty the steak was, we both enjoyed it very much. Word to the wise, if you're sharing the mussels I would recommend the appetizer portion. The entree portion is ridiculously huge!",1
"Creamy corn soup with popcorn, is tasty but it's cold, and reminded me a bit of cereal. Belly charmer, is a yumness treat. Diggin the pistash! The mob burger was tastilishious. Lemon cheese cake with blueberry compote, sweet and tasty, crunch on that coconut. Good stuff and there's no meat in site ;) Communal table, social eating - cool!",1
"I've finally found it. The perfect $5 sandwich. I thought that having a sandwich for lunch every day was a luxury I would never be able to afford, except for maybe if I was willing to stoop to sketchy corner delis pushing old vegetables and Boar's Head garbage. Normally the tradeoff with the cheap Banh Mi is that it's gamey and smelly, and comes with low-quality ingredients. Couldn't be further from the truth in reference to this place. I absolutely love every part of it, crisp fresh vegetables and tender meat on a huge toasted hero roll. Doesn't get any better than this.",1
"Really liked this place a lot. Went yesterday with around 7 of my friends. We were seated right away in the back--long wooden table right next to the wine room. Pasta dishes are really good (I had this whole wheat dish but I also sampled the raviolini, and gnocci--both great) and everything seems fairly priced. The Tuscan Panzanella (a salad with bread, tomatoes, olive oil, red wine vinegar, capers, garlic) was delicious and this is coming from somebody that hates garlic more than anything in this world and not that fond of tomatoes (nice Italian I am -huh?)! It's small, a little tight (but not too bad), and I love the lighting (intimate) and the chandeliers... Service was also very good--friendly wait staff... I'll be back without a doubt :)",1
"I came here with my vegetarian friend and thus ordered separate dishes. She had three different dishes of veggies and especially loved the spinach one. I ordered the Amber Jack sashimi and duck soba (cold), which was recommended as a ""must try"" per our waitress. The sashimi was decent, but nothing close to Azabu standards. The duck soba was just alright, but I definitely regret that I gave in to the waitress' recommendation. Next time, if I do come back, I'll stay away from the duck and try the Uni or Tuna Soba. For dessert, I ordered the 3 homemade scoops combo for $6 and tried their wassabi, yuzu and black sesame ice cream. Surprisingly, I thought the wassabi ice cream was awesome and was actually my favorite amongst the three! The yuzu was good as well (has a citrus taste to it) and the black sesame was average. Anyway, okay experience here and would recommend it if you're a soba person (noodles are done really well), but would definitely skip the duck soba. PS: If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free beer or shot of sake!",1
"I've been dying to try this place out and I finally did yesterday. It wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I got the strawberry & coconut waffles with fruit (wanted plain waffles but they didnt' have any) and my boyfriend got the Penny Egg Sandwich with bacon and home fries. His sandwich got heavy after a while being that it was on a croissant and I only had two slices of my waffles plus the freshly cut strawberries and papaya. Their grapefruit juice was too sour to my liking but the cranberry juice was really good. Overall, I think I'd give this place something from 3.5-4 stars. I might be back to try the nutella french toast which is only served on weekends and the abuelo's egg sandwich.",1
"very nice ambiance and atmosphere, place was packed on Monday night (good sign) great selection of wine (any place that has Txakolina has my vote) and superb food as well as selection of tapas something for everyone's taste. had: 1. Quail with Figs and Salsa Jamaica 2.Lamb with Harissa and Pickled Peppers 3. Scallops with Tomatillos con Pepitas Â  4. Pumpkin and Goat Cheese Croquetas Bit pricey for tapas but everything else wonderful.",1
I have been here maybe 10 times and each time have had the same thing: cappuccino and tiramisu! I told myself that I must come back for a meal but it hasn't happened yet (but it will soon). The cappuccinos and tiramisu are amazing. The inside is cute and intimate (you can also sit outside when weather permits). Waitresses are always sweet and they also have a full bar! Lovely spot on St. Marks.,1
"Management and servers are all nice and the place is really fun too! They even have bibs for you - young and old - to wear because it gets messy when you eat there! We enjoyed everything including the oysters, fried fish (I think it was catfish and fries), shrimp and crab legs. The crawfish was also good but too small to be worth the trouble.",1
"Ten stars for the decor, 3 stars for the food, four starts for the drinks, and 3 stars for the good, though not always great service. Upon moving to the kips bay area, in a wasteland of fratty, generic bars, Whitman and Bloom is the only one that really stands out. The space is awesome, they have a great happy hour (all day on Sundays!) and their cocktails are decent. I would say I have been at least 7-8 times since moving to the neighborhood. It is the definition of a neighborhood joint. The food is mixed, but they have enough decent items to outweigh the bad, and the prices are reasonable. I love their cocktails, especially if you get one during their generous happy hours (till 8pm every night and all day on Sundays! YAY!). Overall don't expect any culinary wonders here, but service is always friendly, drinks are usually good, and it is completely different from almost all the other bars in the area, which is a plus for me. Check it out!",1
"I'm an Italian food lover so needless to say Osteria Morini was bound to be on my to-eat list and I couldn't wait to get my hands on their goods. Rustic setting, attentive staff and delicious food. Not to be cruel by bringing up any cons but it's better I warn future patrons rather than they be surprised with what they'll encounter at OM. The several plates of pasta were all too salty. Perhaps our salt tolerance is low but everyone in our group agreed that the chef was pretty generous with the salt. The gelato was okay at best. The only flavor that stood out was the espresso. The bit of coffee bean won the points in my book. Now about the staff... I felt rather rushed to get everything done and cleaned away from our table. I swear they wanted us to skedaddle and I didn't appreciate that. Lastly, I won't suggest the coat or umbrella check. It took quite a while for them to retrieve our umbrellas and a herd of patrons ended up circling around the door waiting for the checked items. Not sure why it was so incredibly inefficient but hey, you've been warned.",1
"I've been going here for years and it's an awesome place. It's super tiny and can take a very long time to get a table for a weekend brunch. I've never strayed away from the chicken couscous because whenever I do, I regret it. The other dishes are definitely awesome too but I'm always hungry and the couscous gives me maximum portions with maximum flavor. I dump tons of the chili paste on it too which makes me sweat. The menu isn't pricey but definitely not your typical brunch dishes. The staff are awesome too!",1
"Don't do it, they said. ""You'll waste food"", they said. ""It's for parties of 9, but really we recommend it for 12-15"", they said. ""Let's do it anyway"", we said. 50 dishes. 8 people. Everything on the menu. The Whole Shebang. Killed it, we did. Then we had some cake. After going back again, I'd have to say that I still think that the food is good, but not amazing. I suppose now I can somewhat say that with authority as I've tried everything. Some 4-5 star worthy items, in order of preference: - Braised short rib with beet-Barbaresco spaghetti - Japanese grilled eggplant with feta and watercress - Lamb tagine - meat fell off the bone and the root vegetables, so delicious! - Fried goat cheese, lavender infused honey - Crispy brussels sprouts, apples were a great addition to this dish - Warm creamy polenta, not usually a fan, but always willing to give it a try in a different form, pleasantly surprised by this texture and preparation. - Housemade pizza - fontina cheese, crimini mushrooms, thin crust PS. I've attached a blurry menu.",1
"+1 for the quirky and fun decor (I especially liked the train set) +1 for the attentive waiters and busboys +1 for the unique and extensive menu +1 for the Daisy's Eggs, Coconut French Toast, Tortilla Soup +1 for the food coma that quickly set in... *yawn",1
"Nothing special for beef pho, too crowded on a Thursday they squished 3 groups on one table and you had to share . Surprised at 4 stars. cheap though !",1
"I absolutely adore this place. Â I've been coming here for years (since my sister attended Aveda nearby). Â It's perfect for lunch or dinner and you won't leave feeling guilty since the food is well priced, portions are generous and the food is rather healthy. I almost always get the salmon sandwich, which is absolutely delicious. Â A perfectly soft roll with a beautifully cooked salmon filet with dill mayo and a small salad. It's too yummy for words. I'm always part of the clean-plate club when I come here. Â  The salads are always delicious and fresh with lovely salad dressing. Â  Their jalapeno green sauce is amazing, I need to figure out how to make this at home. Â I could it with everything. So yeah, I LOVE this place.",1
"I was not expecting to be blown away by this casual place on one of the busiest corners in the city. Â Yet there I was, scarfing my whole fish, being blown away. Â We're always on the lookout for good, fresh Greek food. Â As simple as it is, we are often disappointed. Â This place was just the opposite. Â Very fresh, clean, delicious Greek seafood, and bombass lemon potatoes. Â Very reasonably priced for whole seafood. Â We absolutely will be returning.",1
Delicious artichoke pizza!!! It seems like forever for them to bring out the pizza but its totally worth it and thanks to Neha S. So i finally tried the margarita pizza and not a fan so stick to the artichoke slice,1
"AWESOME selection of foods and whiskeys. The negative is that seem to run out of the whiskeys. I picked 3 random ones that sounded cool, but they were all gone. I finally tried one bourbon that the bartender recommended which was okay. I tried another one on a whim and liked that one better. Big fan of the Michter's Single Batch Bourbon with 1 ice cube. The food here is great too. Big fan of the bone marrow. The Crispy Grits were good too, but the marrow satisfied my sin of gluttony. The corn muffin was tastier than it looked. For my entree, i tried the poached and crispy chicken. All of the pieces were boneless which were a plus. The ones that didn't have skin on them were a bit cold and bland. The ones with skin had a perfect crisp to the skin and a salty flavor that just season the meal to perfection. I destroyed the potato dumplings as well. Overall, I'm a big fan of this location, and i need to come back to eat and drink some more.",1
"Great experience at Up Thai this fall...so dare I say it but THUMBS UP! Made a reservation and arrived with 3/4ths of the party on time. Waiting for our additional guest was not a problem at all and even being 20 minutes tardy we sat within 5 in a completely packed dining room. The ambience is lovely--a lively vibe and beautiful rustic/shabby-chic decor! Most of our party went for the Up-Tini which was a favorite, they happily ordered many more! I opted for the Thai iced tea which was a solid representation of it. We started off with an order of pork crepe dumplings which were better than the average I've experienced at Thai restaurants but not necessarily worth ordering. We kept our entrees pretty basic with pad Thai and selections of curry. Everyone was more than satisfied with their dish and we all agreed we'd gladly return based on the food. The most outstanding part of the night had to be when we chose to linger at our table whilst ordering only one more round of drinks and not once were we rushed or made to feel uncomfortable by the staff. This was refreshing in a fairly crowded New York restaurant because so many times I've experienced the not-so-subtle check drop on the table as you are clearly finishing up your evening (aka rude). On that point alone I'd recommend this Up Thai for fantastic service. Eager to return to this place for drinks and Thai and another restaurant to add to Upper East Side's best.",1
"Really good place. I liked it how we sits in a bar-like area. Every dish is decorated nicely and delicious at the same time. I love their duck, and pork buns. They are amazing. Little peach on the door~",1
"I have always been skeptical of this place, but am so glad that I had finally decided to give this place a try. I am a Ho Fun Noodle Soup gal and boy their Beef Stew Noodle Soup was the bomb! The noodle was thick and soft. The broth was OMG Delicious. The beef was so tender. I ask for no bean sprouts. I finished my whole bowl and couldn't move or breathe. Their special duck was pretty amazing too!",1
"I must say that the ambiance at L'Artusi is appealing.. its busy, with everybody minding their own business and I really like that they have an open kitchen. Their concept of smaller sized pasta portions is perfect and it allows you to really try a bit of everything and share amongst friends. +++ (Must get) Charred Octopus Roasted Mushrooms ++ (Very good) Spaghetti with garlic and chillies Dayboat Scallops The Olive Cake definitely does live up the hype and is a must so save room for it!",1
"Great place to go with friends, cheap, spacious. The margarita pizza is incredible, very quality ingredients.",1
"Born and raised New Yorker, I love my thin crust. My friend suggested I try their grandma slices here and now I'm in LOVE! The slice was crispy on the bottom with a soft bouncy dough texture topped with the most flavorful sauce. My only complaint is there wasn't enough cheese but that's bc I love cheese more than the average person. We also got 4 rice balls, two prosciutto and two of their special balls. I am drooling thinking about this meal. Words do not do this slice justice. You have to come and check it out for yourself.",1
"If I could get a table, I would eat at Maialino everyday. We started off with some salumi: proscuitto di parma and soppressata picante. Decent quality stuff, not bad. The best part of Maialino is the pastas. The Malfatti al Maialino is delicious...one of the best pastas I've ever had. The sauce was slightly lemony, giving it a mild, but good acidic tang to it, while the pork on top of the pasta was tender and flavorful. The Tonnarelli Cacio & Pepe was so peppery, but so good. We couldn't come to Maialino without getting the namesake dish, Maialino Al Forno. Enough to fill 2-3 people for an entree, it was good, but not great. The pork was flavorful (as well as the potatoes under), but was a bit on the dry side for my taste. Still, not bad at all. For dessert I got the affogato. Really good stuff: a shot of very strong espresso poured over a scoop of creamy vanilla gelato. Good ratio of espresso to gelato. Perfect way to end a great meal. Service was casual, but friendly and efficient. Knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive...typical of a Danny Meyer place. If I was able to come back, I'd definitely order those pastas and try a couple more, maybe skip out on the Maialino Al Forno (but it is worth at least trying for the first time without any disappointments). And I'd definitely come back.",1
"The line is too long. The place is too small. The ramen is very good. Their main broth is a chicken broth, similar to ShÅyu ramen, but heavier on chicken flavor rather than soy sauce. The Miso ramen is what I like best here. This isn't the best ramen in the city, but it's up there. _____",1
"I lived in Mexico for a year, and I can safely say that the food I've had at Taqueria is the closest it gets. It's the best Mexican I've had in the US, and I say that after having lived in both LA and NYC for several years. The pork tacos and chips and guac can't be beat. The service isn't overly friendly, but they're quick and they get the job done.",1
I have been craving a good gyro since i moved to NY.Finally Mamagyro delivers!!! Â Great fresh food and the staff are super friendly. Â I don't know if the the 2 young ladies out front are owners but they act like it. Â  I will make the trip back up the east side next time I want a gyro.,1
"Still my FAVORITE brunch place ever from all the places I've had in NY! Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything from here. Clinton does everything so perfectly. I usually don't like getting pancakes, but this place actually always have me in the mood to order them because their pancakes are so heavenly. Fluffy and airy with their awesome maple syrup. Benedict's are on a warm buttery flakey biscuit. Sugar cured bacon is AMAZING here, I'm even droooling thinking about it! Since I'm more of a waffle lover than a pancake lover, I remember they use to have this wonderful fluffy waffle with fresh berries and ice cream... But I don't see it on the menu anymore WHYY?! ;( I usually prefer coming here on the weekdays around 1ish where it's only half an hour wait. The weekends will always be an hour to two hours wait so eat a small snack/breakfast beforehand and walk around soho because the wait is worth it! LOVEE CLINTON ST BAKING CO.",1
"If you want me to talk about your restaurant and make me excited to give it fivesies on yelp all you need to do is serve Sapporo on tap and have at least two menu items that sound gross/weird but taste like **makes obnoxious mmm noise** and a small cozy clean ambiance won't hurt either. I love you Hakata and your Ton Tons. We ordered the hot pot yes with the pigs feet and we felt so cool as we stirred everything together. It was delicious, its soup so its warming, the pigs feet are just sexy. But I just want you to put one thing in your back pocket and that is calves liver sashimi. We ordered another dish of this to go AND WE ATE IT OFF OF EACHOTHERS FACES WHEN WE GOT HOME. No my husband took it with him for lunch the next day.. I really enjoyed this place and as I explore more and more Japanese food I am more and more convinced that their food is the *best*. I will be back to try all the other items mentioned here.",1
"Unfortunately, this place went downhill in regards to the food. Â The oysters were good, but the cooked food really did not cut it this time. Â  The fettuccine with clams was not very flavorful this time. Â I remember the first couple times I had it, I would get an orgasmic taste in my mouth but this time it was underwhelming. Â We also ordered a fish dish which was also really bland. Â  The pros of this place is the assortment of oysters and their complementary rum cake at the end which is still delicious; however cooked items were sub par. Â Service is definitely a plus; however I don't think this place is worth the wait :(",1
"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is very delicious, well thought-out, and obviously made with care. Prices are well worth the quality, atmosphere, and excellent service. I've been here twice with groups and sampled quite a few dishes - every bite was excellent. The Sunday Supper prix fixe is a great deal!",1
"I've been living in the East Williamsburg hood and have passed Testo several times. The menu is comprised of very affordable homemade Italian dishes and the location is perfect for a small cozy neighborhood restaurant and they finally have a beer/ wine selection! My gf and I decided to try walk in service on NYE. They were all booked up w reservations but the owner was very accommodating and let us sit at the bar (main reason for the 4 stars). We started with the spinach salad special. It was a delicious simple salad w spinach & fruit ( pears & berries) with a light oil dressing. Very tasty, nothing too over the top. For entrees my gf ordered the Spicy pasta w half lobster for $15. The dish was delicious, steaming hot half lobster in the shell with homemade spaghetti and a spicy fra diavolo sauce, A fantastic dishl for the price. I ordered the butternut squash tortelli for 8$. Another extremely affordable and delicious dish prepared with homemade tortelli and a butter cream sauce that was to die for. Along with dinner we had a half caraff of house red for 14$ and for dessert the Panacotta, which left something to be desired but was still enjoyable. All in all we enjoyed our experience at Testo and was happy to find out they are the same owners of another of our favorite local eateries, Il Passatore. The owner was very accommodating and the environment felt right out of an Italian neighborhood bistro. We will be trying Testo again in the future.",1
"Came in to what looked like a full house and were taken upstairs to be seated. The upstairs seating area was nice with big windows and high ceilings. For dinner I tried the lamb shank, calf liver, skir steak. Food was all very well cooked and seasoned. Good sized portions and reasonably priced. I would definitely come back here for the atmosphere and unique food.",1
"Almost everything about this place is good. The little bar in the front is good if you have a short wait and the lighting is good. I can't remember what music was playing at all but overall this little Cuban spot left a good impression. The churrasco was good. It wasn't the best but good ,and that entree easily fed 2 people. The paella was good & huge too. I especially liked that they added chicken & sausage with the usual seafood. Nothing that I had was stellar. Nothing was exquisite. There's no reason I'd ever plan to come back, but I wouldn't avoid the place either.",1
"This place is committed to keeping the easy-going southern vibe that makes the chicken taste better, despite being situated in Harlem. We came on a slow Saturday morning and waited 20 minutes with our party of 5. I was overjoyed when they brought out cornbread for our table...those didn't stand a chance in front of a famished me. We ordered the Al Sharpton, your standard chicken and waffles. Amy Ruth's prepares both their waffles and fried chicken a little teeny bit sweet, which is what makes them so mouth-watering! Those waffles, man...those waffles (it's love, man...it's love) The smother sauce AKA gravy should be ordered on the side so that you can enjoy your chicken and waffles sometimes savory (smother sauce), or sometimes sweet (syrup!!) When it comes to sides, I would stick with classics like mac&cheese, collard greens, and buttered corn. Didn't like the hollandaise-drenched cole slaw so much because I had been hoping it would actually taste like vegetables, but I guess that's wishful thinking when I'm at a fried chicken joint.",1
"A lot of pizza places in NYC. Â This is tops because the pizza is great (don't believe me, look at the pictures), the price is right (20 bucks for a pie big enough to split), and the wait isn't too bad. Â Bring a buddy and buy a couple brews; you'll have a great f*@king time.",1
"Barrio Chino on Cinco de Mayo.. sounds like a no-brainer, right? After reading all of the positive reviews on this place, I have to say that I was just a liiiittle disappointed with the actual experience. And why's that? Well, the tacos just did not do it for me, and that's a serious strike out in my book. ~The Taco~ The glorious, holy taco. The ubiquitous taco, the back bone of Mexican cuisine... The simplicity of a taco with well-seasoned meat nestled inside two corn tortillas makes it by far my favorite food on the planet. And yet - the Al Pastor at Barrio Chino was a let down. The filling of marinated pork with pineapple, while not ""bad,"" was not nearly good enough to savor by itself. And the corn tortillas were not even doubled-up (as a true taco should be)! My taco obsession aside... the jalapeno (or was it habanero?) margarita was good and spicy, just the way I like it. But the regular margs were wayyy too salty, even past the point of drinking. They tasted like seawater. Needless to say, we sent them back to the bar (twice!). The one bite I had of my boyfriend's mole enchilada WAS amazing though, so I'd be willing to come back. I'll just be sure to stay away from the tacos next time.",1
"I used to come to SriPraPhai a lot, maybe 2-3 times a year since my college days, especially since it is in my neighborhood. However, I stopped coming as of 2 years ago for my own personal reasons. I do remember this place having really good soft shell crabs. They were the most delicious appetizers. And I have ordered the wide flat noodles here as well as fish and other items with my friends and family. The food is pretty good and I would say it's authentic. Since I'm not Thai I can't really say for sure. It has a good amount of seating area. I don't think this place takes reservations so it's a first come first serve basis. There is a nice open garden type seating area in the back. However, you can always hear the 7 train passing by when you're trying to talk to your friends. It is a nice seating area though.",1
"Great atmosphere, definitely where all the young and hipster New Yorkers go for a Sunday brunch. Food was good. I thought it was a little overpriced, however. The kale salad is good in that it is a plain salad (my friend added eggs to her; the yolk and kale tasted delicious together). The corned beef hash was very tasty. My friend had the french toast - also flavorful. Overall a great experience. You should eat here if you haven't yet! I just expect a little more for the price.",1
"Favorite new happy hour wine bar. I made reservations from opentable, afraid that I would not be able to grab a seat during happy hour. Once you walk in, the atmosphere is so romantic and sultry. I came here with two girlfriends and were gonna take part in the $10 for 3 flights during happy hour (5-7pm). But the selection was limited only to 6 wines. I checked into foursquare and there was a deal for a free appetizer (pistachio crusted goat cheese or escargot) with a bottle of wine..so we Â opted for a bottle of pinot noir. The wine was so good. We shared a massive plate of charcuterie, baked medjool dates stuffed stuffed with bleu d'auvergne cheese wrapped with prosciutto and diced pear, and warm pistachio Â crusted goat cheese ball with honey, confiture d'oignons and toasts. Everything was so good, I really loved the goat cheese ball..so creamy. I want to come back and try their other menu items. Service was so good..my friend was going to pour herself some wine and the waitress came rushing over to do it. She kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and frequently refilled our waters/bread basket. I think everyone that works here is French cause they have that awesome accent. Parking-wise, there's meters along 8th street but if you park a block away on 9th street there's free parking during certain times.",1
"My friends and I decided to go on a Monday and taste the menu and wines. Everything was stellar. Service was outstanding, bread and chives, butter, pours, fish, lobster, sweets , saltys, everything was delicious. Had a tasting menu before, never as memorable as such. The staff was friendly and our server Andrew, I believe, was fantastic. Also the manager on floor was a doll. She talked to us about wine, recommendations, and treated us very well. Service, food, booze.. Five stars.",1
"Our wait was almost 90 minutes on a weekday night. Luckily, there were many places around for us to get a drink during this time. We left our name/number to the hostess and received a text to come back when our seats were ready. Service was very friendly and despite the swarms of people outside waiting, you don't feel rushed at all. The dining area is clearly separated from the bar/waiting area, big thumbs up from me!! I hate it when all the commotion is going on right behind my back while I eat. Eating at ippudo is a guaranteed wait, but it's so worthwhile. The pork buns were spot on! Definitely a must order for everyone. We got the chicken wings because we saw everyone else nearby ordering it. I gotta say they were very tasty, but not memorable....At $7 for 4 wings, I'll pass. We ordered the spicy Karaka ramen and it was delishhhh. Everything you expect from superb ramen can be found in this bowl. Tender noodles with the right chew, flavorful broth, and great balance of garnish ingredients. Can't wait to try the Akamaru next!",1
lamb and chicken combo all day - all night.,1
"Really good and priced ok (like $4/taco), a little more than I usually pay for tacos, but definitely a unique taste and an experience. My only deal is there's nowhere to sit.",1
"It's been awhile since I had some good pizza. I love brick oven thin crust - although it can get a little too chard it is still delicious. So silly me I ordered Cesar salad - classic but ""boring"" and it disappeared so quickly I was only able to get just a bite. I was so sad. It was fresh crunchy delicious and nothing was overpowering. We ordered the artichoke and arugula salads as well but there was something fresh and crisp and flavorful. I know, it's a pizza joint, but freshest tastiest salads I have ever had. Order some. We had the arugula pizza...thin, crunchy, delicious pizza and this is from a person who prefers other types of food over pizza.",1
"Foie gras - just wow, what a combination of exceptional flavors I also had the oxtail terrine, duck, and Korean BBQ wraps which were all delicious. Â This is a great date spot as you will win your date's heart with bacon. Â Bacon fat covered popcorn! Accents of bacon with foie gras dusted atop this sweet, savory delight! Â I mean, if you're going to go to Sunnyside, this would be the only reason to go.",1
"*Note: Â The address can be misleading. Â It is actually on the corner of rivington and chrystie, not at 177 chrystie (which would lead you to the side door of their kitchen). Service: Superb service. Â The staff here is very pleasant. Â They were very helpful with the menu and took their time to explain the dishes to us. Â They were also very good with refilling our wine glasses. Â I believe the owner also came to greet us. Ambiance: Â It was a relaxing setting, red checkered table clothes and cute little lamps. Â They also have cozy table booths. Â  Food: Â The portions are very generous. -Parpadelle with sausage and fennel was delicious!! The texture of the pasta was perfect. -Spaghetti with Manila Clams- good amount of clams and the pasta -Chicken Mushroom Marsala -the chicken was a bit dry but the mushrooms were tasty -Parma Pizza- very good portion- crispy crust- sauce was not too flavorful -Seafood Salad- good portion- but I did not think it was anything special, lots of lime juice, chopped up seafood lots of radicchio leaves. Overall: Good portions, fair prices, nice ambiance and wonderful staff. Â I would come back!!",1
Pretty decent Italian food for an all cash place. The fried Calamari was very tasty and crisp; well executed. The people I dined with enjoyed their soups and pasta dishes and the price was reasonable.,1
Decor is nice. Complimentary biscuits and such were good. What I ordered (turkish eggs) was not as impressive. Meh.,1
"This place was packed. It is pretty big. Â There is a bar, restaurant and whiskey room. I didn't care for the crab sliders. Â The beef sliders and lamb meatballs were good. The music was good. The service could have been better. We had a small room to the side of the bar. Â It was excellent. I was surprised to learn that we didn't have to pay a deposit to reserve it and there wasn't a food or beverage requirement. This is a nice after work spot.",1
"OMG OMG OMG 2 bottles of sake, about 15 dishes of Izakaya type food and 4 people drunk walking home with the designated subway walker. Â The food is everything you read on Yelp. Â The hardest part is finding the little stairwell down to the bar.",1
"The perfect cozy French cafe tucked away in Chelsea. We happened upon this place for dinner while in town for the weekend and it was one of our favorites. Highly recommend the saffron mussels, chicken risotto, & lavender creme brulee (I know there are french translations for these, but you can figure it out). I can't imagine this being a good place for a group bigger than 4-6 but for a two person dinner it was perfect. Also after 1.5 hours of soothing French music, the wait staff decided it was time to switch to the new Beyonce album - always a good decision in my book.",1
Burrito's are very good. Â There are even soy and tofu options. HOWEVER do not get the nachos....they use processed melted cheese from like Taco Bell....not shredded and then melted.,1
"Seriously giving this place 5stars from ONE item on the menu= THE MAC&CHEESE TRIO!!!! We came here a while back after coming out of the club. The wait wasn't too bad. We waited about 15min and was seated upstairs. Like others said there is a bar, also lighting is dim, and not too much space. Along with the trio I got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. It was good but not the best. Actually a big portion which is good but that trio is what keeps mouth salivating all this time later! EVERYONE should try this trio just once. It will not dissapoint at all! I would def try other itmes on the menu or for brunch like others raved about. MAC&CHEESE DONE RIGHT! This is a good thing there is not one located in Queens or I would be the size of a Good Year blimp. Why are you still reading this? Get your A$$ over there and EAT!!! ; )",1
I had the veal meatballs as an appetizer and they were delicious. The salmon with spinach was OK.,1
Just fries. Nothing that special. My friends always get Pomme Frites when they are drunk but I'd prefer a falafel.,1
"For hooking me up with a view of flowers while I wait, I guess that's cool. For hooking me up with free food while I wait, that's definitely cool. Strawberries? Don't mind if I do, sir.. Coffee? Yes, please. This is about the only place I'll order an egg cream or a cherry lime rickey from, but I couldn't tell you why. It just feels right somehow. This place just feels right. It's like it got warped here after an episode of ""Leave it to Beaver"" or something. Sure, as other reviews have pointed out, at the end of the day it is JUST diner food. However, it's diner food done better than almost anyone else. As far as the service is concerned, while you won't get free food for waiting in the south (most times), you will get the same kind of attentive service, though it will probably be from a meth-addled old white lady at Waffle House at 3am as opposed to these guys, who will cut up with you and laugh at your ridiculous jokes. However, this is NYC, and I have yet to see anywhere else here that gives this level of service without having the decimal point shifted one place to the right by the end of the meal.",1
Love the rose water lemonade. Food is pretty good. Cute and warm ambiance. One of our favorite places to eat in Brooklyn. Good for dates and small gatherings.,1
"We went there on the day of German vs. Argentina game. I was craving for the waffles, but when we got there it was sold out. The waiter joked that because all the Germans came that morning and finished all the waffles. So me and my friend ordered the skillet omelet and pancakes, and they were quite delicious. Especially the pancakes with their maple syrup, one of the best I had since last time I was in Maine.",1
"Oh my heavens, the spinach gnocchi was a delight. Very soft, chewy, and love the creamy gorgonzola sauce. End the night with their chocolate mousse and was utterly sad when I saw the bottom of the bowl. Had a great time eating outside on a sunny day. Only wish they accept credit cards.",1
LOVE love love Verlaines - have been here multiple times! I am actually a little obsessed with their Lychee martinis! And for the price you cant go wrong. Have tried a few of the apps and cant go wrong in that department either. I always get the fried calamari (the sauce is amazing!!) and the shrimp tempura.,1
"Had an L size Kamo Seiro (duck meat served in a hot broth with cold soba noodles on the side). It was alright. The taste wasn't really memorable and I'm not sure if I was just particularly hungry that night or what, but I was still hungry after. I've had better but I might be a little spoiled from having lived in Japan. For $20 this dish didn't really seem worth it. I do like the variety on the menu and wouldn't be opposed to coming back and sampling other items. The Early Bird special seems like a good deal.",1
-Last time I will go there -Food is okay -Burger was okay though I prefer a shake shack burger over it -It seems they largely treat regulars/celebrities/exceptionally well dressed people well -My actual waitress was nice but I didn't care for the hostess ,1
"Occasion: Friday dinner for Restaurant Week (A) Food (4.0 out of 5): What we ate: 1) Stake Tartar - Unique, rich flavor, well complemented with hot pepper and onion 2) Falafel - Very crispy (almost hard) but soft inside - if you're used to traditional falafel, we may skip this dish as appetizer! 3) Moujadara - sweet, full of rich texture 4) Hommus - my favorite!! Must!! Served with warm (feels like just baked out of oven), fresh pita bread (funny - we even ended up asking for more bread with big big smile!) As main dish, we had 1) lamb chop (super tender, good quality meat with sauteed green sauce), and 2) vegetarian risotto (a bit disappointing part of our dinner, a bit too salty and the sauce was a bit blend, would recommend trying out other dishes) Drum rolls, please. For our dessert, we got 1) candy bar, and 2) sweet cheese tart (would recommend this, don't worry, it's not too cheesy and the best part of this dessert is, orange blossom syrup! also very big portion so expect to bring something back home!!) (B) Ambience (4.0 out of 5): We were seated in a side room full of couples - enough space between each table (I even ran into another friendly couple sitting next to us, ended up sharing my review/recommendation on the dessert menu.) It feels quite cozy but romantic with the high ceiling, and dim lighting. The whole restaurant is very spacious, great for both group, bar scene and romantic dinner for couples! Â  (C) Service (4.0 out of 5): Our waiter was nice, considerate - well-informed about the menu. The food came in a timely manner and careful to details. He also had a great recommendation for us (without much experience in Lebanese food) (D) Value (3 out of 5): Decent value for $$ (wish they have more signature dishes on their restaurant week menu)",1
"I've had bahn mi before and I was never much of a fan...I always thought the cilantro and cucumber were too overpowering. Â The hubby visited JoJu a few months back and it was all he could talk about. Â Of course I had to see for myself, but I was still skeptical. Â In my head I thought we'd arrive to some dark hole in the wall place, that didn't have much appeal, but I was wrong. Â The space is quite welcoming and modern. Â Kind of cute actually. Â The girl behind the register was very friendly. Â We opted for 2 sandwiches and a Vietnamese iced coffee. The coffee they use is Cafe Du Monde from New Orleans and I love it, paired with the condensed milk, it is a sweet refreshing treat and actually works really well with offsetting the heat of the sandwiches, which we ordered spicy. Â Speaking of the sandwiches we opted for the BBQ Pork and the Beef Bulgogi. Â The spicy version of any sandwich uses sliced jalapenos and spicy mayo, I'd say go for spicy. The bread was pretty awesome, chewy and crusty with just the right amount of toast on it, it's the perfect vehicle for the yumminess that is inside. Â Both sandwiches, I'll admit, were amazing! Â I was so surprised how much I liked (loved) them, there was the perfect ratio of meat to cucumber to cilantro to pickled daikon and carrots. Â It hits all the levels of flavors you could want...spice, tang, sweet and let's not forget textures. I had wrongly accused banh mi in the past, but JoJu has made me quite the fan.",1
"Pure Thai Cookhouse was delicious. I got the Wok Cashew Shrimp and it was as tasteful as it was utterly satisfying. The service was incredibly prompt for how busy it was, even on a Sunday night. Be warned that the place isn't large and its popularity gives way to a pretty hopping restaurant. It can be crowded, especially for semi-large groups. Even so, the wait wasn't nearly as long as I imagined it would be. Overall, great service, great atmosphere, and even better food. Will definitely be going back!",1
"Came here with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night. Very nice venue and lively atmosphere..we were lucky and got a table right away, as my friend informed me there could be waits of up to 1-2 hours on some nights. Ordered: Sheep milk ricotta, which was creamy and perfectly seasoned. Â As others pointed out, a well deserved must-try. Â Needed more crusty bread tho to slather on the cheese (or was it my fault for not laying it on thick enough, hmmm). Â Luckily, the house made focaccia saved the day. Burrata, which was also well presented with the right amount of oils and marinated peppers to balance the bitters of the greens. Â Good, but nothing overly exciting. Pappardelle with ground lamb ragu - pasta was very fresh, you can tell it was made on the premises moments ago. Â Sauce was good too with the right amount of seasoning and complimented the pasta nicely. Gnocci with mushrooms and cheese (special of the day) - WOW WA WEE WOW! I got goosebumps with every bite I took...very rich in flavor, and again freshly made. With the exception of the crostini meant to be shared, the portions were perfect individual sizes. Â 2 people can split 2 antipasti plus their own pasta dish and feel perfectly full. (Note: didn't see the portion sizes for the meats and fish, so can't vouch for those) Our waitress was friendly, attentive and answered all questions, staff was on point and courteous. All in all a wonderful meal! Â Only cons I can see are; Tight table spaces; If you have food restrictions (i.e., no pork), you'll be limited with the menu items; and Â Prices are on par with other TriBeCa establishments so don't expect a cheap meal",1
This past Friday night the host had no problem seating all the cute girls ahead of me and my husband despite our names being higher on the list. Â When asked about it the host said he called our name 3 times. Â Hard to believe that we didn't hear him being that we were standing at the very front of this restaurant the whole time. Â It takes us a lot to question let alone complain about the processes if a restaurant but this experience was so over the top horrible that I feel it my obligation to report....,1
"Three and a half years later, I'm back at Clinton St. The last time I has here I had their infamous blueberry pancakes. I didn't want to order them again so I chose the VANILLA BUTTERMILK WAFFLE WITH BERRIES, MINT WHIPPED CREAM, AND PASSION FRUIT SAUCE. A special listed on the 4th of July, 2013. Verdict? DON'T ORDER THE SPECIAL. Anthony Bourdain would be utterly disappointed in me having order the special. I just wanted to try something new and it bit me in the bud. Totally unrefined like their blueberry pancakes. It was rather quite sweet. The berries were fresh, the mint whipped cream was delicious, but in all honesty, it didn't really work. And to top it all off, I was sitting along side the booth wall and A/C water condensation was dripping from the ceiling. It' didn't bug me too much at first, but by the time my food came, I was nearly done. I don't think I'll be back for a while Clinton St., sorry.",1
Best chocolate shake I've ever had!,1
"I'm a Japanese food lover. I felt I came back to Japan for few hours. The place is amazing at the bar or at the table. Everything is perfect. Just amazing FRESH food and EXCELLENT service. Surely, one of the best Japanese place and best experience in Manhattan and anywhere else. The giant prawn is one of the best one I ever tasted. The Sashimi was fresh and perfectly sliced. The fish is grilled just at it needs to be. The show at the bar is just awesome. The staff at the entrance, mainly ladies are well dressed and very welcoming. The Uni for the appetizer is excellent. Everything I took was also incredibly fresh and I felt I was returning to Kyoto, Tokyo... Always remember to come early or try to make a reservation if you are a regular customer. Always try to taste one fish well prepared, it's one amazing experience. This type of place is perfect from A to Z. I came back many time and I'm always leaving with a big smile and thinking the next time I will return. One of the best gem of Manhattan.",1
"the only GREAT bar in the bushwick area, in my opinion. love the elegant yet playful speakeasy vibe this place has going on, & the bartenders are always really cool.",1
"This place is tiny to say the least, the staff is friendly and nice, no questions about that. I'm sure the waitress gets hits on a ton by white guys who took a japanese class and have a raging fetish. I had the pork and chicken broth ramen, it was unremarkable. Perhaps there were too many flavors involved. I didn't enjoy the broth, but the ramen and everything else was quite good. They had fresh veggies it seams and a slice of seaweed for you. Â the gyoza were fried, to almost a blacken state, but still very good. Its pretty good, but not out of this world. hopefully the next trip there will fare better.",1
I am still dreaming of those fluffy little pillows or gnocchi...heaven.,1
If you want fast-food Korean. Here it is. Came here for some easy take-out Korean food. I would definitely take the hot lunch/dinner buffet option over the pre-packed food though. =),1
"I wrote this review previously at the other location. It was for this new location they moved to. ~~~~~~~ While dining at Pok Pok might score you some points with the hipster crowd, I was not impressed. Decor was pleasant and cozy with a minimalistic approach. Bar in the front with some window / side seating. Kitchen in the middle then more seating towards the back where we were. Â Bathroom were clean which is a total plus. On the menu for us was Kai Yaang Tua (Charcoal roasted label Rouge hen stuffed with lemongrass, Garlic, Pepper and cilantro) Ike's Vietnamese fish Sauce Wings Khao soi kai ( northern thai mild curry noodle soup ) The Kai Yaang was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin outside and a moist inside. Other than technique of cooking, it lacks flavor which is probably why it comes with a sweet chili sauce and a tamarind based dipping sauce. Â To consider it a specialty of the house would be an understatement, especially at 21 dollars an order. We also had 2 orders of jasmine rice to go with the hen. Some parts of the rice were hard which could of meant that it was either sitting there for a long time or it wasn't cooked with enough water. Next up is the fish sauce wings. Unlike the Kai Yaang, this has all flavor but barely enough meat. The combination of sweet and savory/pugent is delightfully addicting but leaves your tummy screaming for more. They must of used anorexic chicken wings cause all of our wings were skinny as hell. Â 15 dollars an order. Last was the curry noodle soup which in my opinion was my least favorite. When they say ""soup"", that's literally what it is. The ""curry"" is water-like with a beginning nuisance of curry flavor followed by the finish of sweet coconut milk . Maybe I'm just use to a thicker consistency when ordering a curry noodle soup especially from Malaysian establishments. 16 dollars an order. Beverage for the night was a Hakushu 12yr Japanese whiskey neat. Less than a 2 count for 13 dollars. Â  Overall it's not a bad place with enough on the menu to keep you coming back. It's just not worth the price in what you're getting IMHO. 2/12 stars",1
"I don't know why I let the idea of Terroir intimidate me for so long--when I finally went to the Tribeca location, I found friendly service, great selection, and an almost-unbelievable happy hour menu. $6 for glasses of well-curated wine, and $4 for bar snacks? I'm going to have to start keeping a mental map of all the Terroirs in NYC.",1
"Roberta's, how I love you and your bee sting pizza. I would eat here everyday if it was closer. Love everything about the menu, which is focused on freshness and seasonal produce.",1
"The only reason this place is getting 3 stars is because it is so small. Â Like I actually laughed it was so small and the food is great so the small tight space is always packed when I go. Â  The place is also pretty loud, which makes it best for small groups. I have only ever gone with one other person. Food is cheap, but very fresh, and good quality. The margaritas are strong and the servers are very attentive.",1
"Finally had a chance to stop by. Â I was surprised that we didn't need a reservation given the popularity of other Momofuku establishments. Â Still pretty crowded when we walked in on a Thursday night, but we were seated immediately at the bar. We started with drinks - they have a seasonal drink menu so I went with the Viva la Vida; not too sweet and pretty tasty and my friend went with the classic Penicillin. We decided to start off with the country ham plate which is similar to a anti-pasti cured meat plate that you might see in Italian restaurants. Â Pretty generous portions of thinly sliced ham, much like a prosciutto or Spanish ham, served with warm toast and a reddish brown mayonnaise mustard-like spread. Â  We then had the veal sweetbread served with asian pear -- definitely my favorite of the night. Â The soft, buttery sweetbread had a hint of gaminess, which I personally enjoy, paired with the sweet, crisp pear was a great balance. Â  Of the three dishes, the flat iron steak was the most disappointing. Â We ordered it medium rare and it came to our table nearly rare to raw. Â We had a bite anyway just to give it a chance, but we had to send it back since it was virtually flavorless and raw. Â Unfortunately, since it was already sliced, the reheating process just couldn't produce the same results as if it had been cooked in one piece. Â All in all, not a well-produced dish. Â Even if it had been cooked properly, it wasn't anything to write home about. Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu, but the first visit was a fair experience overall.",1
"Park Slope-quality food (with accompanying prices, yes), decent beer selection, and generously poured juice glasses full of house wine. Â  Baby spinach salad, quatro stagioni pizza, and strawberries w/ lemon sugar and vanilla gelato, all delish (and the perfect amount of food for 2). Â And TVs, 4 big fat TVs upon which to watch sports while you eat yummy pizza and drink much, close to home. Â Yay! I'm also looking forward to trying their 11pm-1am happy hour.",1
Vanilla bean French toast is best thing I've ever put in my mouth! Had a great hamburger and fries as well,1
"Mike, that kid is such a Scratcher. Maybe, calling someone a scatcher as in insult is just a Wisconsin thing, I haven't heard that around here but when I found out there was a bar actually called *Scatcher* I was instantly all ears. Really not a fan of NYU-area bars (Voted no on Proposition crusty-staff McSorelly's) but was in the neighborhood so thought I'd give it a go. Â The place wasn't fantastic but it was a step up from those nearby. Â  Â  First off, it's amazingly spacious! And for a weekend night it wasn't overly crowded. Â I think having Bowery on the one-side actually cuts down on traffic. Â The drink selection isn't anything crazy, I don't recall seeing a specials or cheap beer option but alright alright when there's actually a table that counts for a lot. So besides the fact that I love the name, the bar is big, seemingly not often crowded its a good place for a few friends to meet up. Â It truly is just a very straightforward B-A-R.",1
"I am hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food is really good. The service once you are seated is good. My question is, why the long waits?! They don't take reservations, but they do take names at the door (your party has to be entirely there to be seated). They don't really know how to manage their guests. Our team leader asked to put his name on the list, left his phone number, and we all stood outside with a promise of only a 30 minute wait. After about 20 minutes, and watching a few parties go ahead of us, we ask team leader to check on the wait. They somehow lost track of him entirely! So to apologize, the hostess said we were the next party, and that the party in the corner by the window already has the bill. This place is totally bumpin', and the hostess does nothing to rush them along -- no, ""do you need anything else?"" or ""you're not ready yet?"" To make matters worse, the party noticed us eyeing their table and decided to mock us by staring right at us while picking their food as obviously as they could! I have been asked to be polite if possible and allow other guests to be seated at other places when their place is packed. There is no sense of time management here. How can they give good estimates of proper wait times when they let people just hang out forever?! The hostess did notice our growing grumpiness and brought us some ice pops -- and they were indeed good. That aside, the food IS good (not sure if it hour + wait good -- yes, by the time we were seated that is what was quoted). The service is good (a little too friendly for my taste, but other people would TOTALLY enjoy it). The environs is much too dark -- I do like to see my food. I would go again, but not at the waits they quote!",1
"To be honest, I was pretty disappointed by the ramen at Ippudo. Prior to my visit, I heard lots of amazing things about ippudo and the great reviews on yelp only made my expectations higher. The ramen was definitely not worth the 1.5 hour wait at 9 PM or the price. The reason I gave this an ""ok"" rating is for this place is for the pork buns! FOOD: As I mentioned before, the ramen wasn't all that good. I ordered the very popular Akamaru Modern with egg and pork (~$19) while my friend ordered the special that's being offered from june-october -- Scratch Tan Tan Men ($17 without add-ons). I think the ramen is way too pricey for its taste. I had very high expectations and was pretty disappointed. The taste was just average. Shin Sen Gumi (in southern California) is definitely substantially better tasting and MUCH cheaper. The pork buns were what prevented me from considering the 1.5 hr wait a complete waste of my time. It was full of flavor and MUCH better than any pork buns I had ever tried before. I definitely recommend the pork buns -- they're a must order item if you decide to check this place out! SERVICE: The service was great. All the workers were very friendly and our food came out pretty quickly. Overall, I think this place is very overhyped and overrated and I'm sure I wouldn't be willing to wait that long for their ramen. But I would definitely come back for their pork buns if the wait isn't too long. Ippudo is one of those places I would just check out once to check it off my list of ""must-eats"" in NYC just because it is so popular, but I wouldn't come here regularly.",1
"I really love this bar and Mayor and Claus are very nice & friendly. I have been coming here about 2 years, but I gave to say that the last time I went I was disappointed. The brunette woman that was bartending was very abrasive and seemed put out over getting us drinks. She also kept slamming our drinks and plates down...I just didn't appreciate it. I didn't want to rate it badly because I've had so many good experiences here, but if this was my first time I wouldn't have come back.",1
"The pancakes are orgasmic - not to be crude, but that really is the best way to describe the pancakes. Â Brunch here was one of the best meals that I have ever had, and I generally don't like American breakfast foods - that's how good it was. They taste a bit different, and better than anything that I've had. Â The pancakes are incredibly light and buttery/milky, and the the maple syrup adds just the right touch of sweetness to help the ensemble melt in your mouth. Â Also, the hash browns are amazing. Â The are crisp on one side and the crunchiness adds to the appeal. The portions are so big that my wife and I (two very big eaters) could not finish our two breakfasts (the southern breakfast and pancakes). We got really lucky and had a 15 minute wait, but I hear that the average weekend wait if 1 1/2 - 2 hours, which is crazy. Â I'd love to go back there again for breakfast/brunch, but not sure that I would try given the wait.",1
"Can't believe it took me almost a year to return to Contra, when it happened to be my birthday. Â Not surprisingly, I was a very happy birthday girl; yet surprisingly, the food was even better than I remembered! Without further ado, let's straight to my bday dinner, shall we :) First course, kohlrabi salad with hazelnut milk, pear. I don't recall I have had fresh kohlrabi before - it is not a common veggie in Hong Kong where I am from; it is mostly found in Yunan province and usually fermented. So this is brand new to me. The thinly sliced cylindrical veggie has very mild taste and crunchy texture. It serves as a perfect vehicle to absorb the hazelnut milk dressing. It is a good starter, light and clean taste, just enough to open up your appetite. Second course, seared monkish in horseradish foam dusted over dried seaweed. I love monkfish. It is perfectly cooked, great texture and paired well with the seasoning. I would recommend pairing with champagne or other dry white wine as the horseradish foam has a whipped cheese like salty taste but without the heavy-cheesiness. Third course, strip loin with purple cabbage, Â swiss chard in an anchovy dressing. It's a chunk of sexy beef, perfectly charred outside and medium rare, juicy inside. Dessert! First act, coffee parfait con passion fruit cream. It is not bad; I just had difficulty to pair them together. If I could, I would just have two scoops of the coffee parfait. This is so creamy so coffee-y. Second dessert, popcorn mousse with mandarin ice and popcorn sugar. This is to die for ! I usually can't finish any dessert but this is an exception - more savory than sweet, great contrary of texture and salty-sweet taste. Perfect to finish up with a dripped coffee made with Colombian coffee beans from a local Brooklyn roaster. Overall, very good food, even better services. Jen, the bar tender, makes killer cocktails. And she has a great personality. The vibe was eccentric and vibrant. . Â When I got there around 7, it was about 70% full, by 9pm, it was at full swing. But it never got too loud, which I appreciate. If you like me eating out frequently, you should know that for this quality of food and creative tasting menu, with wine pairing, it easily goes beyond $120/pp in NYC. Yet it is only $55 to start at Contra (drinks are $15ish for wine/cocktails)! Â I shall def come back more often :) Happy New Year!",1
"Delicious! Â And sweet and cute! I went here for my birthday in April and it made my day. Get the chick pea flour pancakes, the duck salad, and the crepes with chicken and rosemary. Very satisfying and decent prices too.",1
"the biscuits are delicious- and this is coming from someone who has spent many years living in the south. not too heavy, but wonderfully flavorful. our server was attentive and gave great recommendations. try the lavender fizz if you're in the mood for a tasty cocktail!",1
"Stopped by here for some beers -- they had a reasonable selection, and although I was expecting nothing but barrel-conditioned scotch ales (which I think are gross), they had some other drinkable choices. Atmosphere is great, although the crowd seemed a little on the iffy annoying-after-work-crowd-still-in-their-Â­fraternity side. Â Will definitely stop by here again, hopefully it was a fluke, because they seem to have everything else figured out.",1
"Eataly is a very interesting establishment--it consists several smaller restaurants, bars, cafÃ© and an upscale section for fine Italian groceries and other products. The dÃ©cor and the setup is very Italian, I would say it almost feel like walking into an Italian bazaar. It's hard to believe that something like this exists in New York. One of the main downside to this place is it gets really crowded and busy but it is definitely worth checking out.",1
Don't come here asking for a French onion soup. Reminds me of the time I asked for German potatoes at Minetta Tavern. Quick half-arse highlights: Onion soup - bangin Eggs Benedict - it's aighhhht Steak with potatoes - yum North Atlantic salmon with butter cream - not so bad Crepes of any kind - mmmmmm gotta get it; at least a dessert crepe Sandwiches - ehhh it's ok. Nothing magical Half-arse review completed.,1
"I never really base reviews on location usually but I thought Maialino was a gem situated inside the Gramercy Park Hotel. First I was a little disappointed that I couldn't get a reservation for 2 on Open Table and then I just decided to walk in last night with my friend who lives nearby. We got seated right away at the bistro section of the restaurant next to the bar. I actually prefered it here, which gave us more of a casual ambiance to enjoy ourselves. We shared a quartino of my favorite Emilio-Romagna's bubbly Lambrusco to brighten up my day and nibbled on the Straccato di Rapa a wonderful ciccheti or snack dish made of braised rapini with garlic and filone served on the a few perfectly toasted pieces of bread ever! I could really eat this all night if there was nothing else! For my pasta, I chose the Malfatti al Maialino..the suckling pig ragu with arugula with large roughly chopped pieces of thin hand rolled pasta cooked al dente. Ok the suckling pig was tender, juicy and flavorful, I had a tiny little party in my mouth eating ever bite. I also had a taste of my friend's Bucatini all'Amatriciana which was like a spaghetti yet thicker and served with spicy tomatoes. This pasta was cooked perfectly al dente that gave a real chewiness to every bite. Dolci :) Â I couldn't pass up the warm hazelnut bread pudding and I am glad we shared!... Cause sharing is caring :) The toasted hazelnut caramelliness melted in my mouth and it had me with the first bite! :0",1
"Meh, not sure what the big deal is. Food is just ok. We came here for brunch and the food is brunchy but nothing stood out. My lobster sliders had a weird taste, like too much lemon in the mayo. The flavor was too strong and tangy. Didn't hear anything great about the crab or lobster eggs Benedicts. We passed on dessert. I remember the bread being warm and good, but nothing else was memorable. Most likely not returning.",1
"All in all, I'd say the food is good - relatively authentic, hot, yummy greek food. Â  The place itself Â I haven't eaten in, although it doesn't look like it could fit more than a couple people - I have ordered from here 2-3 times - always very flavorful dishes. I have to say in terms of UWS greek, Kefi is still probably my #1, but this is a solid 2nd options. A little pricey for the portions, but it definitely is still on my list of quick, easy greek food that you can get delivered!",1
"Super delicious food, great ambiance, server was adorable, prices a bit steep but worth it, overall I'm very excited to go back soon!",1
"I love this place! After noticing that Northeast Kingdom had gone downhill the past couple of times I had gone, Cafe Ghia is now a go-to. The food is always so good and so fresh and their cocktails are amazing. The staff is always so friendly and helpful also. It's a little expensive to have all the time, but always worth it when I do go.",1
Not that good,1
"In Japan, Ootoya is cheap and fast Japanese food chain restaurant; so I was very surprised when I came to Ootoya in NYC, it was a very nice surprise, as the venu and presentation was much nicer and the food was delicious as well. I came here twice for weekend brunch, unfortunately both time the queue was very long. So be prepared to line and make sure that you were not starving when you arrive. It's very likely you gonna wait for an extra 30 - 45 minutes before you can sit at the table. Each time I came with a number of friends and we all tried different dishes and to be honest, they are all very good. I don't think any dish would let you know down!",1
"Pork buns = orgasm land. Â Note to self, do not offer to share! Cocktails = good, but a little too small on the pouring. Â When I was served my drink, there was so little of it in the glass I felt I was being served a drink someone else had already started drinking! Service = Pretty incredible. Â My friend and I were walking around and wanted to go to the other Momofucku instead. Â The host told us where it was, but said she was going to keep our name on the list in case we couldn't get into the other spot. Â She was incredibly welcoming. Â The servers were also nice, and everyone smiled. Will go back, but first want to try the noodle soup at the other Momofuku. Want to come back when I'm with a boy and we can afford to have those short cocktails, and not get sad about how short they are...because they are very good and I want to try more.",1
Wonderful neighborhood restaurant. The best bruschetta in Brooklyn. My one complaint is that it is too dark in the evening. I like to see my food. It is part of the enjoyment!,1
"My gf and I went on rainy nights. Â yes, it is BYOB and great, but you get what you ask for as far as the service. Â They never came to ask how the food was. Â It was just minimal service. Â In addition, my gf asked for medium well and she got bloody rare. Â She asked to cook for little more and still was medium rare like. Â It's usually opposite in France, when you ask for Medium rare, it will come bloody because French cook little less than the standard Mediums.... Â Anyhow, I say food, and overall service was alright.",1
"This place was my first stop in NYC last week, and it met and exceeded all expectations. It's super cute (though it was crowded), and everyone that works there is an attractive man, wearing an apron, with an accent. Swoon! I don't know if these guys came straight from down under, but I was not complaining. We snagged an outdoor seat and snacked on perfect avocado toast, while sipping on almond milk lattes. I forgot to order mine iced (they looked so refreshing in mason jars with red-and-white striped straws), but it was amazing nonetheless. This whole spot is out of an Instagram dream, and I can't wait to go back and try some other options (like the chia seed bowl or a milkshake)!",1
"Omg, why is it so crowded? Â Do these people not have jobs? I've always wanted to come here and I'm so glad I did. Â I had a sinus infection with a voice of epic cacophony to match but I still came here when an opportunity to have drinks swung by. Â Because that alone doesn't make me look like an alcoholic. That said, they have really good alcohol. Â Service is casual and friendly, and we were lucky enough to score two seats at the bar (which was exactly what I wanted. Â I'm not a fan tables when going to popular bars) so we could see everything up close and personal. I had the Lady Ashley and Mr. Collins, and both cocktails were awesomeeee. Â Smooth and just the way I like it. Â The Lady Ashley has egg white in it, which I was skeptical about at first, but you could hardly taste it at all, and it makes the drink all the more consistent. Â I'd love to try the Mexican Revolver sometime, but the only thing is I'm not a big fan of tequila so maybe when I'm feeling bold enough. We also got the cookie skillet for dessert and it's soo good! Â Cookie is huge and big enough to be shared by 2 people, and it's all warm and chewy and straight from the oven. Â They give you a growler of milk too but no glasses so I actually drank straight from it and he couldn't stop laughing. It's an always crowded place, even when we came here on a Tuesday night. Â So you know it's good.",1
Mexican Corn and an array of hot sauces! SLAMMIN',1
Good food and quaint atmosphere. Staff is a little awkward but I not too bad. The garden is really nice in the back they have fig trees over your heads. Â It is romantic. Â They even provided bug spray for the mosquitos. Most od all the food is very good.,1
"We've been here a couple of times. Â Recently made the mistake of sitting at the bar on a Saturday night, but that was our mistake. Â I love their bone marrow, pig tails, and chicken fried steak. Â It is a casual low key environment and they play great music. Â The staff are friendly and make a pretty good cocktail. A solid choice for a casual night.",1
"We have eaten here twice while visiting New York. The first time, we enjoyed the evening atmosphere and had the fried chicken and waffles. The maple syrup served along with it is white good, and the fried chicken is remarkable. This is coming from a Georgia girl. On our second visit, we had the mac & cheese waffles with fried pork chops. Not as exciting as the fried chicken and waffles from our first visit, but good nonetheless. We will be back soon.",1
"thi place is the BALLZ- srsly- whaaaat the fuck.....so so fukinnn good.....pound of this and 2 pounds of that...the brisket the short rib the pork belly..the fucking BEANS were the hit for me......,stop at the momofucko place next door too....",1
"Let me start off this review by stating that if this restaurant was located in an area more populated with Filipino restaurants, like let's say ... Daly City in CA, my rating would go down to a 2.5 or 3. Â But it is hard enough to find a Filipino restaurant in NYC, let alone in Manhattan -- so 4 stars it is! The place is small but very clean. Â We walked in and were quickly greeted. Â We were seated at a 4-seater table next to the door, which wasn't preferable since we got a huge chill every time the door was opened; even though they did have the 2 door hallway thing going on. They had a pretty wide selection of Filipino dishes on their menu, including the Halo-Halo for dessert. Â The food tasted slightly different then it does back home, as if more Americanized but none-the-less it was good food for nostalgia purposes. I haven't been back since, mainly because of the inconvenience of getting there with all the subway changes on the weekends and the price; but I do plan on making a return visit and would get delivery (pretty) often, if only I was in the delivery zone.",1
Best. Place. Ever. The meat plate appetizer is to die for.,1
"Love the brunch here. Â French people know food. Â My boyfriend and I come here almost every other week. Â We have tried almost every item on the brunch menu and nothing has disappointed us so far. Â Also love the fact that they have wifi here. Â :-) Â Not giving them 5-star is because of the single dinner experience. Â We ordered a few appetizers, which were good but not impressive. Â My boyfriend ordered the steak and he enjoyed it. Â I ordered the special, monkfish wrapped by bacon slices. Â It does sound yummy (and that's why three people in the group ordered it), but didn't taste as good. Â We love the people working there. Â Will come back to try stuff on the regular dinner menu and if something surprises me, I will review again. Â :-)",1
"Reporting the lunch burger of course. It's solid for sure, but I guess my burger scale has been forever altered by Umami. Â The burger itself was juicy with good charred crisp. It was packed a little tight though, and then the factory bun and American cheese weren't so gratifying. Again I think I've been spoiled. A year ago I probably would see this burger in a much better light. Â Fries were delicious and service was great.",1
"I work right around the corner from here so I grabbed a quick lunch with a couple buddies from college. The place itself is great. Huge dining area with bar seating and bar seating by the pizza oven. The pizzas itself were delicious. we got the large New Vermont Sausage pie and a large special which was a Moroccan spiced lamb. Both were delicious. The crust was thin and crispy and every bite was packed with flavor. The Vermont Sausage had the sweet fennel sausage and the caramelized onions which are some of my favorite pizza toppings. The Moroccan spiced Lamb was on point and by far my favorite. The first bite gives you this sweet aromatic scent and the feta cheese was a great addition of flavor. Overall, great great place to grab a bite with coworkers or friends. I'll definitely be coming back for more!",1
"We were craving Vietnamese, but had no idea where to go and relied on Yelp to help. I was surprised there was a highly rated place not far from my place. Saigon Shack is located amongst the bustle and bright lights of Macdougal Street sandwiched between a chili restaurant and pizza place. The exterior window wall was open allowing for a nice breeze to float in...despite its busy surroundings, the restaurant was not loud. We sat at the bar, since the restaurant was packed at about 8 on a Saturday night. We ordered the shrimp and young papaya salad, summer rolls, and the classic pho. The shrimp papaya salad was a good portion size, the fresh minced basil added a nice anise flavor and the dish was very good, the shrimp plentiful. The summer rolls are what you would expect, there wasn't too much filler and the peanut sauce was good..l did add sriracha for a little more spice and was very happy. The pho was aromatic and flavorful, the beef was lean and tasty. The portion size was good and the prices reasonable. The decor was not memorable, but the food was fresh and I didn't leave for want of more, the other entrees coming out looked and smelled delicious and plenty to split. Overall a good dinner, will definitely go back to satiate. Craving.",1
"Not only do they serve superb soup dumplings, they cook some of the best tasting Chinese dishes in Chinatown. Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao. I also am a fan of their pan-fried noodles; the noodles are crisp & soft and topped with this wonderful sauce (I have no idea what it is except it taste really good) and protein(s) of your choice.",1
"Thumbs up if you are considering this early in the morning. Â But if you're going during peek hours, I would think twice in the extreme winter. Nook is very small, but it is that perfectly cute type of place that appeals to NYCers. Â There is really only enough room for the diners and the waiter to walk through the tables. Â When they are at capacity, you must wait outside. Â  The service is delightful. Â I am amazed that this one guy can service nearly 10 tables. He definitely has a very specific system and it works marvelously. Â I think it's pretty amazing that they are so busy and capable that they will even recommend to folks with large groups a restaurant down the street, rather than rudely have them wait forever. Â  As for the food, you can't go wrong. Â We had the eggs Benedict and one of the popular scrambles. Â Both were perfect brunch type fair. Â  All and all an enjoyable experience.",1
"What a great, unique, little Japanese restaurant! Â Definitely make reservations! Â Because most people get hot pot, dinner is usually close to two hours long. Â Every walk-in that came in was told the next available opening was 11pm! Â Also, it gets really hot in there so wear layers! What we got: Crispy sesame chicken wings - these were okay but didn't love the peanut sauce on them that much. Â They are all drumsticks with the head trimmed to create neatly lined pieces. Grilled pig's feet in spicy garlic sauce - this was my first time trying pig's feet and while I'm not a huge fan of the collagen texture, the skin was really great and flavorful Gyoza - delicious Hakata Ton Ton hot pot - oh my gosh. The broth was so amazing. Â The veggies were so fresh and plentiful! Â The tofu was so silky. Â The ramen was a great addition. Mochi cake with strawberry ice cream - yummy and it is packaged so prettily!! Â There is a delicious sweet syrup that you can dip the mochi in Black sesame ice cream - this was very good and tasted like real black sesame Muscat soda - yum! Service: The service was really great. The waitresses were so nice and attentive. Â They set the hot pot up for us and served our first bowl. Â They then add the ramen in the leftover soup of the hot pot and serve in new bowls. Â One of them even came running after us as we were leaving the restaurant to give us pez candy!",1
"Their service is extrememly attentive, friendly, and anticipating of your every need. I had a business lunch there so I found the service very mindful of the time as well. The menu is smaller but I would guess everything is very deliberately planned and perfected to even make it onto the menu. I had the chicken salad, which sounds basic but it was really tasty and definitely not something you would get at a pret-a-manger. My coworkers had the falafel and the quiche special, and everything was solid. This place even got me to eat dessert, so rich. One scoop of dark chocolate gelato is all I needed. My coworker also got some truffle like thing with the caramel popcorn...just as good if not better!",1
"My lunch here was tasty, but not particularly memorable. Â I liked the saltimbocca, plus it was a pretty generous size. Â All-around a solid choice.",1
"The 7 course tasting menu here is incredible-GET THE WINE PAIRING with it. I totally did and was completed done after the meal- and what a meal it was. The vegetable dishes are prepared perfectly- making them interesting as well as familiar in terms of taste and texture. The dessert w The wine pairing was fabulous- especially the whites. Oh, and did I mention that we started the meal with glasses of champagne? Needless to say, the rest of the night was a blur. Sitting at the bar is a a great, as well as mandatory experience (since these are the only seats). It's fun to watch your dishes being prepared, as well as asking the chefs and waitstaff for specific ingredients used and wines poured.",1
"I'm writing this after stepping foot in this establishment twice. Â My first experience several months ago was way better than my experience yesterday. Â First off, the service was terrible. Â And almost every dish that came out tasted like salt and soy sauce overload! Â We ordered HOKKE SHIOYAKI Grilled Hokke Fish (Atka mackerel), Yellowtail Carpaccio, Miso Fried Drumsticks, and Cheese Ricecake. Â It may have just been an off night but I left super thirsty. Â I think I'm going to have to stick to the better choices of Yakitori Totto, Sake Bar Hagi, and Oh Taisho!",1
"Gotta love that Friday night dinner. We came in around 7:30pm and were seated right away. The hostess was very friendly and our waitress took our drink orders right away. The place overall was very dimly lit and intimate, which makes it perfect for a date night. Also, you could see into the kitchen, which is always pretty cool. We decided to get a pizza and a few appetizers, which we definitely did not regret. After a lot of mulling over the menu, we decided on the Tartufata pizza (wild mushrooms), crispy artichokes, octopus, and the foie gras stuffed arancini. Also, the complimentary rosemary bread that came out was delicious, and they kept bringing it out when we ran out, even though we didn't ask. Awesome. Octopus was decent, although a bit on the chewier side. However I did like the crisp on the outside of the octopus skin. The Crispy artichokes were very good too, but it took a little bit of work to differentiate between the edible heart and the crispy outer shell. The foie gras stuffed arancini was bomb though, and even though you only get 3 small rice balls, I would say it's well worth it. Finally, the pizza came out, and I was surprised at how large it was, definitely bigger than at Motorino and Forcella. Also, they used a variety of different wild mushrooms, including hen of the woods mushrooms, which are my favorite. Overall, it's a bit on the pricier side, but the waitstaff is reliable and friendly, and you can tell they use really good ingredients. Definitely will be back for date night. Next time, I'll have to try the pastas, if I can tear myself away from ordering the pizza again.",1
"Really tasty food! I highy reccomend the mahi-mahi taquitos... soooo delicious! the salmon was good, too as well as the fried sweet plaintains. I'd definitely go back and sample more of the menu. The place is pretty small and narrow, so that's the only negative. Not the most comfy seating, but the food more than makes up for it!",1
We stopped in here for an afternoon snack after rock climbing a while back. It was a little too late in the day so their bakery goods were mostly gone. So my bf decided to have the duck pastrami. It was so good! We both wanted more! I also liked their cannele and cheesecake a lot. And their espresso drinks were quite good. I definitely need to go back for a proper meal so I can give them a proper review.,1
Unfortunately I had already eaten by the time I came here so this review is for the bar area only. The area is small but the drinks are interesting and tasty. It's not a restaurant bar that youwould normally come out of your way to have a drink at; more of an area to kill time whilie waiting for your table to be ready. I ordered their Cherry Blossom and the group I was with ordered some Japanese draft beer. Overall enjoyed the experience.,1
To be honest don't recall too much about this place. Was satisfied when I went but food wasn't necessarily memorable or what I would seek out in Chinatown.,1
Lots of authentic Shanghai dishes but get one star off because of its awful dim sum.,1
"I went to this place during lunch and I think that overall, the place is decent. Â Nothing to rave about, but good quality overall. The wines and appetizers are very reasonably priced, and I think that is one of the points to note about Il Baretto. The food was decent, I had a salad and 1/2 sandwich combo for 10 bucks, which really cannot be beat in Midtown. Â I had a mixed green salad, which was ok, along with a prosciutto sandwich which was nothing to brag about either. From the pictures on Yelp, this place appeared to be a decent sized restaurant, however at most the venue could probably seat 25-30. Â Keep in mind in case you intend on having lots of people. If you can consider this place to be anything, please consider it to be an italian-style coffee shop offering a vast menu in case you get hungry. Would definitely go again for a lunchtime affair, but I am not particularly expecting to be completely wowed.",1
i pledge my allegiance to the burger. might be my favorite thus far. can't wait to go back!,1
"There is just no motivation to write a review for this place, other than that I promised the girl I went with I'd write one. I have a weird feeling this is some type of way for her to see if I'll comply to her judgment. Little does she know... her opinion means nothing to me. Â  Â  I'm kidding. That was just to illustrate to her that I'm capable of independent thought. When she reads this, I can expect a very aggressive text. Â  Â  Anywho, I don't... really care for this place. I get it, it's sushi for vegans. Except I can't really shake the feeling that it tastes so far off from conventional sushi that it should be consider something entirely different. Take the ""Green Machine"" for example, it tastes like a vegetable smoothie. It was actually kind of refreshing... for a steep price. Â  Â  The item that came the closest to tasting like conventional sushi was the Mighty Mushroom & the Roll of the Week, something with Oyster (probably oyster mushrooms considering it's vegan). You can guess why, mushrooms are the closest thing in the vegetable kingdom to taste like meat. Which makes perfect sense to me now because an ex of mine hates mushrooms and she's not really a meat person. Â  Â  The place is small, so if you have trouble making a genuine connection with strangers, I don't advise eating in. Â  Â  One cool thing about this place though, is that they give you 8 pieces per roll. Also, the sauces. I can't forget the sauces. There's Shitake Teriyaki, Chill Mango, Toasted Cayene, & etc. It's all on their website.",1
"This restaurant is tight, tasty and fun. Â The menu is short, just fish, seafood and fish, although there are burgers if you have one anti-fish person in your party. Â My swordfish was perfectly cooked, and the vegetable melange and mashed potatoes that came with it were well prepared. Â The corn crab chowder is too rich though, very creamy. My spouse had scallops, and he refused to share, so I can't Â comment on them. Â BYOB.",1
"LOVE the Mediterranean salad here! The food is always solid here down to the yummy bread. They never mind substitutions and the staff is SO friendly. They also have a great space - both inside and outside seating, as well as an upstairs space if you have a large party. Yum!",1
"Great staff, and great happy hour oyster deal. Am obsessed with their old bay fries. Unfortunately the lobster roll was way too salty. It could've been great but wasn't. Would definitely return for the oyster deal and old bay fries!",1
"The Best Street food in new york ! been going to tony's for 15 years now, never disappoint.",1
Cute little wine bar with some tasty (and inexpensive) eats. Â The ribs were really good. Â We ordered two servings. Â The fried olives were good as well and went great with the wine.,1
"This place is pretty much Chipotle for falafel and shawarma. You're on an assembly line of sandwiches and you pick a pick a bunch of toppings, then you fork over $2-3 more than you really need to (but that's the case anywhere in Manhattan). The difference between this place and Chipotle is that while the burrito fillings at Chipotle have distinct flavors and textures, the falafel here is bland, mushy, and undifferentiated. I had what I thought were going to be several tasty toppings inside the pita, but in the end it tasted pretty much like salty, vinegary nothing. This place is a step above an average falafel cart only in that it is clean and efficient, but food-wise it's entirely forgettable.",1
"Very cheap dumplings; however, I wouldn't eat here again. The dumplings, regardless of their flavor, are not made properly. The proportion of dumpling skin to the filling is completely off. The skin of the dumpling is too thick, which is a shame given that it tastes decent.",1
This place has amazing big cut fries lightly salted just right. But what makes it good are all the different sauces they have to offer with your fries. I need to go here a few more times just so I can try more of the different sauces. It was a fun experience.,1
"I love Alameda and I wish they were open for lunch! There are a few places in Greenpoint that really play off of the sea shanty atmosphere, and Alameda does it so well. The rustic wood, the beautiful bar and the long mirrors lend to a dark, romantic atmosphere. One where you can gaze into your lover's eyes across a candle-lit table or sit alone in silence, mentally rewriting page 78 of your novel. Recently, I was doing neither. A few coworkers and I were hungry after a long day at the office, so we settled on Alameda. We got fancy cocktails (I had the 'Little Red Book' and it was so delicious!) and fancy foods. I ordered the sweet corn and the dish haunts me to this day! It was just so simple but good. I really need to make it at home, but until then, I'll visit Alameda over and over again...Lurking in the dark corners, looking way too pensive. (this is probably the most unhelpful Yelp review I've ever written. synopsis: get the corn thing, bring a date, or not. you won't be disappointed. also, my friends swear by the burger)",1
"2 words: IMITATION CALAMARI. Seriously, show me a tentacle. This has to be imitation. Look it up on NPR... Song's calamari really matches the description. Don't get me wrong, I used to think it was delicious until I realized it probably wasn't calamari.",1
Two words: grilled octopus. Â  It will change your life.,1
"Not to be confused with The Landmarc. But this is a great upper-scale Irish pub in the middle of a nowhere zone. I came here on one of my random extra vacation days off this month to do lunch with a friend that is working across the street and then later was surprise visited by the Howie. It's a pretty good staple pub. They have old photos on the walls of celebrity guests that have bombed in. I think Lorne Michaels was in one of them? I could be totally wrong though, it definitely looked like him and a bunch of people dressed up as bumble bees. Though, I'm sure everyone has been here at some point, except for me till now, it is one of the oldest bars in the city and at one point was a speakeasy during the Prohibition. Their beer is a little over-priced, but expected. $6-7 but you have a decent selection and their house tavern Landmark Ale is not too shabby. I had one of those and the rest of Finlay's Blue Moon. Sandwiches? Okay. Decent for a lunch hour at work but I don't take lunch while I'm working, so what do I know. My friends respectively had a chicken and cheese quesadilla and a corned beef sandwich. While I stuck with a chicken and avocado on sourdough bread. Very mild on taste and under-seasoned, but decent fries with a not too heavy a handed portion size. They also have more exotic faire like: Bangers/Mash, Sheperds pie, fish and chips, and lobster ravioli. Great service though. They accommodated us for when we wanted to move to a larger table to fit in a third person mid-way through our beers. I've never been for happy hour but it is apparently from 4-7pm for buy one get one frees and 10 cent buffalo wings. My only problem with this little Irish pub is that it is way the freaking far out there.",1
"The best ramen I've ever had. Not only is the broth flavorful, but the noodles are amazing! I've been to several other ramen houses and the ramen there tastes store bought. However, the noodles at Totto are made in front of you, and they are the perfect consistency and flavor. There's usually a long wait, but it's worth it.",1
"Was told great things about Bubbys and decided to give it a try. Was happily surprised that the wait was only 20 minutes on a saturday at 1pm. Started with a delicious watermelon lemonade that was really refreshing. For food i opted for the eggs benedict and we got a plate of their blueberry pancakes to share. Was quite dissapointed with the eggs benedict as the canadian bacon was average but more importantly, i bit into a huge piece of shell on one of the eggs that just ruined the meal for me. Every bite after that i was just dreading that there might be another piece of egg shell. Other than that, the food was good and was a nice place.",1
"Great variety of happy hour drinks-peach, ginger, lychee, calamansi-but not strong. Ambiance was a little bright for 7pm but not a big deal. Small menu. Spicy (shredded) pork buns had soft tasty dough and the sauce was amazing! Not as spicy to my liking but still good. Apps came together with dinner entrees-which I get annoyed from so sent our entrees back until we finished our apps. The bus boy didn't get it and told us we should have told our waitress we wanted our apps 1st?! Duh! Bicol express was on point. Meat was soft and seasoned perfect. Coconut milk was very comforting! Portions were average. Grilled bangus was part of the specials. Well cooked, wrapped in banana leaf with side of seasoned spinach. Decent piece of fish. Both served with side of garlic fried rice. Definitely fulfilled my Filipino food craving!",1
"Food: ~Cuban sandwich (3 stars): made to order. Â It was a little bit underwhelming, but perhaps I was expecting too much. Â The ham tasted as if it'd just come from a supermarket, but it was nice toasty when we ate it. Â The melted cheese and sauce made it better than it would have been. Â $5.50 ~Octopus salad (4 stars): even though it was cold outside, I didn't want to stop eating it. Â After eating half, however, I did think that the acidity became a bit much. Â It was essentially an octopus salsa. $10 Wait: no wait for a table for 2 at 1:30pm on a Friday, but it took about 10 minutes after we ordered/paid for the Cuban sandwich, as they are each made to order. I don't think we'll come out of our way to eat here again, but it does serve up simple, decent Cuban food.",1
"Mighty Quinn's occupies the space that Vandaag used to be in. I realized this as I was having my very delicious dinner here along with a friend. Like most BBQ places it's self-serve cafeteria style. We ordered the brisket, ribs, and 3 sides along with pickles. The brisket was so tender and the ribs were full of flavor. You can't go wrong with either choice. As for the sides we both loved the bean salad and the baked beans with browned ends. Both were so good. We also had the yams but that was a little too sweet. All together our food cost $23 per person excluding beverages. Not bad at all since if I remember correctly Fette Sau is a bit more expensive. I've heard the lines get long but we were there when it was one of those freezing nights so we didn't have to wait at all. I'm glad Manhattan finally got its BBQ spot!",1
Plan to come earlier than you normally eat. The hungrier you are the slower it seems to move! the baked beans are awesome. Â wasnt crazy about the ribs but the brisket? dynamite!,1
"Sooooo good Â falafal sandwich yum even their lentil soup is good a little spicy but I don't mind, great hours for when you have a late night or even get hungry late.",1
"I've never left a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth and the worse part was that my husband also felt the same way. Â  The food itself wasn't bad. We had the spicy appetizer and the Monkey Roll along with the Three Style sushi with spicy tuna roll. Â Aside from the spicy tuna roll which was definitely fishy, the rest was tasty. Â Far cry from the best I've ever hard or even delicious, but sufficient to satisfy our sushi craving if not for the fact that we should NEVER EVER EVER leave a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth. Â We were both so horrified that we feared that we had to run across the street to buy a pack of gum to get rid of the flavor and it took a while! I genuinely feared that I would get sick when I get home. I will NEVER return to Iron Chef. Â Don't be mistaken by the packed house, there are better places nearby, namely the one across the street which is DEAD, but SUSHI is unbelievably fresh.",1
"Been here for brunch a few times. There's usually a long line at prime hours so I'd recommend getting here early or making a reservation. On to the food! The presentation is so nice and clean. Whoever was in charge of the plating at Jane is a genius. Every dish that comes out of the kitchen looks stunning. You'll be able to get your traditional brunch favorites here like eggs benedict and steak and eggs. Each brunch item came with a free alcoholic beverage. Nice! My favorite brunch dish there is the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly Â medium rare and was tender and juicy to the core. The home fries were pretty tasty as well. They probably weren't that good for my cholesterol level, but what home fries are healthy anyways? Visit Jane for a slightly upscale and trendy brunch spot which serves great food.",1
"I'm so glad I found out about a gem like this near work. Â If you work in FiDi and need a crepe to hold you over until 5PM strikes, this is definitely worth making it outside to get. Â Even after walking in the rain to bring this crepe back, I thought it would've been soggy by the time I got back to the office, but it was still crispy!! I got the Nutella & Bailey's crepe which did not fail to satisfy my craving for sweets.",1
"I have been craving cheung fan, lately, and I'm so happy that I found Sun Hing Lung Co. Â I used to go to the prep school that is next to this place, and I never knew that you can just get it right there. Â When I was younger, I would always go to the cart in front of the Hong Kong Supermarket on Allen St before the supermarket burned down (now it's a Mariott Hotel). Â  Anyways, Sun Hing Lung Co. is different than the other carts or other places that serve cheung fan because they make it fresh. Â I don't mean a fresh batch that they put in the steamer, I mean a fresh batch right from the liquefied mixture to solid cheung fan. Â I had the roast pork cheung fan, the pork cheung fan, and the mixed vegetable cheung fan. Â I liked the mixed vegetable more than the pork because of the cilantro and the corn (my favorite vegetables). Â  Another good thing is that they allow you to mixed your sauce. Â This is a big plus because I never seem to get enough sauce in my cheung fan. Â Don't ask for the cups because I think the sauce is different. Â I used one and I think it's just soy sauce, not the one you put in cheung fan.",1
This rating is only for the pistachio ice cream. If you are a fan try this flavor. Wasn't too impressed by the salted caramel or the mixed berry.,1
"Although I absolutely love Yelp, I am well aware that ratings can become skewed by single-time reviewers. Â Therefore, I remain a bit wary when I visit restaurants with an exceedingly good review. La Sirene's 4.5 star rating, however, is warranted in every way. Two of my friends and I have been dying to try La Sirene for ages. Â After several rescheduled attempts, we finally were able to coordinate and came here for dinner on a cold and severely windy Thursday night. Â We stopped by Wine Hut, a few blocks away, to pick up a couple nice bottles of vin since La Sirene is byob. Â Upon our arrival to the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by our waitress who offered to immediately open our bottles for us. Â We started with the chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc while we let the Pinot Noir breathe. There was no corkage fee, which wins major brownie points. Â  After a few moments, we placed our orders. Â One of my friends and I had the special of the day, which was a seared black sea bass entree. Our other, more adventurous dining companion had the roasted quail. Â All entrees come with the chef's selection of market vegetables and are unlimited. Â What a great incentive for someone like me to eat more veggies! Â  When our food arrived, I was tempted to dig in at once. Â But girls being girls, my dates were animatedly complaining about billiards clubs and I didn't want to be rude by starting first. Â After what seemed like an eternity, my friend picked up her fork and I breathed a sigh of relief as I got the green light to feast. The sea bass was cooked wonderfully, the meat was tender and flaky. Â Accompanied by a slightly tangy beurre blanc sauce and crispy wedges of potato gratin cake, it was the perfect marriage of flavors and textures. Â The seasonal vegetables of the night were eggplant, chayote, yellow squash and pureed sweet potato. Â Each of them were equally buttery and delicious. My friends and I had such a relaxing time catching up and drinking wine that we stayed there well past midnight. Â Our waitress was very engaging and jovial, making small talk with us the whole night. Â With the amazing service, food and ambiance, it truly reminded me of some of my favorite meals in Paris. You can bet I will be back here again.",1
Beautiful place which recently moved from Amsterdam to W 81st. I met some friends after dinner for drinks so this review is NOT based on the food. The bar is cozy with plenty of room to sit back and enjoy. The Mojitos are LEGIT. I was impressed. It is the perfect place to take a date. It's on my follow up list. The food looked damned GOOD!,1
"Second visit here and it is definitely one of my favorite neighborhood spots. We were able to make a reservation last minute on a Friday night and were seated immediately when we entered. Water was brought to our table right away and service was quick and very friendly. We ordered the lamb nachos and the club sandwich and both were great. The lamb nachos were a huge portion and definitely good enough for a group to share. The club sandwich was fresh and tasty and perfectly prepared. They also came with a side of fries, but I was so stuffed from the nachos that I didn't get to try these. The hubby liked them though and we were both happy that we chose this place for our Friday night date night. This place will be in rotation for sure.",1
"So I was watching an episode of How I Met Your Mom and the episode was about the best burger in NYC and it had me craving a burger. Obviously Marshall's ultimate best burger place probably doesn't exist in the real world... I mean its television, right? Anyways I decided to at least try the random guy's suggestion on the show and go to Corner Bistro. Now with the name Corner Bistro I was expecting some high end over elaborate burger, with costumers drinking wine and asking for no buns! HA! Was I so wrong but so happy that this little burger/bar joint was so divey, down to earth, and DELICIOUS! The menu is simple: - Bistro Burger, which is a Bacon Cheese Burger (AMAZING!) Symphony playing in the background - Cheeseburger (Where's the bacon?) - Hamburger (Where's the cheese?) - Chicken Sandwich (who gets that at burger joint?) - BLT - Grilled Cheese (For those non meat eaters... head shakes) I got my burger medium and it was perfectly pink in the middle, juicy and meat-a-licious! I'm a small girl, so there's no way I got my mouth around the whole burger for an all inclusive bite. I know it's a sad feeling to never get an all in one bite. The burger itself is good enough for me, but we ordered fries. Honestly, you can skip those nothing special there. Maybe they can work on that... some delightful tater tots or fresh cut fries or even some onion rings, could be better but I won't hold it against them, I came for the burger. Bar: They have a $3 McSorley's Ale and Dark! Prefect to wash down the burger when you took too big of a bite or you're having meat sweats! It's a full service bar but they have very good priced drafts and bottles. I have no idea how much are the liquors, plus beer makes the tummy happy when combined with beer. Atmosphere: Divey, dark, and crowded at 8pm but dies down around 930ish (Tuesday). Nothing too fancy but a prefect after work spot, I LOVE IT! Service: The guys were all very nice, got the food out quickly and didn't interrupt us, and kept the beers full. Wow it's probably one of the better service experiences I've had in a while; the perfect balance of attention and consideration.",1
"My best friend and I were starving on Sunday and were heading toward SoHo in a cab. Â Decided we couldn't wait to eat and after a quick search on Yelp, found ourselves at Nook. Â It was 3:30 and they had one table available. Â It was perfect. Â This place is cash only and BYOB. Â We ordered the ahi tuna salad to share and each got a scramble. Â They don't allow substitutions. Â I got a sausage, gouda and onion scramble and she got the tomato, goat cheese and something else scramble along with a side of lox. Â She said the salmon was amazing. Â I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. Â Ready to come back and try the burger!",1
"This place was great from start to finish. Went on a friday night and everything from the service to the atmosphere to the food made for a truly great experience. My bf and I shared the hummus (awesome, esp for a chickpea lover). I got a few apps and my bf got the steak. Amazing. We split the chocolate cake with ice cream and it was a great ending to the meal. All in all a wonderful meal...I highly recommend it.",1
"Small place, long lines and waits, but definitely worth it. I recommend sitting at bar if you have a small group of 2 or 3. Definitely get: Kawa - chicken skin Chicken oyster (if they still have it, they run out early) Nankotsu Tsukune - meatball mixed up with spices Pork with Mustard Momo - chicken thigh deep-fried small silver fish Definitely a little bit pricey at $3-6 bucks per skewer of meat. You could probably eat 5 of those and another small dish and you'd be good to go. Not the best Yakitori I've ever had, but close to it in NYC",1
"Perfect place for DRUNCHIES (drunken munchies)!! Too bad it closes at 3 though.. would be perfect if it opened 24/7. Food is pretty cheap. LOVE their japchae, fish cakes, cucumber banchan, and soup. When I bring my friends, their eyes always light up after taking a bite of my japchae. Still in the process of filling up my stamp card. I want that ceramic rice pot dammit!! I never experienced their side buffet area. Is it even a buffet? I don't understand why they shut that down late at night when there's clearly food left over... especially where there's hungry customer here who's willing to pay for the leftover food!! If you stay until closing, they'll kindly remind you that they're closing in ___ minutes and for us to leave. I appreciate that they're not rude :)",1
"All I ever order is Laksa, Laksa and Laksa. It's cheap, quick, and super duper delicious. I've tried laksa in some other restaurants and they tasted totally disgusting compared to Taste Good. Definitely one of my favorites. P.S. my friends also love the Hainanese chicken",1
"That is a GOOD spot to know about. I really never go to this neighborood for restaurants but I have to say that was a great idea to walk there with those friends visiting who were staying close by. The atmosphere is really really nice, the place is GREAT ! Food is simple, great, fresh and cheap ! Service was good and nice ! a great spot for a diner with a friend, a simple date or with daddy and momy in town !",1
"This place is wonderful - great service and excellent food! I came here for dinner to try out all the dishes other reviewers keep raving about and was very pleased. - Consider Bardwell Pawlet: LOVE LOVE LOVE and could not stop talking about how great the cheese and honey was. - Gemelli: Delicious but not something that blew my mind. I'm more interested in trying some other entrees next time. - Half Roasted Chicken: Very juicy with crispy chicken skin! Amazing! - Baby Jesus Cake with creme fraiche ice cream: I had to try it since so many people said it's a must. Although, it is very good and the creme fraiche was a nice balance, I didn't think it was as excellent as everyone did. Maybe it's just me... All in all, I would definitely try this place again.",1
"so i guess its been a while. so long ive lost my elite status! hopefully i can change that in due time. was able to come here a while back for lunch and had a great time. service was great and the food was solid. food itself id probably give 3 and a half stars, but overall, think 4 stars fits the bill. i was told to get the meatball sliders and they did not disappoint. very good. the name says it all really. cant go wrong. my entree, i kinda' took the safe route and went with their burger. it was quite tasty. wish it was a little bigger. but everything cooked perfectly and their pickles were a great compliment. overall it was a good experience. i would like to try their dinner menu sometime and see what they're about. definitely think its worth a try.",1
Jane was at the top of my list while visiting New York. I DID NOT KNOW they did not serve their brunch menu on weekdays :( So many great dishes that I wanted to try but couldn't. Regular eggs benedict with side salad (4 stars) The hollandaise sauce was amazing and the dressing on the salad was so tasty. Rosemary French fries (4 stars) Fried artichokes (4 stars) breaded perfectly Ambiance was not cute at all and the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress was one of the worst ive had in years. Don't remember her name but she was African American and had a bad attitude =/ I would definitely come back to try all of their tasty looking benedicts on the weekends.,1
"Not only they serve their signature banh mi, but also noodle soups, vietnamese desserts and buns. I usually just go there for banh mi, their #1 is just out of the world, especially when I'm hungry. Â The ladies there are very friendly and attentive, but they also toast my bread no matter what language (both chinese and english)I tried to tell them, hence; one star deduction. i guess i should try vietnamese next time. Â their bread is fresh but just too crispy to my taste. I also ask them for vegetarian banh mi (not on the menu) occasionally when i'm in vegetarian mood, very generous on veggies like i mentioned on last review, but of cos not as tasty as w meats!",1
"Heaven is brunch at Cafe Habana starting with a hot Latina waitress and a cafe con leche. It also includes some of the best huevos rancheros I've had this side of Zihuatenejo, some of that chili-spiced corn and another cafe con leche. The only thing heaven doesn't include is the inevitable wait for a table, even at the takeout joint next door sometimes. That's why I'm not giving this place a perfect five, but it's still worth the wait.",1
"Cute little wine bar - my friend and I came here on a Wednesday night around 7, and although it's a tiny place, there was no wait. Â We ordered a bottle of white wine (which was good, not great), then split the mussels and fish & chips. Â We also got the chocolate cake for dessert, which was the best part of the meal. Â Overall the food was pretty good, and we left completely satisfied. It would be a great place for a date, as it's very intimate and there are floral arrangements all over the bar and tables. Â Our waiter was super attentive and friendly, and we didn't have to wait long for anything. Â It's a little out of the way for us to go again, but I would recommend it to others who are in the area.",1
"nice little place in the middle of chelsea market, service is relley good and the stuff is very responsive and friendly. many options for vegetarians and even vegans, so bottom line... i like this place!",1
"This is my favorite restaurant in the village. I always get a bottle of wine and the cheese plates. Food is a bit hit or miss, I had some ratatouille that was obviously made a few days before and probably microwaved. I don't expect perfection at these prices though! Service is slow in the European tradition, and I like how they give you the check in a paper back book.",1
Great food at very decent prices. Always goes here when I'm in NYC. This is the Cafecito Mojito.,1
"Tink's just keeps tinkering away at success. This small eclectic restaurant oozes with the definition of ""new american"" cuisine. I brought my GF here on a date night for dinner to really try something special and amazing is what I was reciprocated with. Their menu serving sizes is a very Tapa's style however it is slightly larger than those average tapa's making it filling enough without having to break the bank. We ordered 4 dishes and left satisfied. After reading several recommendations we went with the - Shrimp & Grits : Delicious southern taste about it. With the moderate seasoning on the shrimp and cohesion with the buttery deliciousness of the grits, it was a very well balanced plate. A must get, even if you are not from the south. - Ricotta have it Gnocchi : Â GF loves the Gnocchi. Here it was lathered up in truffle oil and you can smell that thing from a mile away. It was only alright to us. Nothing to blow you out of the water, but still good. - Pretzel covered Fried Chicken : This one is a winner. Soooo tender, flavorful and the sweet/spicy sauce they serve with it made it all come together.I would eat this over and over again. The skin was very crispy and you can tell they just fried it. - Scallops : Was served over a bed of some blackish grainy risotto tasting rice. It was still good though. The scallops were on the saltier side so the black risotto rice was a great complement. There is a splash of some mayo style sauce which you should not forget to mix. Eat the scallops with the rice and sauce to fully enjoy this dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were juicy and not overcooked. Atmosphere: Very eclectic. Design reminded me of some saloon from the pioneer days of America. Had a classical and trendy twist about it. Was definitely up to par. Service: Only two waiters/waitresses and they performed excellently. We were checked up on and waited well with a good attitude. Food did take longer to come out as the place was hopping and busy but not too long that we got upset or anything. Summary: Great location for a small group of friends or a date night! I would recommend not brining more than 4. The pretzel covered fried chicken and the shrimp and grits are a must have! I do regret not getting the pot pie as it looked amazing when someone else got it! Oh wells, next time! Tink's is definitely a t(h)inker in they way they composed their dishes and run their business. Definitely will be back for another.",1
"Came here during restaurant week, price fixed 3 course lunch special, woo! Outdoor seating was lovely, tomato salad yummy, waitress was helpful and friendly - bus service was lacking. Never received bread, had to ask several times for water refill. Overall a nice place to bring out-of-towners but I wouldn't have liked it as much without the price fix.",1
"Let me just say, the decor is AWESOME - it gives off a feel of fanciness, while the prices are CHEAP!!! Lunch specials starting at $6.90 with full waiter service is not a bad deal in NYC :)",1
"Pretty good, the fried corn and cuban sandwich was great. Â The fish tacos were eh. Â Would go back though, very cool place.",1
"The best pizza in NY! Â Some might say Grimaldi's is the best but I disagree. Â Lombardi's Margarita pizza is consistently excellent - the service is prompt and even when you see lines around the corner, you can get a table in a reasonable amount of time. Â No trip to Little Italy would be complete without a vist to Lombardi's!",1
Pretty pricey but the food was really good. Â The beet salad was excellent and the apple strudel was to die for. Â I imagine that the apple strudel in Inglourious Basterds tasted like this. It even tastes good when sitting next to the Nazi that killed your entire family. Inside the Neue Galerie.,1
"This is a gem in Chinatown where you will get good informal Cantonese cuisine. Â  The place is not fancy but hit the spot every time. Â  Â Enjoy their duck, roasted pork, and the fried thick noodles when you get the chance to go.",1
"I found Spicy Village through yelp, and I am so happy that Yelpers introduced me to this place. The decor is nothing fancy - it's a family run business. The people here are friendly, but the service is your typical hole in the wall service. However, the servers here actually smile. What I love about this place is the authentic of the food. I ordered the egg and tomatoes with noodles, which is a dish that usually granny makes at home. You almost never find it at restaurants. The noodle's texture is just perfect with just the right amount of chewiness. It's a non-pretentious restaurant that people should check out. It's not too crowded yet at the moment, but this is a nice place, and I hope it'll do well.",1
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and had somewhat high expectations. even though it's primarily a brunch place, i have this naive belief that if a restaurant knows how to do one meal well, they can also do the other one well. i was probably too optimistic because dinner was severely disappointing. i ordered the duck breast and while it was a nice medium rare, it was sinewy and the flavor was boring. the portion was tiny and expensive. i also shared a side of broccoli rabe with my friend and it was pretty underwhelming",1
"Came with a group of 4 on a Saturday for brunch, we were lucky to get a tablet. Â Unfortunately, we had to sit outside on a chilly day but thank God for the french press coffee. Â You can order coffee in its own french press and enjoy delicious french roast along with the multitude of crepes available. Seating is very limited, most are seated outside so make sure you get here early on a cold day. Â Food was enjoyable and price was not too high at all. Â Best thing about this spot is it is outside of the main areas of Bedford and Berry, so parking is much easier and a lot less people. Â With the quality of food and word of mouth, there's no way this place will be a secret.",1
"First off service was great, friendly and very efficient. Now the food- I got the Gyro platter. very generous but the meat was way overcooked and I swear I bit into a bone like twice ( that's when I stopped eating it and just ditched it) The menu suggested it was beef and lamb, but it basically tasted like sum type of ground meatloaf Â full of bread crumbs. Yukkkk I got falafels and they were stale and cold, the rice was hard and cold. Basically the food looks good but it's this pre- made system (buffet like) where the food has been sitting there for a while. So it's like playing Russian roulette.. I'll stick with Tiam and mammons from now on.",1
"Been here a while ago, just never reviewed the location. Â I rate all bbq places based on their brisket, and this brisket is the best brisket on this side of the Mason Dixon line. Â Nothing in NY comes close to this fatty brisket. Â Amazing flavor a texture. Â The lean brisket, however, is a hit or miss. Â It can be just the right texture to eat, or as dry as cardboard. Â  The sides were decent and there's an unlimited supply of white bread and pickles, no complaints from me! Â Go there early, because they only have so much meat each day. Â The brisket and beef ribs run out quick! Â Definitely a good bbq place to hit up.",1
"2 stars or 1, really not sure. Â Tried pork taco, chicken- both seemed way overly cooked and dried out. Â Flavorless, not juicy as a taco should be. Â The tortilla though actually had some flavor to it. What did look amazing? The huge nachos platter served next to us. Â Now that might be very good!",1
"Food is a 3, ambience/bar/whisky is a 4+. Not sure how I'm feeling about NYC BBQ. Both here and Hill Country have amazing brisket, but every other cut leaves much to be desired. My friend who raved about this place also didn't seem to like much of the other meats and cuts other than the brisket. Maybe it was a fluke. Who knows. Anyway, we got the brisket, the short ribs, the lamb shoulder, the pork belly, and the shredded pork shoulder. I thought the pork belly was ok. Definitely had better elsewhere (many elsewheres). Lamb was just not very good. It was neither tender, nor flavorful, and definitely lacked a good lamb-y taste. I enjoyed the shredded pork shoulder; it was my second favorite after the brisket. Still, even then, my friend seemed to not like it. The brisket, well it looks like everyone knows how good the brisket is. If I had to do it again, I'd go mostly in on the brisket, with just a few tastes of the other stuff. Oh and good whiskey selection.",1
My girlfriend and I eat once or twice a week in a Thai place and this place is definitely one of our favorites! Their won ton soup is great and the pad se we is for sure one of the best in NYC! They are super affordable and delicious! Always welcoming and we never had a bad time here! Very good place for a mid week casual dinner!,1
"Great place to go if in the area, but I would not go out of my way for it. Â Grimaldi's was better in my opinion.",1
Cuban sandwich was juicy and delicious. Â I'll definitely be back,1
"Food was good but pricey. Portions were small. Service was lacking. We ordered coconut rice , chickpea, sisig, and crispy red curry salad. Coconut rice was A+. one of the best I've had. I think its even better than sripraphai's Sisig was good with the rice. texture of pig head is not for every1. Crispy salad also very good. Chickpeas... I have no idea why any 1 would eat that. It was dry hard and just hard to eat. Service was slow. . place was packed and had to request several times for our rice to come while our food was sitting at the table. I tried this place out with a google offer. Food was good. I cannot justify coming here and paying 12-14 bucs for a small plate.",1
"Had a very nice dinner experience last month. The ambiance was that of an upscale but rustic farmhouse. The service was informed and attentive without being too formal. Menu and specials were plentiful and innovative. We did share the pig face and the veal heart salad, both were very good and it was an opportunity to have something not offered elsewhere. The pastas were also great, creative pairing of ingredients. If I had a criticism it would be that the pasta portions were on the small side. Sommelier was also informed and helpful. Desserts all around the table were delicious. The only thing short of 5 stars is the over seasoned mackerel and the lack of more interesting breads in the basket, a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner in a warm and inviting farmhouse!",1
Yea this place is pretty cool. Not much of an oyster person. But as a first timer it was a pleasant experience. Service very friendly.,1
"It was like eating happiness in a Styrofoam container. It's cheap, it's awesome, its what any persona on a pitiful budget could wish for. If only they gave me my 2 orders of dumplings with soy sauce. (you have to hunt down and put it on yourself) Though there is no sitting area and it is really crowded the food was well worth my legendary uncomfortableness. Â  (I'm a bit claustrophobic. and I will be going back.)",1
"The best katsu place in NYC. Hire Katsu set course dinner that comes with a bowl of rice and miso soup is always a solid choice. I have tried their Katsu Curry as well: the curry is pretty good, but it honestly just tastes like instant Japanese curry and the portion of katsu is small. Oyako Don isn't too bad, but I wouldn't recommend it over any other Katsu dish. The service is pretty inconsistent though, so be aware.",1
"Fun little hole in the wall. Â Classic Japanese blue collar cuisine where you can order a variety of dishes, drink beer or sake, and feel like you have a secret locale in Midtown. Â None of the food particularly excels (for example, one can wander down the street to Yakitori Totto for perfect yaki). Â Gets crowded. But for those that arrive early enough especially for a quick social bite after work, NYC is lucky to have such places.",1
"Charming atmosphere, fantastic selection of cheeses",1
Their happy hour is one of the best. Lychee martinis are strong and delicious! Great bartender!,1
"This review is about 7 months late lol Being a tourist, Grimaldi's was one of the spots we just HAD to hit up. Â Damn. Not only was it 92 degrees out but we waited in line for 60 minutes -_- ...and I'm already tan as it is but my shit was burnt after that haha The location of the restaurant is right underneath the BK Bridge which is pretty cool though :) Anyways... I didn't really know what to expect with ""authentic new york"" style pizza...I've had versions of it in Seattle, but I was excited to finally try the real thing! Â We ended up ordering a sausage & pepperoni and tasted pretty good! Â You can tell they used fresh ingredients and the brick oven makes it taste cleaner! lol I won't front...after waiting that long and hearing all the hype about this place I expected the pizza to blow me away...but it was just OK to me...comparable to places in seattle like tutta bella and piecoras.... All in all, it was an experience to wait that long but it's cool to be able to say I've ate at a famous place like this. Â Will I ever go again? Â Probably not. lol",1
"The food here is delicious and authentic, and going downstairs in some nondescript building in Midtown East to find Sakagura feels extremely Japan-esque to me. I've only been for lunch, but the lunch deals here are fantastic. The other day I had the soba special, which consisted of cold or hot soba and a rice bowl of eel and cucumbers. The eel was the freshest I'd had outside of Japan--maybe they import? Anyway, very fresh and make a note to visit the bathroom when you visit - it's in a giant sake barrel!",1
"The price is right and the food is always good (veggie dumplings and sesame pancakes are my jam). The only thing that makes me sad is that they don't have shrimp or chicken sesame pancakes at this location like they do at the one on 14th, boo! But still a great place to get a cheap, delicious bite. Space isn't too big like the one on 14th, so can get crowded easily and you may feel like you're sitting on top of other people, but it's an opportunity to make a friend (maybe? if they won't eat your brains).",1
"Rounding out the Totto mafia (ramen and soba), Yakitori Totto was solid, solid izakaya fare. Â Lunch was reasonably priced as well (at least for NYC standards) and my friend and I were able to get two lunch combos, a few additional skewers and a beer each for around $65 all in. Service here is typically Japanese, i.e. unfailingly polite and precise. Â The food was really tasty too: Â all of the chicken was tender and juicy, the miso soup wasn't too salty like you find at lower end establishments and even the Sapporo draft that they had was poured with an inch of head at the top. Â Visions of Bill Murray in mascara and a tuxedo decrying, ""For relaxing times... Â make it... Â Suntory time"". Â Goddamn Japanese are so good at everything. Or are they? Â My buddy and I had arrived around 1:35 and the employees seemed extremely adamant that we vacate the premises at 2:15, a scant 15 minutes after their 2:00pm lunch closing time. Â Having been in the restaurant industry myself, I realize that it's a pain in the ass to have customers come in so late to closing time, but it's just a part of doing the teeth gnashing business of slinging hash. Â So it was to my surprise that the once polite Japanese servers were saying, ""You need to go in 10 minutes."" Â  I was a little put-off - especially because of the ultra-Japanese politeness once invoked - but then I remembered that Japan was once a warrior nation colonizing many Asian countries under its Nipponese boot. Â And so being the good Korean colonials that we are, my friend and I hastened to finish while muttering ""Gochisou"" with full mouths as we were shepherded out. Â  Still, some damn solid yakitori...",1
"Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. Â You cannot go wrong with this place. Â  Great hamburger. Â The fries I think are better then the ones I had in Belgium. Â  The mussels MariniÃ¨res is really good. Â If your order this, do your self a favor and dip your bread in the broth. Â All you can eat mussels on Wednesday's. My favorite brunch meal is the Croque Madame. Â Open face ham, cheese and egg sandwich. Â Best part is breaking the egg yolk so you get a bit of it with every bite. Great selection of Belgium beer. Â Half off on Monday's.",1
"Weird. I was literally in shock when I ate takeout from here at how bad the tacos were. And I know tacos. They are my favorite food and I am from California. I got three tacos (pretty sure pastor, asada, and carnitas). They were all insanely greasy and not flavorful! I was so disappointed. I will say the tortilla chips were to die for. Guacamole was good as well but with tacos that I would not order again, I can't give three stars. I might go back if I'm in the area in the hopes that the cook was just on something horrid that night, but idk. Super sad.",1
"Tofu seafood stew 2.50 + rice 1.00. Cheap, delicious and filling meal. My personal favorite! Love how they're open til late. Some of their other premade foods are kinda unappetitizing though.",1
"Came here to celebrate my 1 year wedding anniversary and I could not think of a more delicious restaurant to go to. The prices were decent for all the pallet tingling foods they had to offer. We went for the Prefix menu: Vellutata Â - this was amazing, the soup was sweet and the lobster was crisp, sweet and fresh. Crudo di Passera - Fluke was very fresh, the caviar and the lemon really did the job. Trofie Nero - squid ink pasta with scallops - was so delicious, my first time eating squid ink pasta and it was very flavorful. Spaghetti - had bits of crab and was such a nice spin on the normal spaghetti you would think of eating. Tagliata - Cooked to perfection - meet was very tasty and moist. Astice - Lobster again was amazing - so tasty, sweet and fresh. Crostata di Cioccolato - Amazing, I a huge dark chocolate fan - so this dessert was up my alley - they also make homemade pear sorbet that was to die for. I wish I was able to buy a tub of the pear sorbet. Torta di Olio - This was very delicious as well. But I still have favoritism with the pear sorbet Not only was he food delicious but the service was superb. I would love to go again for another special occasion. I cant wait. =) One more thing - they change there menu every season, so one can only hope to go here at least 4 times in one year.",1
"Total five stars. No complaints, everything was perfect and so tasty. Service was excellent and totally friendly. Also, prices were extremely reasonable and spot on. I left feeling extremely satisfied in all aspects of life. Ok I digress, let me get into what we had. My best friend and I were catching up in NYC (super jet setter like that) we made reservations on a friday night (a MUST) and brought a bottle of wine and champagne (HELLO BYOB). There isn't a corkage fee either. We started with the mussels and the escargot. then well be went for escargot round two (you will need plenty of bread so soak up the deliciousness and don't pretend to be all carb conscious) and then the duck. They serve it with veggies and they are endless and my best veggies were the carrots and the taro root. I felt so welcomed and respected at this establishment and my best friend and I were able to catch up for hours no pressure. In the end the bill came and we were pleasantly surprised. Like I said everything was perfect. No pretension, no rush. bottom line recommend",1
"Ahh, the elusive Pok Pok. Â When can you go here and not have to worry about a 4 hour wait? Â The answer to that question is: Tuesday's at 9pm. Â Don't go with a group either. Thankfully we had access to a car because getting there without one can be kind of inconvenient. Â  Though still crowded when we arrived, we sat down right away and started perusing the menu. Â Service was incredible from start to finish, with our waiter displaying tremendous knowledge of the menu and attentiveness throughout the meal. Â Just like Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street, waiters at Pok Pok all help each other out, serving food, filling water, cleaning the table and checking in to make sure you have everything you need, all with a smile. Â 5 stars for service here. I'm giving Pok Pok a 4 star rating and not 5 because one of the dishes we had was just really not good. Â The dish I'm speaking of is the smoky grilled eggplant. Â The dish is served exactly as advertised on the menu (the menu here is very detailed and rightfully so) so I don't know why we were expecting something different, but the flavors just didn't come together for us. Â It's served cold which we weren't expecting ( that tidbit was not mentioned) and the eggplant was kind of mushy, perhaps overcooked? Â One of the ingredients is dried shrimp which are very small and something that I'd feed to my fish. Â I didn't know they were for human consumption as well. Â Neither of us were a fan of this dish. Â  The Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar) had great flavor but man was it spicy. Â I like spicey food a lot but this was a little more than I could handle. Â For $15, it's a very small portion but any more and I think my tongue would have disintegrated. Â I couldn't get enough of the lime garlic sauce that it's served with and despite the pain I was dealing with, I kept dipping my rice into it. Â I would recommend this dish but buyer beware. Â If you can't take the heat, stay out of the Muu Paa Kham Waan! Of course, we got Ike's famous fish sauce wings (spicy) which are just incredible. Â They are so crispy, yet incredibly moist. Â I've never had a wing like this before and I doubt you have either. Â You can't come here (or WSL) and not order them. Â  Because it was just the two of us and we weren't that hungry, we only ordered these three things. Â I definitely want to go back and try more because I liked most of the dishes at WSL better than these so I think I just need to explore the menu more. Â It's worth coming back again and again, just for the wings. Â And if you come during a heavy traffic hour, just eat at WSL across the street. Â You will not be disappointed and you can get the wings there too.",1
"Definitely 4 stars. Sat at the counter after a Half hour wait. Busy small place but they keep track of who's waiting really well. Love the varied menu and can't beat great breakfast served all day. Heuvos rancheros, 3 egg omelet with spinach, onions and pulled pork. Bloody Mary's, strong coffee and cool guy serving the counter. Will definitely come from queens again!",1
"Delicious! Â Finally got to check out this place, and it did NOT disappoint. Â It was much bigger on the inside than I expected from walking past it hundreds of times. Â The outdoor seating area could use some mosquito repellent in the summer, but the ambiance was relaxed and enchanting. Â  The food was superb, reasonably priced and very decently portioned (and I get judgy when it comes to portions). Â The spicy guac had just the right kick, and their tacos were fresh and filled to the brim, as were the crab tostadas. Â I'll have to come back and try the enchiladas, which looked like a smothered mound of goodness (my friend demolished it with relish). Â  Definitely one of the best tasting of the LIC/Hunters Point restaurants I've tried so far.",1
"Yum! Â Yum! Â Yum! Â  Let's be serious. Â If you want to get to me, you gotta get through my stomach. Â And if you want to get to my stomach, know that I love all these pasta. Â You with me so far? Â Okay. Â  So Udon is pasta (rice flour based but still...) and I love it! Â And Udon West does it right (in various combinations varying from Beef and Kimchi Udon to simple Mountain Vegetables Udon). Â This time, I opted for cold Udon noodles with bonito flakes, mushrooms, etc. in a cold fish broth. Â The portion was a bit small for me (I was hungry!) but it was yummy either way. Â The gouza is a must order as well as the potato salad. Â And please note...this place is BYOB so if you're into that, it's a very good thing to know. So, what have we learned besides how to get to know me better....hmmm....Udon West is a great option if you like Japanese food and are near Grand Central/Midtown East. Â Go! Â Go! Â Go! Oh, and the decor is cute. Â (It's a plus for me!)",1
"I have to say, I'm not impressed at all. The portions were tiny for the price you pay for your meal. I came here twice (The first time was because everyone was raving about this place and the second time was for a friend's birthday). I have probably ordered everything on that menu already. I prefer Traif in Williamsburg. It's a lot more trendy and the foods are better. Reviews on Foods: 1) Foie gras - Impressed actually. It wasn't your typical liver paste, but was shaved and melted in your mouth. One thing I actually did enjoy. 2) Oxtail Terrain - dry and hard 3) Branzino Fish - very fishy taste to it. 4) Meatballs - Typical 5) Fried Chicken - very greasy 6) Buttermilk panna cotta and lychee ice cream (strong taste) 7) Thai Ice Tea Ice Cream (A MUST TRY, DELICIOUS) 8) Scallops (3 pieces, good but wasn't worth it) 9) Steak (average)",1
"I have been a fan of Ippudo in the East Village so much that coming here was a big disappointment. Â  The food is not as good or tastefully prepared. Â I always get the same thing: the Akamaru Modern. Â I love the black mushrooms and the black mushroom oil that sits on top of the broth. Â When I ordered it here, the mushrooms were there but the dark oil was gone...so disappointing. The restaurant seemed to have utilized every square foot of the area with seating and tables and the brightness of the place made it seem not as personalized. Â The staff and management were very rude to our large party and were just eager to have us out of the restaurant as soon as possible. Â  I know that there's a long wait since everyone who's anyone wants to eat here, but when you're sacrificing ambiance and a polite wait staff who want to make your experience as enjoyable as possible, why even bother... All in all, they hate you. Â They want to take your money and rush you to your next engagement like a pig to a slaughterhouse.",1
love the fries and sauces!!! it may not be a fancy place but they know how to make a fry. Â Great place to grab a quick bite before going out or right after!,1
"Excellent beer selection but what is up with ""no kids after 7 pm""? Seemed a bit arbitrary for a Saturday night but whatever. The atmosphere is relaxed in only the way Brooklyn can be relaxed. It's a great gathering place to watch football (both Euro and American). Have to fight for seats but again it's BK so there isn't that much fighting either.",1
"Wow, just wow. The sushi here is the best I've had anywhere (note: never been to Japan). It's fun sitting at the bar and having the sushi chef make each individual sushi for us. I want to take my mom here!",1
"First, to appreciate a restaurant, you always have to understand its name. Pio Pio means chirp or cheep. It's a sound that baby chickens make. Now with that said, I came here with 3 friends at 6pm Sunday and ordered: Chicken Pio - TENDER - SUPER TENDER AND MOIST - simply delicious - salty and slightly crunchy skin - sauce was not exactly spicy, but carried some heat (think it has pepper, onion and garlic), goes very well with the chicken Lomo Saltado - tender beef but chewier than chicken pio - reminded me of stir-fried steak - the fries soaked up the sauce and was amazingly flavorful Mero Con Salsa De Mango - slightly rough texture - mango sauce was sweet, slightly spicy and very refreshing Mixed Steam Vegetables - a small plate of simply steamed vegetable - not worth $7 since you can get $4 frita The food and atmosphere experience was as Pio Pio as it could get. There were a lot of families here. We saw kids running around and adults sipping sangria. The kitchen had no door and we saw waiters walking in and out and heard pans clinging with the stove. The music seemed to be 1970s music and the decoration was very homely (bright colors, red bricks). And most food were slow roasted, or steamed, so it felt healthy and substantial like home food. We felt like children when we were there and we even played with its name for a bit. ""Have you tried Pio Pio?"". ""I like Pio Pio!"". ""Wanna Pio Pio with me?"" (by then we felt the conversation was getting weird so we stopped) However, I don't really understand why Pio Pio has mozzarella pio or salmon del pio, because if if Pio is the sound a baby chicken make, then does mozzarella pio mean baby cheese and salmon del pio mean baby salmon? But baby cheese and baby salmon don't pio (chirp or cheep). I also don't understand why do they have Peruvian style Chinese fried rice. So is it like Americanized Chinese food, but Peruvianized? Service was slow, and they don't take more than 3 cards, but it was still an overall enjoyable experience.",1
"CHICKEN SOUP, CHICKEN ADOBO, HALO-HALO SPECIAL DECOR: It's a small cute restaurant that can barely fit 10-14 customers. The restaurant looks like a dive. FOOD: We ordered the chicken soup (appetizer), chicken adobo with garlic rice (entree) and halo-halo special (dessert). Everything was very tasty and the portion were large. The enter order was too much for the two of us. The chicken soup contains rice vermicelli and boiled eggs too. Chicken adobo comes with white rice but you can ask them to replace it with garlic rice (instead of ordering garlic rice separately). The chicken comes with bone-in. Halo-Halo comes with or without ice-cream. Halo- Halo Special is with ice-cream and we ordered a scoop of the Uber flavored ice-cream (It's violet color ice-cream as you can see in the picture). Halo-Halo is a mixture of jellies, nuts, fruits, milk/coconut milk and crushed ice and one halo-halo can be easily shared by two people. SERVICE: Our order came within 10 mins from the time ordered. The waiter was polite and humble. PRICE: Reasonable. Our total was $30/- I do recommend this place for Filipino cuisine.",1
"Get here early on the weekends!! We were here at 9:30 am for Sunday brunch, and the wait was already 1.5 hours. By the time we were seated, at around 11, the wait became 3 hours! The good thing is that you can leave a phone number with them, and the restaurant will text you when your table is ready. They also have this neat app that shows how many parties are ahead of you in line, so that if you decide to take a walk in the neighborhood to pass the time (which is what we did because ... who is going to stand outside the restaurant for 1.5 hours??), you at least have an idea of when to get back. The food here is amazing!! I ordered one of their specials, the Southern hash, which includes your choice of eggs, potatoes, ground chorizo, roasted peppers, and corn. This place definitely knows how to cook eggs over medium. Whenever I order my eggs over medium, I usually get eggs that are actually over easy, and then when I start eating it, the yolk runs all over my plate and creates this yellow, gooey mess of a breakfast. Not here though. The eggs I had were cooked just the right amount - soft and runny but when you slice open the egg, the yolk doesn't start running all over your food. The jalapeÃ±o hollandaise sauce that came on top of the hash was a great touch. Boyfriend got the huevos rancheros, which was vegetarian and recommended by our waitress. The huevos rancheros here is not like your typical huevos rancheros though. The tortilla was hard, not soft. Also, it came with guacamole and jalapeÃ±o sour cream - yum! The only complaint BF had was that the egg-to-tortilla ratio was a little off; he recommends adding another egg. Sad to say, I didn't get a chance this time to try their famous pancakes. I'll definitely be going back ... maybe during Pancake Month!!",1
"Not to sound like a broken record, but Kefi has the best lamb burger I've ever had. Even if you are not a fan of lamb you should try your friend/spouse/partner/family's order of lamb burger. Its deliciousness is definitely due to the magical spice blend (I taste some cumin, among others) they mix into the meat patties. I've also never had another lamb burger as succulent and juicy as this one. It comes with a side salad and potato chips, and while the former is a fresh, light compliment to the burger, the chips are nothing special. Then, of course, get the octopus over chickpeas. I'm a fan of all seafood in general, but I don't think I've ever had grilled octopus as soft and tender as Kefi's. It was generously seasoned (a bit too salty for me but probably perfect for the average palate), flavorful, and has beautiful grill marks. The sheep's milk dumplings + spicy lamb sausage + pine nuts was also really yummy! I've never had anything like it before - not exactly gnocchi, not exactly a ""dumpling,"" but so soft and melty. The lamb sausage was the perfect companion to up the flavor component, and was in a realm of its own and different from the lamb burger. If you call ahead to make a reservation, you'll get seated in the spacious, well-lit downstairs portion of the restaurant, which, in my opinion, beats the darker, noisier, and colder upstairs portion. The service was knowledgeable, warm, and friendly. I want to try their seafood next!",1
"I came here a long time ago and remember liking the lobster. I came back recently and ordered the Gumbo soup, 6 clams, and mussels. The gumbo was super watery and tasted like just herbs and water, the shrimp and chicken in the soup was super overcooked and flavorless. The clams weren't clean and fresh, there was sand in it. The mussels was okay, but overcooked for my taste. I also ordered the Lobster whipped potatoes and wow.... that was a very sad side dish, sure there were bits of lobsters in it but the potatoes taste like it was from an instant mash potato mix and the orange-brown sauce that they put on the potato had a very unappealing color and was rather flavorless The whole experience was underwhelming and I would not come back here again.",1
"Ichibantei...I put this on my ""to-do"" list a year ago but only now did I ""happen by"" it and went in. So as you can tell by any of the other reviews, this is Japanese ""comfort food,"" meaning lots of savory dishes. My bf and I came here after having a few drinks at Keybar down the street, and ""comfort food"" always satisfies drunken munchies! I was surprised that it wasn't very busy on this warm Saturday night. It was mostly young couples on dates? We were the only white people being served, which also surprised me. Â I enjoyed the chill vibe they had going on... reggae music playing and reggae memorabilia decorating the space. On to the food...the chicken karaage is definitely the highlight! Fried, but still tender and juicy on the inside. The tonkatsu was really good, too. All entrees over $12 come with miso soup, rice, and vegetables, so you get a quite a lot of food! It's not a bad deal at all! Be warned: It's CASH ONLY. Hit that ATM before coming!",1
"I have found my newest love in life. Mooncake foods. Look its not about their sauces being so good you could slather it on a rotting cadaver and it would be delish, its not about their flavors being so unique that its like taking your taste buds to six flags, its about that after you stuff yourself for under 13 bucks, you also feel proud of how healthy you ate. Guilt free (for both your calorie count and wallet) , filling, and tasty...the holy restaurant trinity.",1
usually a savory type of breakfast eater but the BLUEBERRY PANCAKES were delish! Â wasn't too sweet but oozed with the natural berry flavor...portion was generous. Â GRITS were yummy too. Â the wait for this place can get out of control and they don't take reservations for brunch.,1
Brilliant food (went for brunch) and super cute environment - enjoyed the sundeck seating.,1
"Had brunch at Freeman's last Sunday and surprisingly had no issues getting a table for two for a walk-in at 11am (an hour after opening). Overall the food is really good. I had ordered the TWO POACHED EGGS w/ GRITS with a side of bacon and my boyfriend, the EGG SKILLET. My dish had great flavor, especially the roasted tomato. My only minor deductions were preferences really. I would have like the yolks over easy instead of over-medium and the choice in cheese over my grits; i would have like a cheddar grated thinly (something more creamy) than the Gruyere (more nutty). The side of bacon consisted on three pieces which to be honest was a little too crispy, there was barely any meat flavor to suck out of them. If there's anything notable about Freeman's it would definitely be A: the cocktails and B: their hospitality. We sat down, food was served, and devoured by 11:30, and really wanted to wait for 12 noon (NYC law on Sundays) to hit so that we could order cocktails. While waiting, a hostess came up to us asking if we could kindly move from our table so that patrons could be sat for dining and she in turn would give us seats near the bar. Having agreed to do so she said that for our cooperation, we would get free mimosas. MOVE ME ANY DAY!",1
"Good soup dumplings, tried two other dishes and it was ok, but worth the trip for the dumplings.",1
"I don't care how decent their food is. I never give restaurants one star-- that's just harsh. But not this time. This time. OOH. Nyonya, you're going to get it. When I thought Nyonya's sister chain in eighth avenue had bad service, I had no idea how much worse this restaurant's service would be. It was cramped, chaotic, loud. Servers are stumbling around, spilling drinks everywhere, speaking in informal Chinese, not paying mind to anything around them. Â If I'm going to pay for a Manhattan priced meal, don't talk to me like I'm in a fried dumpling joint. We're squished into this ridiculously tiny table-- all our 10+ guests, to the point where we cannot prop both elbows on the table without overlapping each other. The table's filthy, and they never changed our teas, even though we had attempted to flag them down multiple times. I'm never coming here again. In my eyes, the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown trumps this one any day.",1
"This was a great neighborhood find. Â I was so happy to see it has all organic produce and cage-free animals. Â Trying to eat health is not easy, let alone finding a restaurant that is on the same page. Â I got a burger and fries that was very tasty and fresh. Â The service was quick. Â This place loses a star because it is very small and noisey. Â All and all I will be back.",1
"It's tight and it's yummy. No it's not what you think. Â I'm talking about this nice little neighborhood gem. Â BYOB is always a plus - but frankly I'm a fan of their delicious Sunday brunches. Â My lady ordered the omelette and I had the eggs benedict. Â Both were above average and definitely gave us plenty of reasons to come back. Â But keep in mind, the place is tiny and you'll be dining in close quarters. Â Also plan on a solid wait unless you get there on the earlier side, so definitely keep that in mind before you head out. Â  My only qualm was the so-so service. Â The wait staff was hard to find and people weren't exactly the most friendly. Â But then again, it's a tiny place with a tiny staff. Â With people waiting to be served or asking when their tables are ready, I can see why it's not easy to be exactly chipper at all times. Â  Nonetheless, if you're in Hell's Kitchen and you're looking for a good go-to brunch spot, definitely keep this place in mind. Â You won't be disappointed. Â Prices here are also reasonable relative to what you get, so that's another plus.",1
"One of our Go-To Places in the East Village. For Brunch, Dinner, whatever meal, this place is SO GOOD. Being Filipino, I think I have pretty hard expectations for a Modern Filipino restaurant, but this place does not disappoint. I personally love coming for dinner because of the Kare Kare, but my boyfriend would rather come during Brunch for the Fried Chicken and Ube Waffles or the Silog dishes. Have to Get Brunch: Sigsig, Fried Chicken and Ube Waffles, Longsilog Have to Get Dinner: Sigsig, Kare Kare, Sinigang Downside: Must make a reservation, otherwise you are looking at sitting at bar if open or waiting an hour plus.",1
"Relaxed dive bar with cheap beer. Â On a Tuesday night, its pretty slow. I can see it being a ton of fun on the weekends.",1
"Boo. Â Seriously, foodie friends? Â Let us stand in solidarity on the mediocrity of this place. Over priced, uninspired and yet packed all the time. Â With so many better options in the area, why would you go here? Â Oh yeah.... the name. Buns are probably the only reason to go. Â But come on.... Noodle Shop it if you are dedicated to the name or just head to Baohaus around the corner. Â Do not spring for dessert (pre prepped and not even as good as heading across the street to Milk Bar). Pass it by on your way to better food. Â You will thank me later.",1
"It is a really nice place with great service, delicious food, and chic decor. Try the ribs for sure- it was AMAZING.",1
"In general, I think it's absurd to wait in a long line for french fries - and pretty much without fail, there is a huge line coming out of this place at all times. That being said - the fries here are solid - crispy, large cut, served fresh. love that they have free sauces with tabasco and ""pretentious"" yet awesome mayo ;) the hidden gem for me here is poutine. some people might hear ""gravy"" ""cheese curds"" ""fries"" and say ""gross"" - to them I say, bite your tongue... gooey cheese goodness, heavy set gravy... it doesn't get any more American than that...(or Canadian, but whatever...) anyways, 4 stars.",1
"Just wanted to point out that the $16.50 I mentioned is including tax. Was probably a little harsh earlier in saying $16.50 isn't a steal. In comparing to Maine, I forgot that RHLP has to actually ship the lobsters down from Maine...that's obviously why lobster rolls in Maine are cheaper. Added one star in light of that revelation and this place's service. WIll give them another shot sometime in the near future.",1
nothing is better than feed your stomach in the 2am morning then watch the beautiful scene of Times sq,1
"Stumbled upon this place while walking around on a Saturday night. They had a late night happy hour special of $5.00 beers. It's pretty spacious and has two rooms with more tables in the back. The music was all classic hip hop with a lot of Jay-Z hits on rotation. The beers were different and not the typical sort that you find in most bars. They have the dessert menu on the back of the drink list- not sure if they serve sweets at night, but it's worth asking. The service was good and the people seemed very laid-back. Loved the vibe. The bathroom was pretty dirty, but what do you expect at a NYC bar. I would definitely go back and try an actual drink next time.",1
"In the sea of Hells Kitchen Thai restaurants, Pure is definitely the tops in terms of unique options (no pad thai to be found), but offers plenty of other deliciousness. Â My favorite is the dry noodles with pork and crab - slightly sweet, salty and amazing. Â Vegetarian dumplings are tender and wonderful and the Thai iced tea is perfection washing everything down. Â The wait times can be tough so recommended for smaller groups only.",1
Wow! Â We found this place by accident and it was well worth the trip across town! Â The food was exceptional. (Apps - Mushroom Cigars and Cauliflower Soup were favorites/ Entrees - double cut pork chop special and filet mignon were favorites). We even gorged ourselves by sharing 3 different desserts. All were great but the peanut butter pie was to die for! It's BYOB so we brought a couple bottles of beautiful wine to enjoy. The waiter (Ramon) was very fun and friendly. He was proud to work there and it was obvious. Thanks for a great meal!,1
"Pretty good food, not the best I've had but it was good. We had the 3 meat combination platter...the kofte was our favorite (Ground beef/lamb kebab). The chicken ""shawarma"" was sort of the same as the chicken kebab - just cut into smaller pieces. Almost tasted like it had the same seasoning as the other chicken so I was kind of disappointed in that - wish I would have known before ordering. Â The chicken was OK, just tasted like it was rubbed in some spice blend, so it was nothing special. Â The hummus was very good and so was the rice with lentils. The middle eastern hot sauce on the side was also tasty and spicy (had a hint of aleppo pepper) - just the way we like it. Overall a good experience, pretty quick service and decent food.",1
"I went for brunch. The place looks lovely and the service is excellent. They serve pour over coffee, which is pretty cool. I has the omelette with goat cheese and tomatoes, which was a little blend if I want to be honest. The eggs benedict with roasted pork was OK. The French toast was also ok but the peanut butter inside made it a little too heavy to my taste.",1
great food and and very nice to eat in,1
"What a gem! I'd been to their Bar Jamon, next door, for drinks but had no idea this awesome, Michelin star (as of 2014) tapas haven existed in our neighborhood. We made reservations the day Michelin released their 2014 list and, wow, both food and service at this tiny restaurant were phenomenal. Â Its odd that Mario Batali is a co-owner; I've always associated him with everything Italian but this place rightfully deserves a star! Everything we ordered was delicious but items that stood out were- Buffalo's Milk Burrata with Saffron Oranges and Toast (a must!), Lamb Leg with Salted Spanish Chocolate Sauce and the bread pudding dessert.",1
Chicken. Biscuits. Beignets. Big scary cook whipping up the most delicious food. Only down side: I wish these sandwiches were bigger.,1
"I came to Nyonya with my friend for dinner Tuesday night. I got seats first and waited for her for about 5 minutes or so and I was looking at the menu. Surprisingly, nobody asked if I wanted to order or if I needed anything yet. Anyways, my friend came and we looked at the menu for another 5 minutes and the waiter took our order. I ordered the Thai iced tea (and yes, a Thai drink at a Malaysian restaurant...lol). For my meal, I ordered the Seafood Egg Chow Fun. My friend ordered the rombutan iced drink and the Hainanese Chicken over Rice. We also ordered the roti canai to share. The drinks and roti canai came in a decent amount of time. Considering I haven't seen my friend in a long time, we spent a lot of time catching up so we probably didn't know it was taking long even if it did...haha. The roti canai was not good at all. It was crispy and crunchy and it falls apart when I touch it. I've had a lot better roti canai at other places like in Queens that are soft and crispy and doesn't fall apart! Not sure why when I have roti canai in Chinatown, they're not good at all! Anyways, my friend's Hainanese Chicken over Rice came about 10-15 minutes later. And we were waiting for my food and thought it was on its way right after my friend's dish came out. Nope! We waited another 15-20 minutes and the waitresses said twice that the Seafood Egg Chow Fun is coming. It was like deja vu again at another restaurant I was at and they kept saying it was coming. Anyways, we're thinking like this better be worth the wait. And guess what, it was the same as any other Malaysian restaurant. It's nothing new or special. It did taste good, don't get me wrong. I thought it was just us that felt like we were waiting for our food forever! No, the two other tables next to us on either side were taking forever to wait for their dessert and the other table was waiting for their first dish and kept asking for water they never got. Anyways, I really do not know how this restaurant got all those Zagat ratings for like the past like 10 years that is hung up on their wall in the entryway! And I definitely do not know how they got Michelin rating too! That is appalling! There are way better restaurants that deserve these ratings! And they may be small mom and pop shops, but the service is way better and the food is way better and cheaper too! This restaurant is overrated and I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here. It is a tourist trap given the number of tourists in this restaurant.",1
Greasy and gross and disappointing :(,1
Five Spice Pork Belly. That is all you need to know.. Delicious and not too oily at all compared to some other rival sandwich places....and those few slices of pickled pear in there oh my !!!! Next time I gotta try the catfish and tiger shrimp.,1
Great pancakes!!!!,1
"I lived very locally to this place for a while, went there the first week it was open and checked in periodically ever since. Ben and Jen are great and it has been terrific to see them grow, change,adapt and get publicity for it. I'm far from vegetarian, and not a cheese fan, but their food is amazing. The soups are absolutely delicious. They always have a VERY interesting beer selection. There are beers I've only heard of/seen as a result of the kickshaw. Because the beers are craft/unique - some can be very expensive. But good selection. There is nothing worse than a craft beer bar featuring 30 different IPA's and nothing else and kickshaw has enough variety for all tastes and preferences. It can get very busy (read:packed full of hipsters) during shows. This isn't a good time to get the full kickshaw experience. Zach is an awesome bartender. Most of the staff is cool - they had a couple disgruntled cooks that weren't there long and a couple disgruntled waitresses but last I was there everything seemed to have smoothed out. I can't speak intelligently on the coffee. I dont know enough about it to give an opinion as to why its better there than other places. I had a cup from their tap before and it tasted good, but im more of a 'large turbo ice' from dunkin kind of guy - so im more about the size/caffeine than where the bean is from and how its brewed. People do seem to enjoy their coffee though.",1
"I have walked here a billion times and never realized this is where five leaves is located. Â Great corner outdoor spot. Â Everything we ate was really tasty. Â The bacon covered dates were good, but I would suggest making the plate look a little prettier. Â The ceviche on the other hand was really delicious and absolutely beautiful. Â It was fresh - i could have eaten 10 of them. Â The steak main is absolutely huge so you definitely don't have to worry about going hungry, and the potatoes that come with are buttery. Â The arctic char was cooked perfectly and was really delicious. Â Minus the one star for the not so friendly hostess. Â She warmed up a bit at the end, but catty is never cool in my books.",1
"My wrap was completely underwhelming. Stay away! Expensive to top it all off for ""fast food""",1
"This place is my new addiction. Spanish cured meat is so delicious. I recommend coming in on Wednesdays when all sandwiches are only $1. I also really like the mix cured meat from Spain platter. They give you a little bit of everything and it comes with warm, toasty bread. You wrap the cured meat with the warm bread and it's amazing. They make really good french fries too! Their fries are crispy and potato-y. Get them with the ali oli and the brava sauce!",1
"This is a great little hideaway! Â Without the sign in the lobby, it took us awhile to find it, just ask the security guard and he's more than happy to point you in the right direction. Â Love the homemade noodles and the interesting smaller plates that usually accompany the meal. Â Its perfect in terms of portions and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket when you leave. Â  Desserts were so-so, but I did enjoy the Chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. Â One other perk that I as a man couldn't experience was the electronic japanese toilet in the ladies room. Â If its working, definitely give it a spin....I would.",1
"This is another ""Disco Review"" (written from a partially sober recollection). Mother's Ruin seems trendy and somewhat sceney, full of pleasant-looking people. There's a good selection of drinks (I abstained due to a current diet), and although pretty crammed when we passed by earlier in the night, the crowd thinned by 2 or 3 am, allowing a more laid-back table experience with friends. Probably more fun for the under-30 set, but a fun place to cap off the night for the young and young at heart:)",1
I wasn't expecting much from this place. We were looking for a decent priced place to grab something to eat because we were starving and it was a weekday and most restaurants didn't open late night. Â We stopped here and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the carne asada burritos and cheese nachos. Â I shared it with my friend and we were stuffed! I loved how they give you free chips and their salsa is soooooooo hot and good. Â My stomach paid for it later tho. lol,1
"Little Collins is indeed a small little coffee shop hiding in Midtown. Â I haven't tried their coffee yet but they add foam art to their customers' lattes! Â I'm definitely coming back to get myself one of those. For sandwiches (~$10 each), I've tried their House Cured Salmon, Sauteed Shrooms (with avocado), and Schnitzel (chicken, hummus, caramelized onions). Â The Salmon sandwich is my favorite! Â I took one bite and was blown away by how tasty and fresh their salmon was! Â Plus, they didn't skimp out on it like some places do. Â The Shrooms and Schnitzel were yummy and flavorful as well. For dessert, I've tried their olive oil bread and the Sweet Uncle Fred (banana bread, walnuts, honey, fruits, ricotta topping). Â They were both moist yet held itself together well as you chewed through the soft texture. If you can find a seat, go for it. Â They have 4 high tables for two and a small area (another 4 seats) by the window. Â Otherwise, take the food to go and enjoy!",1
"Can't beat it! Please don't go. Â I want it all to myself. Â And yes, the people are pretty cool. Â If I could wish for one thing, it would be to have some single malt scotch on hand. Â Great bar to lay back with a scotch. And maybe turn down the music just a little bit. Other than that--great f-in place!",1
super good steaks and surprisingly good brunches--i really dig this place and the atmosphere.,1
"French fries are tasty, lamb sausage is great. Turkish coffee smells good, I will come back and try it.",1
"As a tourist, this place was on the top of our ""touristy things to do in NYC"". Yes, the pizza was good BUT after being stuck in New York for a week (thanks Sandy) we stopped acting like tourists and fell in love with delicious and authentic New York pizza served at non-touristy, hole-in-the-wall, cheap and not so highly reviewed local spots in Soho, Greenwich and Manhattan. Lombardi's was way too busy and our pizza took forever to come out. The staff indifferent and the place was packed with tourists. We ordered an original margarita and it was good, but not drool-will-see-it-in-my-dreams good. I am glad I got to try this place out once because it's one of those ""to do's"" but I think I'll just keep it at that...""once""...",1
"We stopped in here only because it was on Yelp's Smith Street Classic hit list, and boy am I glad Hunter's was on the list. We even came back after finishing the round! Upon entering, the casual and hip vibe immediately drew us in. It was fairly crowded for a weeknight but my friend Nathan and I found two stools at the bar. The bartenders and waitstaff were all dressed in cute Halloween themed hunter and animal costumes. So fun and laid back (and we got to steal their costume ideas shhh!). The bartenders were extra friendly and gave us their special Smith Street Classic contest cocktail. I don't remember what it was called, but I voted it the best cocktail and best bar! The drink did have Green Hook Gin and LeJay Creme de Cassis. Just ask for the special with that! Their other specialty cocktails reference hunters and animals (Katness Everdeen, Rusty Bulleit...). Since we still had other bars to go to, we reluctantly gave up our bar stools. Upon returning later, it was almost as if they reserved them for us LOL. Anyway, we had more cocktails and beer, and ordered amazing truffle fries and roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon. The sprouts were excellent! I had to take a photo for Yelp. I hated my mom's sprouts as a kid, but they weren't roasted like Hunter's. And I'm sure mom didn't add bacon. Last weekend friends moved in a block down Baltic, so we're coming back to Hunter's for sure and trying the dinner menu. Hope the food lives up to the bar standards! So far, Hunter's is my favorite Smith Street bar/restaurant, and it's already a ""classic.""",1
"Delicious food. Â  Bathroom lock on door knob didn't work. Â When I opened the door, a guy was sitting there and he was like ""ahhhh!"". Â Hope they fixed it. Â Make sure you lock bathroom using the metal hook at the door!!!",1
"So happy my cousin introduced me to this hidden gem in the Lower East Side. Â  I never thought a chicken biscuit could taste so good! ...And look so good too. Â With only one bite, I tasted the quality of a freshly baked biscuit, chicken fried to perfection, and an amazing gravy that binds these two in holy matrimony. Â The red cabbage slaw was also a great complement to this sandwich. Â  The guys behind the counter are welcoming and way down to earth. Â It was all laughs when we were there. Â The outhouse and the makeshift crate seats make this hole-in-the-wall legit! Â  Â  Â  This is absolutely another place to look forward to when visiting NYC. Â Good on the wallet too!",1
"SUNDAY NIGHT BURGER AND BEER... a Six Points IPA, a bacon cheddar special sauce medium rare burger and a mound of perfect shoe string fries... Sunday nights do not get better than this. Except if you top it off with the bread pudding and caramelized bananas, walnuts, rum sauce and caramel chocolate chunk ice cream. Oh man.",1
wow. Â awesome fish sandwich.,1
"Is the ramen good? Yes. The service on the other hand, is atrocious. You're a ramen joint. Ramen is meant to be low key, not stuffy. Don't tell me, when I'm sitting at a booth with extra space, that my friend can't join 5 minutes late (because she is stuck at work at nearly 11pm) -- even if I order her ramen right then, along with mine. Don't tell me to make sure I text her this instant that she can't join. You work in a service industry. I get that you have a no add-on policy. But it's late, there aren't that many people left in your restaurant, the space is there, and it doesn't harm you in any way to let my friend literally slide into the booth next to me 5 minutes from now and enjoy some much needed noodles after a long day at work.",1
"I've been to Room Service a few times now and I enjoy this place because of the service, the ambiance, the food, and the cheap prices. Â You can get great cocktails and wines for super cheap and also tasty food (served really quickly). Â The staff is really nice and the decor is awesome. Â This place gets busy, but you can sit at the bar and eat the full menu as well. Â I recommend the curry puffs, super tasty!",1
"What can be said about Ssam Bar that hasn't already been said? Still, I'll give it a go. Went with 8 other people on a Saturday at 11PM (the only time we could get a reservation). Is that too late for dinner? Not at all! We just got the bo ssam ($200), no extras, and barely managed to finish the whole thing. The first bite of pork was unforgettable. The skin had caramelized into a slightly crispy layer of porky goodness. It wasn't too fatty (unlike chicken skin) and the flavors were balanced -- the only downside was that there's only one layer, and it goes fast. Deeper inside, the pork shoulder was tender and easily shredded. The addition of lettuce and sauces is crucial; the marinade doesn't penetrate to every part of the large hunk of meat, which could lead to a slightly repetitive eating experience. The raw oysters added an interesting fishy element, which dollar-oyster enthusiasts will love and the oyster-inexperienced (such as myself) will likely forget as simply one bite out of many. Of the four sauces, ginger-scallion stood out the most. It's a flavor combination more commonly found in Chinese cuisine, but the bright ginger notes and mild oiliness pair well with the robust pork and taste great mixed with the other sauces as well. The ssÃ¤m sauce was a bit of a disappointment: overpoweringly salty and not spicy enough. For Korean-inspired food, the bo ssÃ¤m could've used a kick in the chili department. Lighting is minimal; the brightly lit kitchen casts a short-reaching glow that makes food photography futile. (Inveterate bloggers and Instagrammers should come for lunch.) New York residents should make their way here at least once to get a taste of the real thing before attempting it at home, though I wouldn't deem the restaurant experience imperative for visitors from out of town.",1
"Liked it, but didn't love it. Sat at the bar and had a steak and (quite ) a few glasses of wine. The steak was really good. About 60 dollars but it came without a side. Â You don't get any bread or anything else. So the steak plus a salad and a side comes to about 180 per person (with wine). The place is cool and the crowd is ok (but... a lot of Jersey moms and tourists come here). The service is ""Brooklyn Pretentious,"" with a standard-issue bearded hipster behing the bar, which is typical for any trendy place but still annoying. Â  In sum, it was an ok experience and I may go back at some point, but it is not a place I will add to my list of favorites. That is all.",1
"I had been trying to eat here on three different occasions but small venue + the slow French way of dining + no reservations = many last minute changes of venue to some of the random restaurants near Buvette. But I finally came here on a Monday night and managed to land a table in 10 minutes for 2 people! Their dinner menu is focused on small dishes. I got the salted cod (grandade du morue), which is more like a rich, butter like, spread of pureed cod. Very unique, unfortunately did not spread it thick enough to use up more than half of the jar. I wish they offered a smaller size, but would not order again. Also got the steak tartare, which comes premixed and spread on pieces of bread. Delicious and fresh! I could not get enough of it and would order it again. Finally, got the coq au vin (marinated chicken) - the sauce was very rich and a bit too salty. The meat was tender and falling off the bone, but either I was too full at this point or the saltiness of the sauce turned me off, because I did not enjoy it as much as I would've liked. Service is slow, but it's a very busy restaurant. Venue has a great atmosphere - come here in a party less than 5 or on a date. It's hard to get in, but definitely come at least once.",1
"So far in Chinatown, I have not tried a Vietnamese Pork Sandwich as good as this place! Â I usually order a whole bunch of sandwiches for my family and friends during social gatherings and they all love them as much as I do. Â If you haven't tried the sandwiches here, then you must do so!",1
"My favorite go-to spot for banh mi in Chinatown because the sandwiches are tasty and affordable, the workers are efficient, and the place is clean. Â There is some seating available, but it's mostly a take-out place.",1
"Delightful brunch experience. They don't take reservations, and you can't even put your name down for a table, so you just..wait in line for a table. The man seating was actually very good at it, and so as soon as the third person in our party appeared we were seated. We were inside pressed right against the dessert case. It's not that I have an issue staring into a wall of desserts, but this is definitely a TINY, cramped restaurant. The food was DELICIOUS. I got the eggs norvegian, and it was one of the best eggs-benedict renderings i've ever had. Great smoked salmon. Free tea and coffee for brunch, so that was nice. Can't have both though, which we ruefully pointed out when we received the bill. No one mentioned that to us.. Our waiter was just so French, as in surly and unhelpful. I might have considered him downright mean had I not read reviews on NYmag about the indifferent staff. No matter, it was a delightful brunch with delicious, well-portioned food and such a wonderful, tucked-away location in the West Village.",1
"This is my favorite restaurant in Astoria. I have had every crostini on the menu that does not feature egg salad (Sorry egg salad, I hate you) and they are all above average to amazing. The standouts are the spicy avocado & goat cheese, mushroom truffle butter & dirty chips & Parmesan, and the goat cheese & honey & rosemary oil. They have a different soup special every day - I have had at least 10 varieties and they are all wonderful. Any of their soups involving butternut squash or potato warrants an immediate extra order of soup to eat for lunch tomorrow. I literally high-fived my girlfriend over the table the second I heard ""The soup of the day today is butternut-"" All of the staff here are extremely friendly and helpful - this on top of the food being reasonably priced and ridiculously delicious makes it very easy to become a regular here. Il Bambino, I love you.",1
"Wow! Number one tip for this place: Go here on a Flamenco night and request a table in the dining area to see the flamenco show. Â The flamenco show itself makes this place 5 stars. Â The food on the otherhand is a measly 1 (wah wah wah...). Â I think my favorite food there was the olive oil that came with the bread, but the flamenco and the service is so worth going for. My boyfriend took here for our anniversary; it was an amazing choice. Â We reserved a table for the second flamenco show of the night and arrived to an extremely packed restaurant. Â We had reservations for 10:15 and didn't get seated more towards 10:45 or 11:00. Â It was kind of crazy 'cause there was a large party and they had to kick other people out to accomodate those who had made reservations for the show. I wasn't entirely too happy 'cause we got seated behind another table but it worked out perfectly in the end. Â Once the music started, it didn't matter where I was in the restaurant. The guitarist spoke oceans of emotion with his hands that elegantly strummed his guitar endlessly throughout the night while the flamenco dancers casted their feet to the beat of the music as they spun and twisted their bodies around stage with vigor. Aside from the music/flamenco, we ordered the tapas that Yelp reviewers said were their favorite and ordered a couple of half pitches of sangria. Â The sangrias we got were both good. Â The servic was slow but our waiter was so friendly and nice so I didn't mind. Â Plus, there was a Â really large party so I understood. Â We got an octopus dish, meatballs and empanadas (a seemingly safe choice) but they were all pretty terrible/over salted. Â I could tell they used good ingredients but something just went wrong in the kitchen, multiple times. Â However, flamenco was so good it was really easy to overlook the bad food. I just know for next time not to order food here. In summary-- ultimate power play-- Have dinner beforehand at someplace with better food, come to Nai Tapas Bar for the flamenco show and orders lots and lots of drinks like Sangria to experience the flamenco and the friendly, awesome service.",1
"What a gem! I went for lunch last week and was delighted by the experience. The server (who I believe is the daytime manager) was charming and had a very good understanding of the menu. I told her I couldn't have gluten and she made sure to note gluten intolerance when she placed the order. I had the merguez and eggs, and was able to easily substitute scrambled for the sunny side up listed on the menu. My dining companion had a pasta dish that was dressed in a light cream sauce and I will have to take her word for it that was divine. We finished off the meal with the flourless chocolate cake. It was beautifully presented and brought over to us with two delicate and extremely fragrant glasses of cordial, that went perfectly with our dessert. I am not normally a fan of cordial, as it can be a little too sweet for my palate, but this complemented the cake perfectly. I was excited to see they have what looks to be a great late night weekend menu and also look forward to heading there come winter, having cocktails by the wood burning fire place, while dreaming of warmer times. *Part way through our meal we were hit by a rain storm and so my dining companion and I lingered for a rather long time, which was perfectly okay by the incredibly gracious staff, even though they were obviously setting up for dinner.",1
"Great concept. Cool vibe and semi outdoor seating option. Mediocre execution. The ratio of bread to sandwich fillings is always too bready, the fillings don't seem high quality and the fries/papas Bravas are the best part. Sangria is wine with orange soda or 7up depending on if you order white or red, and overall the culinary experience just isn't very impressive. Â Disappointing considering the vast and amazingly inspired seeming menu.",1
"I know practically all the reviews were 4 or 5's but I can't do it. I don't know if its because I had high expectations or because I've simply had better. First off, looking at their website I had a totally different impression of the place. I thought the place would be much bigger with a younger, more hip crowd, kind of lounge-y. Instead the place was small, warm and cozy which is totally fine just not at all as I expected. Drinks: We started off with cocktails. I had ordered the ginger snap and I don't remember the name of the drink my friend had gotten but it was the first on on the menu. We both thought the drinks were OK. Appetizer: We got the bacon peanut brittle based on reviews and my love for bacon. Again I had a completely different image in my head of what it would look like, I was thinking more along the lines of a bar or bark form. Instead it presented itself in a small glass like beer nuts when you sit at the bar. Aside from the look I thought they were good but not great. It was too nutty, needed more brittle and there was not nearly enough bacon! Disappointing! Food: We had ordered a redhead burger and the fried chicken as it was listed as one of the top 10 best fried chicken in the city. The burger was good but didn't set off any bells and I had ordered it medium but it was quite pink even Aerosmith would agree. However the waffle chips that came with it were very good and different which I liked a lot. The fried chicken was good but once again nothing to write home about. The crunch and saltiness was excellent but the chicken was pretty bland and it could of been a bit juicier but the lack of flavor hurt it the most. I almost forgot, the winner of the night to my surprise were the home made tater tots! These tots were delicious and had kick to them that was devised perfectly. The dessert menu wasn't very convincing so we didn't order any. The bill came out to $80 with tip which isn't terrible but for what we ate I thought it was a bit much. Although the food was good I don't think i'll be back at my own will.",1
":::: ONE MICHELIN STAR | 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 :::: ___________________________________ TIME/DATE: March 3, 2013 @ 2:15pm AMBIANCE: Very small space, expect to rub elbows if you sit at a dining table. We opted to sit at the counter which allows a little more elbow space and, best of all, gives you a direct view of the magic as it happens. (They have an open kitchen concept.) They have one co-ed restroom that's extremely small even for Manhattan standards - possibly 2.5' x 4'. The monkey hook was cute, though. ;-) SERVICE: Quick, friendly. PRICE: $30-$75/person VALUE: We spent $152 before tip on 8 incredible dishes. I've spent more on less at Michelin restaurants that left me wondering if my taste buds were broken. CHANCE OF RETURNING: 100% ___________________________________ :::: [ THE FOOD ] :::: * RAZOR CLAMS A LA PLANCHA - $15 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â yelp.com/biz_photos/casaâ€¦ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - [4/5 - You should only get this if you like garlic.

My husband doesn't like uni at all so my 1.5 croquetas (it came with 3) had double the uni.. which worked out for me. The sauce that they place on the plate before the croquetas was so delicious, I used bread to wipe the plate clean.] * FIDEOS W/CHORIZO AND CLAMS - $18 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â yelp.com/biz_photos/casaâ€¦ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - [4/5 - You have to like clams to enjoy this. My husband, unfortunately, does not. He gave it a 4/10, while I gave it an 8/10. There's barely any chorizo and quite a few clams, which once again worked out for me. Suggestion: take all of the meat out of the clam shells, then mix up the whole dish to get the sauces evenly distributed.] * RABBIT W/ANTICUCHOS AND HABANERO CUAJADA - $18 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â yelp.com/biz_photos/casaâ€¦ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - [5/5 - This dish completely caught me off guard.

This is a serious contender for best foie gras dish I have ever tasted. I would've never expected it to taste this good. The sauce that they use was incredibly well-flavored... so much so, that you really need to eat the onion and other ingredients to balance out the richness of the dish.] * BONE MARROW W/CHERMOULA AND RADISHES - $15 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â yelp.com/biz_photos/casaâ€¦ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - [4/5 - The incredible chefs were so quick to serve their dishes that our bone marrow was done & plated at the same time as three other dishes. They ended up having to keep it on the counter for a while, then reheating the marrow. When we came in, one of the first dishes we saw them plate was the bone marrow, and I recall my husband and I commenting on how much marrow were in the 3 giant bones on the plate.. worried that we would be overwhelmed by the portions. When ours was finally served, it had little marrow, and only two cuts of bone. The flavor was still good, but my husband was rather disappointed.] * TAMARINDO PORK BELLY AND OCTOPUS W/BUTTERNUT SQUASH - $18 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â yelp.com/biz_photos/casaâ€¦ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - [5/5 - The butternut squash was a bit smoky, which took me by surprise. The pork belly was well-seasoned and incredibly delicious.. and the octopus was surprisingly tender, and very salty. Of course, this is not meant to be had on it's own - once you combine all the elements, the dish just comes together like magic.] ___________________________________ :::: TO ORDER NEXT TIME (5 repeats, 3 new) :::: - Paella Croquetas with Uni and Baby Tomatoes - $16 - Rabbit with Anticuchos and Habanero Cuajada - $18 - Sweetbreads with Fennel al Mono - $19 - Foie Gras with Cinco Cebollas - $19 - Tamarindo Pork Belly and Octopus with Butternut Squash - $18 - *NEW* Skirt Steak with Romesco and Onion Mermelada - $17 - *NEW* Duck Egg with Mojama and Black Truffles - $18 - *NEW* Beef Tongue with Tomato Caramel and Mushrooms Escabeche - $14",1
"Nyonya hit the spot! I had gotten an hour massage earlier in the afternoon, so I was dehydrated- and already getting sore- come dinner. That said, I started my meal with fresh coconut juice, served in a shaved coconut, and it was exactly what I needed! My friend and I then continued with shares of the steamed spring rolls, the lemongrass seafood stew with rice noodles, and the sauteed shrimp with vegetables, and everything was delicious. The spring rolls and the stew were particularly tasty, and together were filling enough that we could have done without the shrimp but we ate it all, regardless!",1
"I havent been there for the food but it smells delicious. This review is for the drinks, get the Lychee martini, best I've had anywhere in the city.",1
"Off to the side amongst the flagship retail stores of Soho sits a big boy bistro. Â The frittatas sitting on the skillet on the stove in back looked luscious. Â  We stuck to bacon wrapped dates, cheese and wine. $100 for two wasn't cheap but the value was good, especially for the ambiance. Star break down Distant and unfriendly waiters that gave slow inefficient service - 2 stars Food and wine is good but your paying a little more since your in SOHO - 3 Ambiance - 4",1
"A fellow Philadelphian and I discussed this bar and we agreed-the reason we love it is because it reminds us of the many beer bars in Philly that share the vibe of the Malt House. If I lived full time in the Village, this would be ""my bar."" Even as just a frequent visitor, I still consider this place to be that. They have a relaxed atmosphere with a bunch of TVs that are on for sports but otherwise blend in, a bunch of rustic picnic table type seating arrangements, and probably the best draft list in a few block radius-which, in the Village, is definitely saying something. The food is not exceptional as far as food goes but above and beyond regular bar food and has never disappointed me. Also a great brunch option with an ""all you can drink"" option, which includes their ""real"" brunch drinks, as opposed to a watered down version of a bloody mary (sadly a reality elsewhere in this neighborhood). One of the best traits I have found here is that the servers and bartenders are all really good. You can tell they really go out of their way to check on you, refill drinks, and just do a quality job. Overall-great beer, decent food, great sports spot-my favorite neighborhood bar for all three of the above combined.",1

"I am a fan indeed. Yes seafood in New York City can be expensive, but FISH has some good deals if you dine-in at the right times. For example $25 for all-you-can eat Blue Crabs before 4PM is ridiculous! (in a good way) Coming from a Seafood loving family, I was ecstatic about the deal. I could inhale a dozen blue crabs in 20 minutes. The seasoning wasn't the best I've had but good enough to keep me happy. My buddies and I had a feast with blue crabs, Market-price lobsters, clam chowders, fried calamari, and you can bet we ordered oysters too. Â Probably spent about $60 a person but we all left pretty satisfied. Unfortunately, that was the only experience I had at FISH, but I will be back for sure. Maybe even tonight...?",1
"I have been twice for brunch and dinner and it was OK both times. I really wanted to love this place because I feel NY is seriously lacking in the Southern food category. Every time I go the the South, I am reminded how great the food in the south is, South Carolina FTW! Southern food is all about low and slow, too bad New York is all about high and fast lol So I guess it's kinda damned out of the gate lol The food: Louisiana Jambalaya- with cast iron cornbread and fried egg. I thought this dish was good, but for the first few bites, it gets too repetitive. I think it's a good dish to share, the cornbread was nice, the fried egg didn't offer much. yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦ Eggs Bohemia w/ Kale, chicken apple sausage, cheddar and red pepper. This was a special for the day and it was pretty meh, it was scrambled eggs with stuff in it.

"So I was pretty much expecting juniors to be the usual expensive fattening and not very good times square tourist trap restaurant (I see you, bubba gumps.) But it was pretty legit (minus that fattening part.) It was busy and there was a wait middle of the afternoon on a Saturday. We snagged 2 seats at the bar. Our waiter/bartender was very friendly and on point. Â They give you complimentary pickles, beets, and something else I can't remember while you wait. The menu is HUGE. Â They have something for just about anyone but it's mainly diner/diner stuff with a few variations (ribs, etc). I went with the scoop salad which had chicken salad, potato salad, and coleslaw salad...like you expect in a diner. It seems like the deli sandwiches (corned beef, pastrami, etc) are their speciality. Their foo-foo drinks looked yummy but I had to save sugar points for dessert. We tried the red velvet and the carrot cake cheesecake. The actual cheesecake was delicious!!! The actual cake parts left a little to be desired. The red velvet was a bit dry and the carrot had a sort of odd overly floral taste (maybe ginger?) Anywho, its still times square so its no real bargain, and I'm told the original in Brooklyn is better. Either way, I still thought it was really good, friendly service and decent price for the area.",1
"Tuk Tuk serves the best food on any given night in LIC. The casual atmosphere, the friendly wait staff. This place never disappoints. However, the Penang curry (my favorite) isn't as consistent as I'd like them to be. Sometimes it's really spicy. Sometimes it has too many peanuts. But it's still my go to spot for delectably edible food.",1
If your come here order a number 1 or 2 thats what they are famous for. Dumplings have soup inside and are always cooked fresh comes with vegetables which I don't eat. If you plan on dining in make sure you havr reservation because the wait can be a while.,1
"I am a thai food aficionado. Been to thailand over 20+ times and this place is as close as you can get to local thai cuisine in Bangkok. For lunch, I always Â go for the Wok Basil With Chicken ($9 tax not included). I love how the layout/atmosphere is suppose to depict a local street in Bangkok (though so much cleaner ;)). For lunch this is definitely worth it.",1
What a gem of a restaurant! Â I'm very thankful to now live just a block or so away from Giovanni's. Â I'm sure I'll return again and again.,1
"Went last night for an early Valentine's Day dinner. I started with the Spicy Duck Meatballs, which were tender and seasoned with mint (or probably perilla) as well as others. My wife had the Calamari Salad, which was very good, but was heavily fried and filling. Personally, I am not a huge fan of calamari at finer restaurants, because I I never notice a huge difference in flavor from place to place...it's always just fried squid. For dinner we split the special bone in steak for two, which came cut in strips. This wasn't necessary because you could separate it with a butter knife it was so tender. It came with sides of Â fries and and a cabbage salad, which both complimented the steak. For drinks I had a cocktail with gin, perilla (like herby mint), grapefruit, and prosecco, which was quite good and not too sweet. The beer list had several distinctive selections but was not extensive. The service was generally excellent. Our waitress was attentive throughout our meal, and drinks were refilled often.",1
"I thought the food was really good, and the restaurant was very busy. Â It had a light and open feeling to the restaurant. I ordered the sheep's milk dumplings, and they were really really enjoyable. The service wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either. I'd definitely consider going back.",1
"Great neighborhood restaurant. I've been here over 10 times over the years and have never had anything bad. It's easy to make a reservation and I rarely had to wait to be seated. Bruchette with ricotta/black truffle honey, antipasta platters, gnocchi, and pappardelle are excellent. Their pastas are little below $20 and the fish/meat dishes are about $22.",1
"I don't go always go hogging but when I do it's heritage pork. Did you know pigs have a pouch where they carry the sins of mankind? I did not know this until I popped the first morsel of jowl in to my mouth which instantly melted in to what can only be described as liquid decadence. I think there might have been meat in it but I don't know or care because it would probably just get in the way. You can spread this stuff on toast because of how creamy, rich and soft it is. The brisket was good with a flavor I have never tasted before but be warned that it depends where in the cut your piece comes from that determines how tender it is. One slice was incredibly soft and another was much chewier and a little tougher. It's not gonna change your life but it should be on your brisket-to-try-before-I-die list. In must-have order on your first visit: 1. Brisket (beans as a side too) 2. Pork Jowl 3. Ribs 4. Sausage 5. Sirloin You'll probably order three out of that list tops unless you're some kind of sick bastard who can eat more than a pound and a half of fatty pork in one sitting. If you're with a big group you can all order a big heap of everything and figure out some kind of sharing arrangement to sample more things. Bring a pillow for the subway or have a car waiting for you when you get out cause the 'itis gonna get yo ass when you leave this joint son! After 1 1/4 pounds of glistening pork I was nodding off in to a smoke-flavored coma even a shot of adrenaline couldn't wake me from.",1
"West Village hotspot, industry darling (""World's Best Cocktail Bar"" per TOTC '11), purveyor of fine syrups for in-home use (try the grenadine!), legendary staff training regimen...how could EO possibly rise to meet the wave of hype and deliver a customer experience to match? The answer begins and ends with the staff. Usually if you see a bartender free pouring cocktails, that's your cue to get the hell out of there on the first opportunity. Here, feel free to stick around. The training level is that high. These guys could pour an ounce and a half of Fernet in their sleep. Not to mention everyone here is fun and will make a fabulous drink for any palate. And they serve chicken soup at 4am on the house. The sole reason EO isn't a no-brainer, automatic 5-star is the crowd density. I'm happy that it's possible to get in but it's just so packed. I don't begrudge them, as it's justifiably popular, but I wish they would open an equally cool bar next door called Vodka Soda with said drink comprising the entire menu. Could open things up a bit. World's Best? Perhaps not but it's not far off either.",1
"I've been going here for over 11 years, and it's still fantastic. Â The portobello mushroom/chicken dumplings are just delicious--smelling and tasting. The lychee martinis are also delicious as usual. Â Very very packed on the weekends, which slows down service considerably, and seems to stress out the servers. Â The bar is the best place to get your drinks if you're stopping in.",1
"This place is really delicious, but beware a lot of their dishes are made with pigs feet. The collage hotpot is incredibly tasty and their homemade gyoza is amazing! Â Lots of flavor! Their sushi was just okay. However, you should order dessert to complete your meal. I guarantee you will be leaving happy and full.",1

"A grand luxurious cafe -- absolutely beautiful light fixtures and furniture, there's even a grand piano (which they use when they have concerts/cabaret). The atmosphere is incredibly authentic. The waitstaff is also authentic, they leave you alone -- which some people find dismissive or inattentive but I find completely refreshing... The dessert selection is phenomenal, and they're all spectacular -- I'm not usually a dessert person but for this place I make an exception... Most things are very reasonably priced, except for the coffee and hot chocolate ($11!) but the service is extremely elaborate and posh. Great sandwiches and soups, great selection of juices. I really like the food here, but the ambiance is what's really the selling point for me. A great excuse to spend a whole day in a beautiful setting (the wonderful Neue Galerie). I love this place.",1
"Came here with the lady for our anniversary dinner. Getting in: - Need to make a reservation - the reservation line opens up 6 weeks in advance Atmosphere: - Bar on lower floor to hang out prior to being seated - dimly lit and a romantic vibe. Â Fantastic Aperol Spritz. - Main dinning area is nicely lit and you sit around a U shaped table with the kitchen in the middle/back - There is a single larger table as well which is not connected to the U - Bathrooms are nice with lots of plant life - Music choice was strange and quite loud for the space - Odd but worth pointing out: no women were working at all that night. Â Just pointing that out Service: - Service was very mixed for us - At the bar the service was good, no complaints - While seated for dinner I would describe the service as awkward - The staff would make little dance moves to the music... - Several times, dishes were presented and there was a strange silence as the server just stared at us prior to giving the description - On several occasions when we were served a plate, the plate was not described at all leaving us to wonder what we were eating: e.g., we were served a ""lobster roll"" which was clearly an interpretation of one. Â It would have been awesome to have been told that the bun was actually a meringue. Â That's half the excitement of eating at places like this - the creativity! Â  - On several occasions when we were served a plate, the wrong or conflicting descriptions with the patrons next to us were given to us: e.g., we were told on the oyster dish that the oyster was from Maine vs. the couple next to us were told Massachusetts - One server was spectacular and that was the gentleman who prepared our tea at the end. Â There was quite a ceremony involved and he was all around a very professional and polite server Drinks: - We ordered two half bottles and some Madeira which were great and were paired nicely by the sommelier Â  Courses/Food: - There were 20 courses - There were 7-10 courses that were just spectacular (trout filet, trout pate, trout roe, line caught fluke, lamb tartar, lobster roll, duck) - At least 8 courses left a lot to be desired and really made me wonder about this place, this was especially true of the sea urchin Other: - Overall this place really let me down - It almost tries to be Chef's Table with a different flare - The food and experience were not commensurate with the price tag",1
"Two words: chicken sashimi. Oh dear. I hate being the one-star-witch in a sea of four-star-belles, but my experience here was something out of a David Lynch movie. If David Lynch were to write a scene in a Mexican Manhattan cafe, that is. Went with four friends. Saturday lunch. Picked this place based on the positive reviews here, and also on the fact that I had always walked by and wondered what it was like. We get there, sit down, and immediately notice that the menu for brunch/lunch is very small- to a fault. A lot of the dishes sound like variations of each other, signifying a shortage of ingredients and/or creativity. My friend was DYING for some guacamole. We joke around that he needs an IV pumping guac into his veins (horrific image but I did say it was a Lynch movie). So he asks the waiter for guac and the waiter goes ""we don't do it"". However... they have avocados in almost all the dishes, as well as tomatoes and onions and cilantro. Are you telling me that a Mexican cafe really does not know how to smash a few things together (which they had lying around, clearly) to make the quintessential mexican dipping sauce?!? What the heck??? We then proceeded to order some food, and it was like Russian roulette. Almost every request was greeted with an empty gaze by the waiter, followed by ""we don't have that anymore"". So you have a menu with 10 things on it, and 8 have gone missing. Not a good prospect. The worst part of the experience... the part that actually made this whole ordeal memorable, in a weird sadistic way... was the chicken sashimi. After a few minutes of us getting there, a stocky, friendly Mexican man plodded along to the bar counter of the cafe. He was carrying a huge metal tray, and covering the tray, like a blanket, was a sheet of aluminum foil. The Mexican man proceeded to remove the foil and reveal... dozens, nay, hundreds of RAW... RAW... RAW chicken breasts. He proudly proceeded to tenderize them with a custom-made tool, and within seconds the cafe was filled with the puke-inducing stench of RAW... RAW chicken. I kid you kids not when I say that I was close to throwing up. And this was before we ate anything. The mere sight of the stocky Mexican manhandling RAW chicken in a cafe with maybe 10 tables was traumatizing to the core. Not to mention that it was unhygienic, obviously. But shit, I've eaten lamb brains in Morocco and bull balls in Malawi, so the unhygienic thing I can get over. It was the putrid smell of RAW chicken filling my nostrils at noon on a Saturday that etched itself into my frail mind. I promptly grabbed my friends and ran for the hills. ""Years of therapy later, he became a functioning human being once again- but the recurring dreams of Mexican men battering chicken to a creamy pulp remained, like a vietnam flashback that overstayed its welcome. And the pain persisted. The RAW pain."" p.s. we didn't actually eat anything.",1
"I don't really know much about what a true macaron should taste like, but I know that macarons are truly finicky to make and it's difficult to capture so much flavor in such a small cookie. Â Laduree makes such a feat look easy. Â We got a box of 8 which is arranged in a beautiful box. Â It is not cheap, but your mouth will taste every morsel of that macaron in that mouth. Â Each flavor we had has truly exploded in our mouth. Â The rose macaron felt like a rose rooted and planted itself in my mouth. Â The summer fruit and the chocolate venzuelan macaron were just luscious. Â Each macaron is truly a delight to the taste buds. Â The store is beautiful and fanciful. Â I am looking forward to eating more macarons. Â If you want to truly treat yourself, go ahead, get a few macarons at Laduree.",1
Small but lovely,1
"6 oysters + wine or beer for $8.00. You simply can't beat it. This place has a great atmosphere, the oysters were delicious, they had a great wine selection, the staff is friendly - what can go wrong? The only issue is that it was cold outside and it was busy with a wait so the door was kept open quite a bit blowing freezing wind inside. I would highly recommend for a pre-dinner drink and appetizer.",1
Halal Guys definitely has good halal but I dont believe it is the best anymore. Sometimes the rice is pretty dry. But good thing it is still 6 bucks.,1
"Been here so many times and every time it is amazing. Â Aside from having the second best burger in manhattan (other than the off-menu burger at lure that I by accident tried once), this place has incredible bloody mary's (both the green bloody mary and the oxtail broth ""surf and turf"" bloody mary are incredible - the oxtail broth because it has a smoother but deeper taste and the green just because it is different and a bit lighter than most bloody marys), perfect manhattans and then what I tried today for brunch - the slow cooked ham with hay (its cooked in a crock pot with hay to give it a more tender but also smoother taste), grits, eggs, biscuits and gravy. Â (note, they don't serve alcohol pre-noon) Just great. Â Decor is also awesome too - old tavern done right.",1
"Maybe 2 1/2 stars? You have to look at this place for 2 reasons: 1) the food 2) the experience FOOD: the pizza here is really good. Great... No... Really good. Keep it simple and don't over do the toppings; it spoils the pie. I usually get pepperoni or just a regular pie. FYI - they don't do slices. You can do a 1/2 1/2 pizza for toppings. My visiting friends always want to load up their pizza like Pappa Johns and usually end up eating all my Pepperoni because they like it more... I hate that LoL. EXPERIENCE: the new building is cute; much better than the old small place. But, in my view, the history of it all is lost because they relocated. They also removed alcohol from their menu the last time I went... If you're a drinker. I ONLY go here with visiting tourist. I would never come here on my own. It's not worth it to wait 1 hour in line for pizza that's just GOOD. The reason you go here is because you've walked the Brooklyn Bridge and this is another known tourist spot. There is better (lesser known) pizza in NYC [see other reviews*]. There is also a Grimaldi's in Manhattan that is a branch of this one that is essentially the same in the old LimeLight Church = more NYC history. I think that's a better option since you get pizza AND history... If you really have to say you had Grimaldi's Pizza. *i went on a Pizza Tour of New York one summer as a self experiment. I got fat; but are a lot of good pizza pies. LoL",1
"First, the ambiance here is great. Rustic feel with wooden tables, dim lighting and high tops. There is a separate room in the back with a few tables, where my friend and I were seated. They have a great selection of spanish wines and our waitress was very knowledgeable in them. We ordered the ham croquettes and croquette of the day (mushroom), which were both delicious. Very creamy, rich and flavorful! We also got the chorizo (get the small portion for just two people - they give you a big portion), artichoke wrapped in serrano ham (great as well), spanish cheese plate (less impressive), and the patatas bravas, which were by far our favorite. They give you a big portion and the aioli that is served on top of the potatoes is perfect! I would definitely go again. Make sure to make a reservation!",1
"This place reminds me of being in asia at a hawker stall.. its great handmade noodles, super cheap, fast service..the spicy sauce is SPICY, I came here after bikram yoga and completely wiped out the entire beef noodle soup bowl..muahahaaa..",1
"The best steak I have had in NYC. I went with my close friends for a quiet birthday celebration and was blown away by the experience. So, the key is to make reservations before hand and it wasn't a struggle to get a table of four for 8pm on a Wednesday. But there were a lot of people waiting when we arrived. We were seated and we all ordered the same thing. Hey, when is a better time to realize that your friends really reflect you. You know that saying ""Tell me who you love and I will tell you who you are"" Well, I love my friends and we all apparently love steak and fries. I knew my friends were going to take care of my meal but I wanted to at least take care of at least one bottle of wine. I was able to quietly tell my server the situation and she did a spectacular and professional job making sure my friends got wine and I was able to quietly pay for a bottle. The service was great and attentive. It seemed that they know that the place has a great reputation and want to keep it that way. And the food was divine. We asked to put all the sauces on the side and for some reason dipping and trying other peoples stuff (even though we all got the same thing) make everything taste amazing. And as I said before. The. Best. Steak. As the night progressed we wondered if we could bring out a large cupcake that we had. A little unsure, we asked and the server brought us a lighter to light a candle and didn't even charge a cake fee. Don't know if this is the norm but it really made my night. Overall, a really really good birthday dinner with good friends and good food.",1
One of my favorite retaurants in the city! Â definitly on my radar for a revisit!,1
"I recently went back and was delighted to see that they had expanded. Love the friendly service and space. Â Food was so good. Â Get the meatballs and schnitzel. I really liked the Eliminator (gin, elderflower, lemon, doppel bock) cocktail!! I havent drank in awhile so I was very happy to be welcomd back into the drinking world with such a delish cocktail.",1
"It goes without saying that the Bottomless Brunch has essentially become synonymous with New York City, and no where else is more renowned for it than Calle Ocho. This Upper West Side restaurant is housed in the Excelsior Hotel, and despite having multiple dining areas, is easily booked out over a month in advance for weekend brunch. I attempted to plan a brunch with three other friends and literally had to make it for a day over a month and a half in advance; the lesson here is to come prepared. On the day of, we all arrived promptly and were shown to our table. While Calle Ocho used to let guests serve themselves Sangria, this procedure has now been swapped with having the server take drink orders one at a time. I opted for the Punta Cana, a white sangria with mamajuana and diced peaches, oranges, and pineapples. I have to say that I was pretty disappointed by it; the quality of alcohol was clearly lacking and there were very few pieces of fruit to be found in the glass. Thankfully, we were able to dig in their generous bread basket while we waited for our entrees to arrive. It took a considerable amount of time before we received our plates, but I'd opted for the Vaca Frita, which was presented (for some reason) on a rectangular plate. The main protein, the Cuban Skirt Steak, was slightly overcooked beyond the medium I'd requested, but was seasoned well and had a good chew to it. On the other side of the plate, the Pork Fried Rice was served with two fried eggs and a few slices of avocado. The rice was very tasty, with crisp cubes of pork interspersed in the yellow rice, and even better with the fried eggs, which still had a soft yolk, and the avocado. Dessert was also satisfactory, as the flan and the sorbet trio we ordered were much-needed counters to the savory mains we had earlier. Note that the Passionfruit sorbet was far too acidic, even for my tastes... And I usually enjoy the additional punch of citrus or vinegar in my food. It's hard for me, someone who can't really handle alcohol, to give what I think is a fair assessment of Calle Ocho, but I found the drinks underwhelming and the food to be slightly above average, although most certainly overpriced. Service is also on the slower end during weekends as well, given the number of customers and orders that they have to handle, but if you're looking for a boozy brunch and have plenty of time in the afternoon, Calle Ocho might be just the spot for you.",1
"We came late on a Friday solely for the cheesecake. We walked in the main restaurant which was packed to the brim. After waiting on a table for nearly 10 minutes, we realized we could just hop to the bakery next door. I got a slice of the original cheesecake and the bf got the chocolate and yellow cake. Luckily there was no line, so we were in and out within 5 minutes. There was patio seating in front, but we took it back to our hotel. The yellow cake was alright, but the cheesecake was definitely the best I've had. If you can look past the touristy crowd, grabbing a cheesecake from the bakery will not disappoint.",1
"I think people who think these guys have a great list have either never been to Philadelphia, Baltimore or Brooklyn...or a few blocks away to The Ginger Man. Nevertheless, an excellent leap forward from the usual, especially the Hardy's bottles they decided to stock!",1
"I was on the quest to find a delicious, melt in your mouth type of restaurant for mine and my boyfriends anniversary. I did my research, and realized that I wanted to try La Sirene, a BYOB French joint I have had my eye on for quite some time now. When I arrived, I was surprsied to find that the restaurant wasn't as cute or quaint as described in previous reviews. I know it has recently been redone, so that could be the reason. Since we had brought our own wine (no corkage fee, which is tough to find in NYC these days) we knew we wanted to get a little crazy with the food. When my boyfriend and I go out to eat, we share everything so we can taste more. We definitely left feeling full and happy. Here is what we got: French Onion Soup: Â We started with the french onion soup, even though it was a 100 degree day in NYC, because I had read online that it was the best french onion soup that people have ever had. Since I love french onion soup we ordered it. However, it really just tasted like your run of the mill, normal french onion soup. It was good don't get me wrong, but it definitely wasn't anything special. Probably unnecessary because it filled us up early on in the meal. Tartelette De Chevre Frais Aux Echalotes, Truffles, Raisins Confit Et Voile De Vieux Gruyere goat cheese tart with shallots, truffles, grape and a veil of 180 days aged swiss cheese: This tart was absolutely amazing. I am a sucker for truffle and goat cheese, and who doesn't love a good pastry? I highly reccomend this dish to anyone that goes to La Sirene. It was melt in your mouth delicious, a favorite part of my meal. Tournedos Rossini: Based on Yelp reviews, I knew that the tournedos rossini at La Sirene was a must try. This was my first time tasting fois gras, so I was Â a little nervous but it turned out to be amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection and I LOVED the fois gras! I definitely get the hype! Kassulet Toulousain De La Maison cassoulet toulouse's style (cannellini beans, tomato, garlic duck confit, slab bacon & pork sausage all braised with duck fat): My boyfriend and I were both actually pretty disappointed with this dish. Our waitress had warned it would be heavy, but I thought she meant becuase of its fatty succulent goodness. It turned out to be a stew, with not much flavor. I was expecting this to be exploding with flavor, but there was definitely something lacking. I definitely wish we would have gone with something else. Maybe the lamb. I do reccomend La Sirene, although all the dishes weren't my favorite. I definitely recognize quality food when I taste it. I would just avoid the Kassulet, because although the description sounds insanely amazing, it just isn't.",1
"I'm a big fan of the set-up of this place. It's a school room of deliciousness. It's especially nice in the summer, as there's outdoor seating and giant windows that let in the light. My friends and I ordered a big plate of charcuteries to share. It was great - the meat was thinly sliced and deliciously fatty, and they served it with pickles and bread slices. Arguably the best part of the meal. We also got the duck leg confit, which was nicely cooked but overall a big letdown. The green sauce they used made the duck came off as overly sweet instead of savory. Would come again though, if only to give the foie gras oatmeal a try!",1
"This place is so overrated and overpriced. Â If you've been to CA, it is a Lemonade wannabe, and it ain't gonna be. The food seemed room temperature to me, it all sounds appetizing and there are many options, but nothing I tried was worth how much it costs. When you first walk in there is a juice bar, my boyfriend got an avocado smoothie, and he didn't even finish it and threw it out before he even ordered an entree. When you continue walking, there is a while wall of packaged dry items, and even some wet, from fancy and/or local vendors. Â It cost like $10 for hummus or something ridiculous like that. Then there is the hot food, displayed cafeteria style. Â I got the potatoes and bacon with pot roast and my boyfriend the chicken. Not that great and I LOVE potatoes, its like the hardest food to mess up, but easy to mess up if theyre cold and hard. Don't waste your time here.",1
best. pizza. ever. enough said.,1
"I think my arteries just exploded. Came at 11-ish to beat the lunch rush. They give you a *gigantic* plate of food; I got beans+rice, plantains, and roast chicken. Chicken was tender and greasy, plantains were greasy and sweet - sensing a pattern here? Definitely what people call a dive, but the workers were kind enough to put enough with my clueless, non-Spanish speaking self when ordering. Other reviewers were correct; the clientele here is pretty diverse. I saw: 2 policemen, 1 older Asian gentlemen, a Hispanic girl and her father, an African American 20-something.",1
"Came here with a regular who knows the right stuff to order and wasn't being stingy about getting different plates. I was fortunate to try a good number of their small plates: omelette, shrimp shumai, Goma tofu, and a few others that I can't remember. I enjoyed the appetizers, especially the omelette. Soft and delicious. Can't say that I enjoyed the soba but I don't think it's fair to say that it was because of the restaurant. I am not a huge soba fan. I prefer ramen all the way. To me, soba is just bland unless you pour the sauce on the side that it comes with. I did like my duck slices, though. They were yummy. I would much prefer to pair my duck with a bowl of ramen noodles. In any case, service was good. It would have been helpful if the restaurant had two restrooms because it got crowded and it was not pleasant having to wait in line near the entrance because that is where the restroom is located. Not a big deal, but it was something that caught my attention. I am not swearing off soba altogether. I'd like to give it another chance but perhaps at another spot.",1
"Never actually eaten in (although it looks SUPER cute now), but done massive catering orders from them for my last TWO birthday parties and its been fantastic both times. Â Fried chicken is very hard to keep good over a long period of time but this stays crunchy even after sitting out for several hours. Â Great Mac 'N Cheese too. Â Definitely if you order catering from them make sure to do 2 of the mac 'n cheese since we always forget and then run out!",1
"Great location for a first meeting. Mimosas are fresh and the coffee strong and flavorful. Ok pricing and the Crepes were quite large. Simple but good food. Quaint decor, no frills or pretentiousness.",1
"A lovely restaurant. Â I'd describe it as old New American. They take classics like meatloaf, fried chicken, grilled sausages, creamed spinach, fish, and present it in a way similar to what you'd see at Chestnut on Smith Street or Applewood in Park Slope. The sweet potato/goat cheese croquettes are yummy, as are the home made pickles. Â Amazing trout wrapped in bacon, and the broiled chicken looks and smells fabulous (from the table next to us) An impressive wine list with a lot of prize winners from Finger Lake and L.I. wineries. Â I'm impressed that they have Herman Weimer Riesling (though not by the glass), though they do have Dr. Frank by the glass, which is good, but not as good as Weimer. A great dessert selection. Â The room is pleasant. Mangement: Â If you're reading this, I'll up you a star for Weimer by the glass and if you put a curtain by the door during the winter. I was the second table in and every time someone came or left, we got an arctic blast. I'll be back soon.",1
"I rarely go into Williamsburg, but if I do, it's usually because I'm going to Fette Sau. I'm gonna be honest, I usually over order. That's because everything looks so damn good. (And probably because I never go unless I make sure I'm really really hungry.) Every time I go, I have to have the baby back ribs, I have to try the brisket, I have to have a berkshire sausage, I have to have the half-sour pickles, I have to have the potato salad, and the Mexican Coke, and the soft rolls. You can see how this could be a problem. I don't usually venture to the bar, but I do know they have a huge variety of beers on tap. One fun thing to mention is that the beers come in half-pints, so if you're a wimpy lightweight like me, you can get an appropriately-sized drink. What's usually a hit or miss about Fette Sau are the crowds. I've been there when the lines have snaked all the way outside and to the front gate. I've also been there when there's been a reasonably short line. But whether or not it's crowded, it's always worth the wait.",1
"I'm a bit surprised by all of the comments about long waits. Came here at 7:15 PM on a Saturday and was seated within 5 minutes. My two friends and I perused this tempting menu from head to toe and we settled on the ""mac attack"" sampler to split and then I went for the meatloaf. The mac attack is a plain mac and cheese, one with truffle oil, and one with bacon. Each is sinfully good and different enough to warrant trying. The basic one is...well, basic. But still light, delicious and crusty on top. The truffle oil makes you feel alive and the flavor comes out really well. The bacon one is perhaps the best cause bacon makes everything awesome. The meatloaf wasn't my first choice, but the server recommended it over the fried chicken salad or the fried chicken. When I bit into the meatloaf, the green beans or the garlic mashed potatoes, Cafeteria's reputation of solid comfort food was clear. I could have been in mom's kitchen or on vacation...damn. Add on the passion fruit caipirinha. That was sweeeet. And top it off with the fact that this whole meal was like $38 (all in with tax and tip...even less if you don't get the cocktail). This place is solid - and if it helps, lots of pretty people dine here too.",1
"Intimate candle-lit little wine bar in Hells Kitchen. Â The wine is great. Â Crusty bread with olive oil. Â Menu consists of small plates, pastas, salads and charcuterie. Â  They literally pack you in elbow to elbow at the bar, but that's charming... Right? Ordered and enjoyed the burrata prosciutto special. Â The mussels. Â And pasta with prosciutto in cream sauce. Â Was plenty of food for the two of us. Recommended!",1
"I came here for lunch on a weekday with a friend. We came right when it opened and this place definitely doesn't get very crowded for lunch. I really liked the ambience and the way the restaurant was decorated despite how empty it was at the time. As for food, I got the saba teishoku. The mackerel tasted decent and it came with the grated radish on the side. Both of our lunch specials also came with pickled vegetables, salad, and miso soup. The food was good, but I'm not sure I'd want to come back here for lunch.",1
"Yes, you should go here, to answer your question. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and it hits that spot in your taste buds and tummy that you didn't know you had but now what to hit again and again. Their brunch menu is a breakfast panini paradise, and their regular menu also features a bunch of cheeses and meats option. Don't be overwhelmed by all the names of the cheeses and meats...they have a terminology guide so that you don't have to feel and look like a turd!",1
Big disappointment. Really average meal and way overpriced. I was there with my daughter and we left hungry. Â There are much better Italian restaurants at much lower prices. And far more enjoyable. WAY overhyped. Won't be back. The best part of the meal was my Sangranto de Montefalco Rosso. A reasonably priced bottle at about $50. Downhill from here!,1
pro: there's something very authentic about this place and the food is honest. they serve hot tea while you wait for a table! had a really interesting experience with the sea urchin (which i love) in fish broth jelly (which i found questionable). they have a pretty solid tempura soba. I like that they put the tempura on a separate plate so its not soggy when it gets to your table. TRY the WASABI ICE CREAM. con: Â a little pricey for the portions.,1
"This place has gone down hill. Â The host is as dumb as ever, constantly seating people in the wrong order (I asked him if he wanted to take down our name for the seating list, and he said there was no list, how hard is it to keep a list?). Â In addition, the food didnt seem to have the same taste and freshness that it had in the past. Â The cavatelli with shrimp and salmon had little flavor, for some reason the pesto sauce just had no freshness or punch. Â The veal and spinach ravioli had no spinach in it... I used to love this place, but its not worth going to anymore.",1
"So, i'd have to say. This place lives up to the reputation. I went here with my husband about 3 weeks ago for dinner, and it was quite a pleasant experience. We were greeted seat in no time. The setting was pictures of comfortable, intimate, Â yet pulsating with energy of what a city like NYC has to offer. We started with some drinks, I had a bramble and my husband had an old fashioned (which he swears is the best he's ever had... Delicious)!. Then for appetizers, we had the ravioli and the beet salad which were outstanding. I had the chicken for a main course and was cooked to perfection. My husband had the scallops which melted in his mouth. Our waitress was an instrumental part of the experience because she was sweet, attentive, yet not intrusive. All in all it was an excellent evening, one I will repeat.",1
busy place. simple broiled seafood. crowds love it.,1
"One of the most lovely old fashions I've had in a while. The ambience is nice, too. It was a fun place to be with my friends from Boston.",1
"After years of wanting to go to Little Owl and a month advanced in making our reservation, FFF and I headed there this past Sunday for Easter. With all the hype I've heard about this place I'm sad to say I never had an OMG moment like I did at Market Table. That being said, the next comment I'll address specifically to Mr. Adam Platt himself: There are a lot of things I don't understand... while I won't get into all of them on yelp, I do have some questions about your top 101 list. Why oh why is Little Owl on the list and Market Table is not? And why oh why is Kin Shop on the list and not Perilla? And The Breslin rated higher than Babbo? Really Mr. Platt??! Anyway, I digress.... back to Little Owl. FFF and I had to wait a couple of minutes and were seated up on the platform bench that overlooks the restaurant. From up there you can order wine, watch what's going on in the kitchen, and survey the small room of diners to see what on their plates looks most appealing. The space is warm and charming. The Chardonnay that we chose was lovely and full of buttery, oakiness just as we'd asked for. The wine list is also very decently priced. FFF and I started with the meatball sliders - yumm! However, a typical order has 3 and out came a small plate with 2 for each of us which I thought was a very nice gesture... that was until we were charged for an additional slider that we hadn't even asked for. Hmmm... For our entrees I had the lamb chops which were quite tasty but a bit on the pricey side for what they were. The potato Gruyere side and watercress salad that came with it was also very good and I ate every last bite. FFF had the pork chop. Now I know many yelpers have obsessed over this pork chop but we weren't so impressed. It was very salty (and I even like lots of seasoning and salt). We also split the mushrooms and toasted truffle breadcrumbs which were very tasty as well and full of flavor. Service was neither overly friendly or overly attentive. Our water glasses sat empty a majority of the night (a major pet peeve of mine). I enjoyed Joey Campanero's American cuisine but I did not walk out of Little Owl in love with him the way I always do at Market Table. FFF and I were glad we finally went but not dying to return anytime soon. A solid 3.5 but we'll round up to a 4.",1
"Honestly, a day doesn't go by when I miss my moules-frites and a solid glass of Chimay from Bruxelles. BXL Zoute has both along with impeccable service. I genuinely appreciated my meal here and will definitely be back.",1
"I had a great experience yesterday at Amy Ruth's. I previously gave 3 stars but was impressed by the food and service yesterday. Our waiter was attentive, the food was delicious, and it was just overall a pleasant experience. I tried the shrimp and waffles this time. It was really good. I also shared mac and cheese and the greens. They were also better than in the past when I've tried them. Yum!",1
"5 Delicious, fresh, and savory dumplings for $1?! YES PLEASE!! I can seriously eat these dumplings all day everyday! Even their sesame pancake sandwiches are cheap and delicious, although very oily. The only issue I have with this place is that it's TINY. Especially with the school across the street, kids come rushing in after school with their huge backpacks, smacking people in the back as they are eating! But for these dumplings, I would gladly put up with it. Just beware of the Monday to Friday, 3-4pm time frame!",1
"4.5* TIME/DATE: Wednesday night, February 27, 2013 (technically the 28th) / 1:00am AMBIANCE: Cute little dimly-lit place with an old school theme and an open kitchen.

The prices are great and very reasonable; you won't believe how cheap it is. You must try their Veggie Dumplings, The Spicy Shrimp Dumplings. You must also try their dumpling soups in the winter, sheer perfection. Vanessa's Dumpling House get two snaps and a circle.",1
The halo halo used to be good. Was so excited to go the second time but it tasted different. Not as much flan. Very small but i never had to wait. Depends what time and day u go.,1
"I did return and we stayed away from the appetizers and got two entrees instead. Much better experience this time around! Â Both the feijoada (black bean pork stew with collard greens and rice) and bucatini pasta with spicy sausage were good, home-cooking type of dishes. Â However, I'd order some other things to go along with your entree because they aren't that big.",1
"For $4 a slice and being opened at 4 am, this is the great late night snack place! Â The pizza crust is crunchy and breaks off the bite with the perfect sound. Â The margherita sauce and cheese are perfectly balanced, not too sour, not too creamy. And there was no thick oil layer on top.",1
"SriPraPhai is REALLY good. Â I'm not giving it a 5th star because I do think it's overhyped and the wait is not worth it. Â If you're going to order you should get like a fish or something you can't get at your local manhattan Thai joint because you will be disappointed. Get the fish. Â And if they say it's going to be spicy, you better bet it'll be burning coming out of your rear end the next day. Â WOOOH.",1
Everything is pretty good here as I've tried pretty much everything. Â Only downside is the wait for a table... Definitely recommended!!!,1
"Since there are enough reviews on the subject I will keep it short. This is quite possibly the best no nonsense Italian eatery in the city with enough to feed the mind, body, and soul. The menus are kept to what works well and regulars come for their favorites - like me! It's worth a subway ride and a walk to this West Village location. Btw, Cash only! (ATM next door)",1
"4 1/2..I'm probably the furthest thing possible from a vegetarian, but the veggie patties here are astonishing and quite likely my favorite cheap eat in my neighborhood. Â The veggie chicken is fantastic and the spicy chicken in a whole wheat patty is even better and presumably more guilt-free. Â This is the rare place an unabashed carnivore could take a vegan and leave happy and full. This Rasta-Irie spot hews to tradition and is about as chill as possible, with some of the coolest service in the city.",1
"Ok, let me tell you....my 14 year son has a trained pallet for sushi and only eats the sushi prepared by the disciples of JIRO. Â That said, this sushi was weak! Â  my son says ""horrible!"" ""Tiny portions"" ""sea urchin didn't taste fresh, and looked like vomit on a bed of rice"" Â ""the clams were chewy in the miso soup"". From my own experience, I felt the service was arrogant, the lights were overly bright, and the sushi chefs didn't seem interested. Â Buy a ticket to seattle with your money and dine at Shiros:)",1
OMG the ribs are outstanding. You really don't need any sauce - the meat is that good. It just gets crowded so I'd aim to go at an odd hour.,1
"Catfish is a solid go-to when you really don't know where to go/take your visiting guests/friends that don't know what exists outside of Williamsburg, BK. I've been there for brunch (banana fosters pancakes are a magical experience) and for dinner (le chalet with shrimp, ratatouille, shrimp and grits or even ordering a few sides when I'm not ravenous). Great selection of beers and other spirits for sure. My only suggestion is that the Voodoo bloody mary should be served with a sundae spoon to scoop the bits of crab/shrimp at the bottom of the glass. It's a great concept except that it can't go through your straw. Still tastes great but what got me were the shellfish chunks at the bottom! It was a selling point, but I got creative with my fork anyway... Also I wish there were more Catfish options on the menu. Maybe fried catfish and hush puppies? Still any ""criticism"" to this great Crown Heights staple doesn't stop me from coming back. Great service, friendly servers and bartenders.",1
"Everything is a burrito................. At least, that was the experience of my friend and me, who both ordered quesadillas served wrapped into little tubes rather than into folded pancakes. The actual food was also just A-OK. Solid but not astounding. I do think that Dos Toros Taqueria is more authentic than Chipotle though, if that's what you're going for. They also win points for a nice selection of hot sauces. I got the green one and my friend got the hottest, which was the darkest. It was muy picante (Spanish for seriously spicy).",1
"Prosperity dumpling house down the street has the better dumpling, although Vanessa's Dumpling house the cleaner/bigger restaurant. Â I ordered the classic pork and chive potstickers and felt they lacked flavor. Â Their famous peking duck sandwich was also a disappointment. Â Although the sesame pancake is made fresh, their peking duck is not.. and the meat was rather cold inside the sandwich. Â This place is packed with people, but it is really all just hype.",1
I can suggest one thing you can't go wrong with they make a awesome salad .I ordered the shrimp borough salad and it was great.,1
"Wow. I finally found a great taco place in NYC (I'm from California). The menu is simple and straightforward with a very limited number of choices. The tacos are made from fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor and umami. The pork/adobado taco was my favorite. The guys behind the counter are also super nice! My first time there I was scoping out the various food counters and one of them told me try a taco on the house. Great marketing. haha. I've been back multiple times since then! I love the fact that they have fresh limes there, too! Just a food counter in Chelsea market with a raised counter on the side for you to eat at. Or you can take your food to go and eat it on the Highline!",1
"This place rocks... Came here 20 minutes before they closed and it was still packed!! Fortunately it was a monday night and an hour or so before closing time is a perfect time to slide in without a wait. Â  Came in, got a grandma pie (margherita, it's what they are known for), a couple waters and the bill. Â  Best grandma I have ever eaten...for sure. Â Will stop in again soon, maybe on this trip again before I leave ;) Side note, They do not serve slices and it is CASH only, other than that, no negatives to this place",1
Expensive for what the quality of the food is. I am shocked that this place has received such high reviews. I tried a variety of menu options none of which stood out for me.,1
"I'm lactose intolerant and it was still worth it. Make the trip, wait the wait, and experience this institution.",1
"I wish I had a job so I could come to Yerba Buena more often. Or more than once. Well, honestly, the first time I came, I didn't even have to pay. So I ordered everything I could eat off the menu. I'm all about Pan-Latin American cuisine, because it usually ends up taking a bit of all the good stuff from each country and making you think Latin American is the tastiest, most heart warming food in the world. Our group of four had a wonderful meal here. We came on a Sunday night, and the place was full, but there were a couple empty tables. It's a tiny little restaurant: I say it could seat around 30 people. The host was friendly and on top of things, and our waiter was perfection. So definitely five stars for service. I can't speak for everything that was ordered by our table, as I'm a pescatarian, but everyone was extremely pleased by their meals. What we ordered: picada potato croquettes palmito fries (I have a massive fucking crush on palmitos) chupe de camaron black cod arroz con pollo short ribs churros with dipping sauce tres leches cake I wouldn't order the picada again, unless it's a party of two, because there aren't too many pieces of fried stuff in there. Plus, although good, it wasn't great, and I would recommend starting with potato croquettes or palmito fries over the picada. However, the salsa served with the picada was the shit. The potato croquettes are served with a jalapeno truffle sauce that was just phenomenal. The croquettes themselves were the best I've ever had. The palmito fries were likewise delicious, but I think a big reason for this was the tasty dipping sauce. Also, the sauce containers are small, so if you are with a group who totally overdips (as I was) make sure and request two. I had the chupe de camaron as my main, and it's certainly a big enough serving to qualify as an entree. I mean, it was a big-ass bowl of spicy, creamy shrimp soup. It has bits of yucca in it, and a nice bit of spice. It was perfection in soup form. I sampled some of the black cod, and it was cooked perfectly. I personally would never order arroz con pollo at a restaurant (hello, boring), but the person who ordered it loved it and devoured the whole thing. For dessert we had tres leches and churros. Well, everyone else ordered tres leches and I ordered churros, and then everybody wanted to eat my churros, but they were MINE. My precious. I am not the biggest tres leches fan (I know, I know), but the rest of the table was, and they said my churros were better than the tres leches. Mmm, churros. I saved the best for last: the cocktails. THE COCKTAILS! I am in love. I want to become a rich alcoholic and spend my nights sipping on these delicious concoctions. The table had the following drinks: Poquito Picante Pisco Punch Pisco Sour Sidecar Mojito (why you would order this at a place with such creative cocktails is beyond me) Boludo Yerba Mate Whiskey Smash Although all of them were carefully prepared, incredibly balanced, complex, and flat out delicious, the standouts were the Poquito Picante, the Boludo, and the Pisco Punch. I was incredibly impressed by my evening here, and I definitely plan on returning. Given the prices, it is probably best for a special occasion, although you could stick to a couple appetizers and drinks for a casual night out. P.S. They took Visa the night we were here; not sure what that's about, because their menu says Amex or cash only...",1
"Its a lovely little soba house tucked away on ninth street next to Robataya. A smallish space but very cozy especially on the cold night that I arrived with a friend. Its a place I would feel comfortable coming alone as well however as there is a bar-seating area towards the rear of the house from which a solo diner might relax while watching dishes being prepared. The service was pleasant as one might expect from such a friendly interior. And the menu seemed eclectic with many items Â beckoning me to return (see online for full menu at sobaya-nyc.com/wp/menus). Salmon Sashimi and Agedashi Tofu were presented in an attractive way and satisfying as appetizers. Our main courses were less so, however. My choice of the Tuna and Avocado Don was simply that: minced tuna and avocado over rice, a bit uninspiring. My friend's choice of the Kamo Nanban was better with its comforting slices of sauteed duck/green onions and soba in its warm broth but also less than outstanding. Dessert was easy to like with tofu panna cotta and ice cream though I would suggest (like others on yelp) sharing the wasabi ice cream as it may be overpowering for some. Looking forward to returning. And kudos to the house for offering dishes in ""mini"", ""regular"", and ""large"" sizes -we throw out enuf food as it is.",1
"I absolutely love Kinjo!! On a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon a friend of mine and I were looking to have a nice brunch after wandering around the Brooklyn Flea, only problem was that we also had my dog with me. After being turned down from multiple brunch spots, one went as far as to tell us to tie my dog to a bike rack. Does my dog look like a bike to you? I mean really, he's a tiny dog, weighs about 8lbs and all the spots we checked out did have outside areas to enjoy a nice brunch. Finally we stumbled upon Kinjo. We asked the waitress if we could sit outside with my dog, and she was totally cool with it!! We begin looking over the brunch menu and of course I want a mimosa, I begin to order one when our waitress suggests a sake mimosa. When you come here order it, it is probably one of the best mimosas I have ever had. Finally it's time to order food, I get the grilled chicken sandwich, it was so effing good, just the right amount of spicy. Overall I had a great experience at Kinjo and plan to be back as much as possible, I mean I live about 20 minutes walking from it, so it would be silly not to frequent it.",1
These little bites of deliciousness for whatever change left is left in your wallet sounds like a great idea to me anytime of the day. Everything I tried here has been delicious- must try the dessert Montadito with oreos & nutella! It's AMAZING!,1
"Cafe Steinhof is the restaurant that every neighborhood wants, whether they know it or not. Â Let me count the ways: - Good beers, both on tap and by the bottle - Decent wine list - Large, varied menu with a lot of options - Very affordable Bottom line is that there isn't much not to like about Cafe Steinhof. Â Try the meatloaf sandwich. Â Or the fried cod sandwich. Â Or the wiener-schnitzel sandwich (or the wiener-schnitzel platter). Â Or the goulash. Â Or the... hell, almost anything. Food is consistently good and filling, all at a reasonable price, all in a comfortable neighborhood setting. CS might not be a destination place, but if you live anywhere in the neighborhood, wander on over to CS and enjoy a platter or a sandwich, along with one of their potent potables. Â I'll bet you'll be back.",1
"First time here at Jane for brunch with one of my best friends and I am a fan now! service: definitely make a reservation beforehand when you come here, you won't regret it. The waiter took our orders and it came quick. Even though the restaurant was busy, they did not rush us to finish our meals like some brunch places I've been to in the past. Food: initially I wanted to try the vanilla bean French toast since I love French toast, but I end up getting the Benedict Jane. It was first time eating a crab and crawfish cake Benedict ever and it was so delicious! It tasted even better when I popped the egg and the yolk was running throughout my dish! The side potatoes were perfectly seasoned and chase it down with the best Bloody Mary I had so far. I loved the burn from it! It was my first time ordering a Bloody Mary since I was never a fan but I acquired it recently since my bf always order that drink when we Â  Â  brunch. My best friend had the grilled chicken sandwich with home fries and it was good too, but I liked mine better! She got a passion screwdriver and it really taste like a passion fruit blended into that drink. It was yum! Ambience: it was cozy and modern decor. A plus was that it was definitely a lot more space to eat compare to other brunch places. There's a downstairs area but being upstairs was better. There's a bar where you can sit down and wait for your table if it is available. Recommended?yes, definitely a place where you can bring your friends and significant others. It gives off a relaxed vibe. I will definitely come back!",1
"A lot of the reviews rave about this place, but I'm not sure why. My wife and I went here tonight and the first thing I noticed was that the menus smelled like urine (no joke) and there were fruit flies swarming around our table. Ok, whatever....chalk it up to the place being ""authentic,"" and I'll let that slide, a little. We ordered a few beers which were well priced, so that wasn't too bad. Other than that, the food was meh. We wanted a seaweed salad, but it was sold out, so we got a braised seaweed dish instead--it was ok, but pretty salty, but I didn't mind. We also got this skewer dish (set A) which had a selection of meats on it, but they all pretty much tasted the same EXCEPT what was (as far as BOTH my wife and I were able to surmise) SUPPOSED to be quail eggs, but was just, in fact, fried garlic cloves....uhhhh? We also got a few other lackluster dishes. Overall, it was on the cheaper side, and I suppose if I was WASTED it might not seem so bad, but I wasn't, so it did seem so bad. Probably won't be going back.",1
Another visit and another outstanding BBQ! Your mouth glands know there's a real smoker the minute you walk in! Brontosaurus rib would satisfy a caveman! Melts in your mouth with rich smoked flavor! Burned ends make you drool! The only suggestion is add a winter door to the entrance as the cold air cools the bbq! Best bbq in east coast period!,1
"Its like getting a homemade Cuban dish. The food is pretty nice and the prices are pretty spot on. I think the corn is overrated, its a simple appetizer you can make at home. The place is extremely small and gets really crowded during the evenings. I don't think this is really a good place for conversation since it gets really loud.",1
"Creativity ! so hard to find around the city .....find it here ! Beautiful place that give joy to eat at & excellent service ! Had the Brussels sprouts pizza , excellent ! shawing ! Great scallops dish with their mashed potatoes side was one of the best comfort food . The rest of the food is as i said about the creativity , flavors, colors, smells , all together combine great experience .",1
"10pm on a Friday night and both floors were not packed. Surprised but hey, more elbow room. Didn't try the beers but had two mixed drinks that weren't too strong. The music varied from top 40 to recent hits from the past 10 years.",1
"Cash only. Good burger. Juicy fella. Not the most appealing to look at, but delicious. Space is a bit cramped. There is an ATM in the bar though so that's good. And staff is pretty friendly. Got the cheeseburger, medium rare. It came out pretty quick with the place pretty packed.",1
My boyfriend and I were looking for a good brunch spot and have eaten here on many occasions but only because there aren't a lot of options. Every time we've been there the menu has been the same and very limited. I'm not a super picky eater but there is only one thing I like on the menu. The backyard is nice. Â Haven't been back in months because we got so tired of eating the same thing. Â I do hope they've expanded their brunch menu.,1
"How have I not written a review for JoJu?? I live a few blocks away and I used to always eat here when I was too lazy to make dinner. It's been a while though, but all I remember is the sandwiches are super tasty. You can customize any sandwich (for an additional price) with a runny or fried egg and I believe there are different sauces as well. The banh mi is filled with the usual pickled carrots, daikon, and cilantro. JoJu also recently added banh mi fries, which consists of everything you would find in a banh mi, but on top of fries and kimchi fries. Why no one else ever thought of this is beyond me. They also have spring rolls, egg rolls, dessert, and bubble tea. And wifi is available, if you like to sit and be online while you eat. Make sure to get a punch card for a free bubble tea and a free sandwich.",1
"YUM! finally tried this place after hearing all the good reviews. Ordered take out dinner: got the fried chicken sandwich with fries. Let me tell you it was moist, delicious and I want more! Definitely very filling and fresh! The bun they put the crispy fried chicken on was soft and just perfect for the sandwich. The fries were also good but definitely the star of the dish was the sandwich it was so good. I cant wait to try more here and definitely wanna stop by for brunch! I will be back!",1
"I cannot believe that I have not wrote a review for Big Wong King! shame on me!! well let's just start of by saying Oh Em Gee! Big Wong king is my absolute FAVORITE Chinese restaurant in all of New York, well, let's just say outside of china, because I doubt any Chinese restaurant other than in china will come close. I am not a normal eater. I don't want egg rolls, I don't want beef and broccoli, I want the real deal and the uncommon. I want the real Chinese food. Becoming bored with the restaurants in Chinatown, my bf did some research and Voila! before I knew it I was standing in front of Big Wong King. I trust him, so I know it was going to be good! Known for it's meat over rice dishes and their congee, we were in for some good eats! without a doubt I was ordering the two meats over rice. I decided on the duck and roast pork and of course I have to have a fried egg on top. the bf ordered the same and roast pork congee. literally in seconds the food is served. that's not always a good thing in most cases, but in this instance it is! BEST DUCK EVER!!!!!!! everyone I have ever brought here has said the same. the roast pork was yummy as well. I love how the sauce drippings from the duck runs all over my rice and makes it taste even better. I always ask for a little side of ginger sauce that they usually serve with chicken, but I like it for everything. I have to say the roast pork congee is super flavorful as well. congee wasn't always my thing, but Big Wong King makes it good!. Wait Folks! it gets better!! they also have a special. yep. a special. two lobsters with ginger and scallions for 20 bucks!!! the portion is huge!! and absolutely delicious! who in their right mind gives you two whole lobsters for 20 bucks?! nobody! that's why they raised it to 24.00 dollars now lol. but that's still cheap! I have also switched my plate up and now get the duck with the ribs..no words. but ughhhh. Big Wong King, you do everything right. I think what I love most is how loud it is in there. Asians yell, but these Asians yell louder than most, and I enjoy it lol. I also love how cheap it is. I never spend more than 25 dollars when I eat there and it's always a feast. This will forever be my spot for duck, unless an Asian friend of mine has a little grandma that will cook some killer duck, then I might have to update this review, but until then.... XieXie Big Wong king, you are the bomb!",1
"Salinas inspires a whole range of intense emotions. Fear, because you're nearly 15 minutes late and you know they will give your table away (like they did the last time). So you run in anxiously, and see your friend sitting right by the doorway, patiently waiting with a smile. You hug her quickly as she stands up and speaks to the hostess in one sophisticated swoop. TaDa! You've made it just before the buzzer. Joy, because the glorious main dining room feels like an airbrushed still when you walk to your table. Still catching your breath from the ""walk"" from the subway, you immediately notice elegant bouquets of pink and white roses and tall candles and other pretty stuff in the middle of the room. Â And because the food, though salty in some areas (probably your own fault for ordering both appetizer and entrÃ©e that contained Murcian cheese), is just above decent, somewhat justifying the steep price that you know you'll pay. Love, because as the meal comes to an end, you realize you've enjoyed everything, especially the chocolate and pistachios dessert: the epitome of a molten chocolate cake with homemade pistachio gelato. What is there not to love? Jealousy, because as you're leaving, you find yourself staring at the anxious people, packed in the sexily decorated modern lounge waiting to uncover Salinas' riches. You force a smile, as you remember the gracious owner sincerely thanking you for coming.",1
"My friends and I came here for dinner on a weeknight, and we took advantage of their great happy hour (half priced drafts, woo!), and then sat down to order food. Unfortunately, the great value didn't extend to the food menu, but I enjoyed the offerings anyway. I opted for the cauliflower custard entree, which came with caramelized onion farro and roasted broccoli. Although it sounded like health food, the custard was extremely rich and definitely satisfied me. Others at the table got the corned beef tongue plate, the brussels sprouts, and the spoon bread as a side. The brussels sprouts really are just brussels, though they are delicious, so be aware that it won't be a real meal. Basically, my friends found that the portions of the non-entrees were delicious but small, and afterwards we went to a pizza place since they were still hungry.",1
"Shroomtown = most delicious pizza I've ever eaten. I didn't get a chance to try their others, but I will definitely be back here next time I'm in the area just for the shroomy deliciousness. I love the thin crust and topping combo.",1
"This place feels like the culinary version of ikea. 2 stars is probably not enough because i loved that they have large pre-packaged meat for a charcuterie - and they were BOMB!! But navigating through the crowd to get to the goods wasn't a great experience. But I can't give 3 stars bc my experience was not good enough to be considered, A-ok!",1
Ended up here again somehow. I had the pork taco this time. I still thought it was average at best.,1
"A friend of mine kept raving about this place, so after almost a year of him repeating the same plead to go, my gf and I finally made the venture out to Greenpoint to check it out. I've been in the city for 5 years now and this is hands down the BEST gourmet pizza in NYC. 5/5, 10/10, 2 thumbs, 4 stars, don't care what measurement you use to judge food, but the pizza at this joint is beyond words and is a must try! Originally ordered two pies (Hellified Porkpie White & Hometown Brisket), both we're amazing and even ordered a third (Porkypineapple). All delicious and hard to stop eating. The owner is an interesting cat and checked in on us before and after the meal. Very easy to see his passion for pizza! (He also looks a little bit like Larry David)",1
"I spied 3-4 spots in which to stand & enjoy your pizza, but My Pie is really a to-go type of joint. Mozzarella slice ($3.27) was tasty through and though...just enough sauce, stringy cheese, thin, chewy crust. Textures were on point. Perfect with a dusting of garlic powder. My super nice pizza guy cut my slice in thirds, making it more lady-like to walk down the street while stuffing my face with pizza! Not what I'd call a typical NY pizza, but delicious & definitely worth another stop next time I'm in town! Great find!",1
"I really dig this place. It has amazing ramen noodles and divine pork buns that, for my money, beat out those at momofuku. The space itself is lots of fun, as in, hip, modern, good looking, asiany. We had to wait for about an hour, which I am starting to see might be standard for ramen places. The cocktails were great as well. The table set up..it's a bit odd because you will be sharing a large table with groups of other people. But that's part of the fun now, isn't it? We split a pork ramen, and the noodles were amazing. They had to have been home made. Broth was spicy. Definitely enough for 2 not very hungry people to split.",1
"Super duper! I have been at least 20 times for brunch, lunch, dinner and late night tapas. Brunch is my fave. I've had almost every dish, all wonderful, every time... Cocktails are heavy hand pours, Sangria is refreshingly soothful and you can't go wrong here. Service - excellent, attentive waitstaff + bussers Food - excellent quality + portion The only 2 things people might not like is that it can get quite noisy at prime time dinner hours, as there is nothing to absorb sound. Beautifully painted too... and even though it's a Latin place, they don't have any good salsa or hot sauce - only Tobasco (which is peppery vinegar, blah).. Love the Yuca!!",1
"Sorry, but I can't give rave reviews to this place. Â Too dingy for me. Â Just can't go back. Â I mean, if I were starving and I had to watch every penny, then yes, I'd go back. Â But this is NY, and there are so many choices, so little time! Â I Â got a takeout of vegetable noodles and chicken dumplings. Â Both good. Â But won't be going back when there are so many cleaner restaurants.",1
"To those who enjoy quantity - this place really isn't for you. The tapas portions are very small. If you're famished and want a ton of food shoved down your throat, either don't come here or expect to shell out $70 a head - and that's not counting drink. To those who enjoy quality - welcome to paradise. Eleven dollars for sauteed veggies is ridiculous but it's backed by perfect execution and flavor. Exquisite foods aren't meant to be eaten in huge bites. The bacon-wrapped dates were good as usual - strong in flavor and curious in texture - but the scallops with corn was absolute heaven. Â You also will not go wrong with their queso/salted meat platters. The sangria was actually a tad disappointing - in that it was nothing to sing home about. Boqueria - great for dates or with a friend, great for ambiance, great for experience, not so great on the wallet.",1
"Fish is a phenomenal seafood haven for seafood lovers. The value of food quality to price is the biggest thing you'll have I consider when choosing Fish. A party of four can walk out with less than 150 including tip which includes four entrees and three red/white/blue oyster beer combos and more beer on top of that. I recommend the garlic butter mussels with fries. Finish the mussels then throw the fries into the sauce and spoon out the fries and enjoy. Also, they had the best blue point oysters I've had in years. Maybe that's because I can't find good oysters in California. Go to Fish you won't be disappointed!",1
"I turn up the back light on my monitor as I write this review only because I am having flash(less)backs of how I couldn't see a damn thing in this restaurant, and I am only 35 years old. Â We walked in and, with the Halloween decor at the entrance, I thought I was entering a haunted house. Â It doesn't make it any easier to maneuver through the restaurant when their (tiny) tables are strategically placed to bang your shin at least three times. After the game of finding your table in the dark I sat down and was handed a long menu...ha!! Â Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice..whatever George W. said. Â I turn the brightness up on my phone to see the menu and then order some fun, yet unhealthy, appetizers. Â If I were to go back, which I would not, I would order only tapas-styles hor d'oeuvres and some wine--I guess since their choices were marginal at best. Â Unfortunately, we order the pollo de orno (baked chicken) with rice and beans, which the server said was his favorite when he brought it to us. Â Is every plate he bring a table his favorite??? hmmmmm... The best part was when we asked for a to-go bag and the server placed it right on top of the uncovered candle! Â Well played!! Â Are you trying to burn the place down and find a new job in this recession?? Â Good luck with that!!! Â Thank goodness the lady at the next table ""alarmed!!!"" us to the fact that our bag was now on fire--single alarm at this point (does that mean I can still put it out?)... Â After smothering (okay, it wasn't that bad) the flames we ran out of the place before we tripped over something on the way out, like a fire extinguisher, or at least I would hope... Buen provecho panitas y chamos!!!!",1
"I was excited to try this place specializing in ""hand-pulled Lanzhou beef noodle soup"". Â I ordered the ""house special"" with oxtail, beef tendon, and some other stuff. Â Also ordered the Fujianese wonton soup and shared the steamed dumpling. Â  The noodles were pretty good, but I think mine weren't cooked long enough. Â I felt my broth was slightly bland, and the meat itself could've been better quality. Â The wonton soup was tasty, the wonton had far less skin than wonton I usually have, but were cooked perfectly, and dumplings were good. Overall, it was pretty good, not great. Â My friends love their ""hot 'n spicy"" beef noodle soup and always order that, so maybe I'll try that next time. With the menus posted on the wall only written in Chinese, no other decor, and the Chinese lady screeching at the cooks and customers, I had to admit a felt a little out of place when I first walked in. Â I was relieved to see they actually had menus for us ABCs =)",1

"Still tasty. Â I was very much ""wow""d my first visit here a few months back and in comparison during my second visit, I thought my first visit had more unique menu items (like lamb from either New Zealand or Australia) and now the menu is more streamlined and slightly more generic. Â The cocktails are fantastic, and the ambiance is great, but I'm a little saddened that the menu isn't ""unique"" enough to bring me back for a third visit.",1
"I had the Manly burger which was just OK. Â The patty is pretty small compared to the bun and it was falling apart. Service was lacking. Â We ordered drinks, then our food. Â Two minutes later we are presnted with three dipping sauces and told how awesome each one is. Â Problem was we had nothing to dip. Â We were starving and this was a tease. Â There's no reason to bring out the sauces prior to any food. Burgers came next. We ordred fries but they came out last after we were almost done with the burgers. All of the burgers were ordered medium rare but one of them was overcooked. Â They could do better on the timing of the food delivery. Â No reason fries, burgers and sauces can't come together.",1
"Delicious and satisfying. You get to pick from a list of 5-6 base ramens that comes with its own topping but there is also an additional listing of toppings in which allows you to customize. Being the over-greedy ramen eating person that I am, I started with the Spicy ramen with Pork, added a boiled egg, spicy bamboo and extra seaweed. My friend and I also ordered the Ahi Tuna (marinated in sake maybe?), which was also really the bomb diggity. But be sure to go early if possible, with minimal seating areas in the restaurant, the line gets pretty backed up.",1
"Our first restaurant in NYC last week, and it was an amazing find! Â 5 stars for the neatest little hipster taco joint in the Lower East Side!! Â Albeit they can only seat about 30 people max, this little hole-in-the-wall (literally) restaurant is one of our best finds in the city (located on Houston & 2nd Ave). We started with their guacamole, which was so smooth (a bit unbelievably smooth) and fresh. Â Their hot salsa (you have to request it) was really tasty too! Â We ordered margaritas that were strong as hell but had a little umbrella in them. Â  Those tacos,,,, my gosh, those tacos,,,, are all excellent. Â We ordered one of each: pork carnitas, skirt steak, pork belly, and lamb. Â They were rolled in homemade corn tortillas and each topped with something just a bit different to bring out the flavor in such a great way. Â  My favorite was the pork taco topped with onion relish & cilantro. If I could move this little taco joint to Raleigh, I would do so in a heart beat.... I need more of this in my life :)",1
"Tight seating inside and hard to get in without a reservation. This place never appealed to me enough to plan ahead for it, but I had been disappointed that the two or three times I had tried, the hostess told me to expect at least an hour long wait. However, I was able to sneak right in to a table on a Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised. The hotpot was tasty, presented in a simple, yet elegant way retaining a lot of the character of my admittedly uninformed perceptions of the setting of a hearty Japanese meal. Anyways, the food was very nice. If I had to critique anything, it would be that the tonsoku appetizer actually didn't have much meat on it. This was especially disappointing because the sauce it was glazed in was delicious. As for the hotpot, we got the one named after the restaurant and were not disappointed. Spicy enough to cause some forehead sweat and make the cold beer improve, and the greens tasted rich and fresh. All in all, not amazing, but I admire the quality and unpretentiousness of Hakata Tonton. It is very good food, executed with humility. And for dessert when you're paying the check, you'll be reminded (if you did not first see it on the menu), that no tip/service charge is expected as the waitstaff are compensated an appropriate wage without gratuities. Although they attribute it to Japanese custom, I wish that more restaurants would adopt this practice in NYC. The service was excellent, but not in the aggressively friendly/tip hungry way...just professionals who knew how to attend to a table. You really can't ask for a whole lot more in a restaurant.",1
"I am so glad I found this place. The maximum price on the menu is basically 3 bucks. It's amazing. You can get 5 dumplings for only $1!!! And these things are huge!! They're not just tiny little potstickers you buy at the store. No, these things will definitely fill you up. Not only that, but it was all so delicious. I can't wait to come back here.",1
"I had a great experience here. I came here with a friend on New Year's Eve. We placed in our orders and received our food. We had already started our meal when the waitress came over and asked us if we were willing to move to another table to accommodate a group of six that just came in. The place is small and there isn't much seating so if we said no, the group would probably have to wait until we were done with our meal. She stressed that it was totally up to us. With a bit of awkwardness, we moved to another table. When the check came, the waitress took the beer off our tab. That was nice and we left on a good note. The bacon is very good. Thick and crispy. I love the thin fries. They were crisp... not soggy like the McDonald fries. Chipotle mayo was very tasty. I usually dip my fries with ketchup but I used the mayo instead.",1
"I've been to this place twice, just to give it a chance. The first time, an overrated, loud brunch with food that was fine but nothing special. But then, dinner. The food: actively bad. The service: ridiculous even for Brooklyn. First, we took a corner seat with cushions, and though the restaurant was basically empty, were relocated to another table by the waitress who claimed the table was reserved for a larger party. As dinner wore on we realized that the ""reservation"" was for the staff, who used the table to have their own dinner and sort through silverware while ignoring paying customers. Then, we got an appetizer in the form of a bowl of cut pickles that looked like it was the leftovers from another table. There was MAYBE one pickle cut up in there. To the credit of a certain Mark who was probably the shift manager, he caught this happening and filled up the bowl and apologized with a half-bottle of pinot grigio. There are many good mediterranean and Israeli restaurant across the city's boroughs, some are better than others. Miriam's food is plain embarrasing. The baba ganoush barely edible. When you get a half-bottle for free and you're still extremely disappointed by a meal, Â you know this is a place to which you will never return, and about which you have to tell others so that they don't make the same mistake.",1
"Came down around 8 pm on Sunday for dinner--no lines, no problem. Jetlagged brother and I split a bottle of chianti (under $30!) and a plate of deep-fried artichokes (very tasty and, luckily, not breaded as I expected) which sat among vines of crispy parsley. My tagliatelli pasta special, mushroomed, oiled, and garlicked up, was very good. The bro's red sauce gramigna pasta with peppers and sausage was also pretty good, according to him. It's also a pretty restaurant, well suited for a romantic dinner without splurging. Great values all around.",1
"One of my new fav's. The Brooklyn Star has plenty of seating, good food and a great ambiance. Our group ordered Mac & Cheese (freaking awesome), Jalapeno Bacon Cornbread, Fried Duck Wings, Kale Salad and Biscuits. The food was very good and seasoned perfectly. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. Great spot for groups, a frend or two and date night.",1
"I was here for dinner. While the place has a nice setting and is hidden from the mainstream, the food was a bit a let down and sake is very expensive. Food - 3 First, the place has no sushi. It's different Japanese food. This is ok, but people should know before expecting to find various sushi. The portions are tiny. They have a variation of cold and hot dishes and they are all fairly small and you need to take 3-5 to be filled. Noodle dishes take 40-50 minutes to prepare. They warn you, but we didn't order because of that. Now about the food taste. Some food tasted well, but at least 3 dishes we ordered were very bland and nothing special. Atmosphere -4.5 The atmosphere is cool. The place is nicely decorated in a Japanese style. It's located in a basement, which I'm impartial about and think it adds a little exclusivity to it. Service - 5 Very good service. Fast, friendly and willing to explain. Our server warned us against a certain dish. Value - 2.5 Food is fairly priced given the location. The food is sort of average and the dishes are very small with prices between $6-15 for hot and cold dishes. Other: Sake - 2 This place is famous for its choice of sake. I'm very disappointed, however. They have a huge choice, but there is no explanations in the menu about what each sake is like. Second, the server didn't offer us to try any sakes (i hear that's common from other reviewers). Third, Sake is very expensive and you get very little of it.",1
"5 star for Buta Kakuni, maybe 3.5 to 4 for everything else. It is really amazing, you can just order it with a rice and beer and will make your night.",1
"Came here with a buddy on an early Sunday night. First off, this is place huge - cavernous comes to mind. Â The decor is really cool, a sort of odd modern barn feel... 5 stars for setting. The menu is pretty broad and not that simple to navigate. Â We started with the spicy garlic wings which were AWESOME. Â I've been to Bon-Chon and Mad for Chicken - Barn Joo can definitely compete. The Kimchi pancake was tasty but very greasy. Â The bulgogi pot was okay but nothing special. Finally, we ended with the NY Style Sam Hap, which is described as ""Brined skate wing, caramelized Kimchi, double cut bacon, wasabi aioli, spicy soy vinaigrette"" This sounded great on paper, but I might have been underestimated that ""brined"" key word. I'm not sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did (some googling tells me that fermented skate is a popular, if acquired, dish in Korea) but it was literally inedible. The fish was very tough (meaning was difficult to cut even with a knife) and taking a bite tasted like opening my mouth in the atlantic ocean. Â Both me and my friend couldn't handle more than one bite. Â For the record, I have a very adventurous palate and like almost anything. Â I couldn't even stomach 2 bites of this. While is was dissapointing that the final and most expensive dish was by far the worst, overall, Barn Joo is a cool/trendy new Flatiron spot, and I would go again for some wings and beer, but most likely nothing else from the menu.",1
"You People Enjoy Waiting On Line, Don't You? I work in Midtown, down in the mid-40s, and have no shortage of food carts to choose from for lunch, including halfway decent halal carts (which I will eat at if it's raining or something), but every week I make a point to hike up to 53rd for some Halal Guys. Â Every time, as I walk past the mind-boggling lines at the 53rd and 6th locations, I wonder to myself ""Don't you people know there's another Halal Guys cart at 53rd and 7th?"" Â As I walk up to the 53rd and 7th cart, I see, sure enough, the secret is still safe. Â In and out in 2 minutes. Â It's almost ironic that the cart closest to the Wretched Hive of Tourism and Villainy known as Times Square gets the least amount of foot traffic. Not that I'm complaining! Â If anything, I'm almost afraid to post this, as I don't have the time nor inclination to walk 10+ blocks and stand in some godawful queue. Â BUT, I also don't want them to shut it down, so it's worth risking that a few people will chance to read this and give the 53rd and 7th cart a little love. The food itself is, of course, just super. Â Protips: They say ""white sauce"", you say ""hell yes!"", and take the hit of spicy sauce, you wimp! Â And the portions are large enough that you can eat half one day and finish it the next day, which is 2 delicious lunches for less than $3! Â Beats a peanut butter sammich any day!",1
"Brooklyn commune is a really great joint. Â They serve everything from breakfast, brunch, lunch dinner and cafe time. Â My favorite is torn between their lunch and dinner, for lunch the classic BLT is hands down the best BLT I've had, they use guacamole which takes the sandwich to a new level. Â Their dinner is quite nice and they really should price it higher, the menus is every changing so current recommendations, plus it's BYOB so if you're looking for a nice dinner out but not wanting to spend a lot, this is a wonderful place. Â Plus they have great service, very relaxed, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Â One thing to know ahead of time is brunch on weekends gets pretty crowded and often with young families. Â One last thing, I work here during cafe hours and I'm never hurried out for taking my time or even staying after I'm finished.",1
"I use to work blocks away from the cart and I really miss it. Couple of days ago I walked for 15 min just to get to eat it for lunch.. Yes you can say that I am obsessed. Putting the calorie content aside, this is freaking amazing meat. I've never had the chicken but the lamb is always good. For junk food, I search for consistency, and this place is very consistent. White sauce paired with a bit of hot sauce (they are really hot and i LOVE spice food, they are a 4/5 hot for me) The rice is a nice break from the meat and the sauce. Great drunk munchies. This is the kind of food that apparently people would literally ""kill"" for if you jump someones spot int he line. The wait is a bit long sometimes, especially in the evening. Try to go around 11:45 before the lunch crowd.",1
"Went on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Â They open at 12, we got there at 11.50am and were first in line [I think this is rare, but since it was rainy, there was less of a crowd]. Â The doors opened at 1pm. Â At this time, there were about 30 people in line behind us. Â  The people behind us in line were really rude, pushy and obnoxious - but this doesn't reflect on Di Fara's at all. Â Di Fara's staff was very nice and super friendly. Â I think they messed up our order, but we were so excited about the pizza, we didn't care. There are three tables that each seat 5 people. Â But there are extra chairs so technically you can squeeze about 7 to a table ... in general people are very friendly and getting Di Fara's pizza is an adventure/experience. They are BYOB, so you can bring your own wine/beer which is nice. Â Just don't forget to bring your own bottle opener Â  The Pizza - is absolutely amazing. Â We got 4 pies, and all were perfect. Â They have square and round pies. Â I personally like the crust and texture of the rounds better. Â But the square was perfectly done as well. Â The square had a thicker crispier crust, I've heard since it takes longer to cook, sometimes it's burnt, but ours was cooked perfectly. Classic Round - just cheese, basil and olive oil - sooooo simple yet so delicious. Â  Garlic and Pepperoni - garlic is to die for! Pepperoni is thick small cuts, Love it! Veggies and Sausage - veggies add a nice touch and the sausage is fantastic Square Sicilian - was much thicker than the rounds - at the time it was my least favorite of the four pizzas we got, but we were also the fullest at this time. Â Ate some room temperature left overs a few hours later, and this was my favorite ... Love this place - easily the best pizza i've had in New York thus far - and the three others i was with agreed. Â I defiantly would come back and recommend to others, you just have to have the mindset that it's an adventure. Â Don't go when you're starving and expect pizza immediately. Â  Pizza is pricey - our 4 pizza's cost us $130, but I think it's totally worth it! Â We also had left overs that reheat well and are still very delicious! Bring lots of cash, as it's cash only!",1
"I have only been here once but I really cannot wait to go back. Really loved the selection of food here, and from the reviews I have read on here, I definitely should be ordering a sausage next time. The fries are incredible, the pretzels are awesome, and the drinks are amazing. There is always some good seating, and a great winter bar. I cannot wait to come back in the summer as well since it seems like a great summer night bar. The bartenders are really friendly and awesome to talk to as well.",1
"I was expecting a quieter experience but I had no idea the bar scene was so popular at 1030 on a Thursday night. Black Label Burger was very good but not $26 good. The blend of beef made it, but I wish they would change the bun. Sesame seed bun was not doing it for me. If you come later in the evening don't expect a quiet experience. Glad I got to try the buger but I don't think I'll be coming back. Wife had the porchetta which was a-ok.",1
"Great food, their eggs benedict is on a buttermilk biscuit which was delicious, and their pancakes were amazing. Â Brunch comes with a free mimosa although we had to ask for it. Â Our only complaint was the waitress who was not good, but everyone else we dealt with was good.",1
"I wish this place was closer to me! I made a bar visit since I had a Brooklyn Passport, and the bartender was very nice and chatted with us about the various drinks and what we might like best. My date mentioned to him that she never knows what to order at a generic open bar type situation and how stressful it is, and he made her a Martinez which she LOVED. Though we didn't try the food I would definitely go back for a dinner date. If only it was closer to the R train!",1
"There is nothing I love more than going to an Italian restaurant where the owners/waiters/staff actually speak Italian. The rustic, charming decor of this place + the fact that the waiter called me ""my darling lady"" just set the mood right from the start. They have a great wine list, but I just had a crisp glass of house pinot grigio. For an appetizer, we had the mussels which were very large and incredibly fresh. The chicken cutlet is a very large portion, so I would advise sharing. I had the pesce(fish) of the day, which happened to be sea bass. It was served with a shaved fennel salad that was great. It also came with some kind of cooked red cabbage. I wasn't a fan b/c I found it to be greasy and oily. The fish itself was again, super fresh, and well cooked with a crispy, buttery skin. I didn't have pasta because it was during Passover, but next time I come I certainly will.",1
It's a place where u wanna satisfy your Korean food cravings and wanna eat different varieties at an affordable price. The food was good. But one thing I am not ok with is about their oily tongs. I hope they can have a better way of putting the tongs.,1
"Okay. For me, the perfect xiao long bao should have: thin yet firm dumpling skin. Clean, savory, hot broth. Juicy, flavorful, tender meat filling. It seems so simple but lots of XLB places only have some of these qualities, and some come extremely close to perfection, while others just do not even bother. Joe's pretty much has all of the above. And I live in Arcadia, so I frequent Din Tai Fung (for those who are in the know) and they also pretty much produce the perfect XLBs. But I like Joe's just a taaad bit more......................... :O I think it has a sort of rustic quality to it that makes it more comforting. Their xlbs got that delicate thin skin that's somehow able to hold in that savory broth, which is absolutely important because if the skin is too thick/doughy then it might as well be bread. And their hot sauce/chilli oil! Dude it's so tasty and spicy. Perfect with a bit of vinegar and that hot soup and filling ohhhhman. It's so delicious. You can slurp the soup out then eat the dumpling, or let that whole thing explode in your mouth (sounds dangerous doe)... any way you do it, it's so so good. My bf and I ordered 2 rounds of pork xlbs and 1 plate of fried dumplings. Their fried dumplings are super bomb too, but a little bit oily. Between 2 of us, it was the perfect meal on a cold rainy day. We came at an awkward time so the restaurant was only half full, but we were seated in a 6-people table with 2 other diners. They really try to make the most out of their space I guess. I don't really care about seating arrangements lol, but might throw some people off so be prepared to sit with strangers! Also, the lady we shared a table with was quite a starer. I'm not sure if it's cos I'm so beautiful or cos I was eating like a pig or what... but that didn't stop me from chowing down. Anyway, cheap, delicious food. We didn't bother with any other menu items, so I can't recommend anything else.",1
"Giovanni's is a perfect blend of old-school and upscale Italian fare. It takes the most appealing elements from each and the result is memorable and satisfying. We came for the first time for dinner last night and adored it instantly. The decor is fresh, simple, uncluttered but stylish and inviting. The wine list is small, well-chosen, and very affordable. The Rosso Toscana we picked for $32 was everything a Tuscan red should be- silky and smooth- and complemented the meal perfectly. We had a really hard time choosing what to eat because the menu, and the long list of specials, all sounded so good. You have a lot of options in terms of lighter or more hearty, Grandma-style fare, so it should be amenable to most everyone. I noticed that they have whole wheat and gluten-free pasta on request if you choose it. We did not, and are going to make another trip to try out their homemade pasta next time. Much like the decor and the frank, prompt, and unpretentious service, the food is just flat-out, no b.s. good. The vitello, served Milanese-style, was breaded and fried just right, with a wonderful tomato salad on top. Their meatballs are velvety, in a bowl full of marinara that you want to drink, with a dollop of ricotta and basil ribbons that put the whole thing over the top. Their salads were great, even the side of broccoli was perfectly cooked- not overdone, really green with a hint of garlic and lots of fresh lemon to squeeze. We were eating off the effects of the night before, as it was New Year's Day, so we went for heavier things, but the only regret I have was that I didn't get the branzino special, too, which was roasted skin-on and elegant beside a beautiful tangle of baby arugula, glistening with good olive oil. I don't usually write such long reviews, but we enjoyed our night so much there that I wanted to make sure I gave a more detailed description. We've had much costlier meals that weren't half as good, for that alone I would encourage you to go try it. We are already planning our return. :)",1
"The best thing here is the couscous, it was really good. The hummus on top was the best. I also tried the Hachi, which is like a shepherd's pie. It was okay, there are better places for that. The only thing i don't like about the place is it is cash only.",1
"This place gets a real interesting crowd because of their rock bottom prices. We saw a crowd of bike messengers having dinner at about 10:30 outside the place, almost knocked over one of their bikes while opening the door - thought I was gonna get shanked. But it was no biggie. $1 for 4 dumplings, $2.50 for a sesame ""pancake"" (more like fluffy sesame pancake serving as sandwich bread, with good fixins in the middle, like roast duck, hoisin sauce, and scallions), $4 for 8 wontons in hot chili oil. For $8.50, 3 of us ate like kings. You can't get this kind of quality for the price in New York. When given the choice between your average $1 slice and the 4 dumplings at Vanessa's, it'll be the dumplings every time.",1
"Their ramen is good, but I'd say this place is definitely over-hyped. It wasn't worth the 45 minutes I waited to get in. Soup base was okay, noodles a little bit overcooked. Didn't have the QQ texture that I like. I also had their Avo Tuna which is their torched tuna with avocado and garlic sauce. That was really good though, definitely better than their ramen.",1
"When I told my co-worker I was going to New York, he recommended I eat at Katsu-Hama. Â He makes regular tonkatsu-filled visits to Japan, but he always stops by Katsu-Hama when he's in the city. Â Thank you Tom, for the delicious tip. I went with a few co-workers for a work day lunch, and the place was packed. Â Luckily, it was an efficient operation built to accommodate New York's hordes of salarymen. Â Our party of four got seated at a counter, where we were presented with menus and a set of green tea, Japanese pickles, and sesame seeds with a pestle, almost as soon as we sat down. The food was fantastic. Â I ordered the katsu lunch, which came with white rice, miso soup, cabbage salad, and two beautiful golden brown cutlets of breaded and fried pork, all for $11. Â The tonkatsu was some of the best I've ever had, moist and meaty, with crispy, flavorful breading that didn't feel heavy in the least. Â The katsu didn't need much else, but the tonkatsu sauce poured over ground sesame seeds was wonderful, hearty with a light tang, and a smear of yellow mustard paste added a little wasabi heat to the mix. Â The rice and miso soup were great, and I even liked the shredded cabbage, though it was the only thing left on my plate when I was through. Â The katsu lunch was a good amount of food, but if you're very hungry, you can upgrade to a $16 ""surprise"" katsu lunch. Â It sounds better in Japanese - all it means is ""supersized."" I loved my tonkatsu, and I'll keep it on my short list for places to come back to in New York. Â Tom said the last person he recommended Katsu-Hama to went three times in a week-long trip. Â I had a mediocre lunch the day after my visit, and I rued the missed opportunity to go back for another meal of deep fried pork (I would have loved to try the katsu curry). Â A great quick lunch is surprisingly hard to find in midtown, but you can always swing by Katsu-Hama for destination tonkatsu.",1
"This place is a 5 for me, mostly because I absolutely love showing this place off to friends and visitors who brave the trip to Brooklyn from whatever borough they're in. Things to know: 1. They have an electronic wait list Go in and tell the host your name/#, and feel free to roam around. They don't always have this system in place, but they are normally pretty lenient about it - they're not like other places where you MUST be there when they call your name or you go to the back of the line. 2. The kale salad is amazing. It is one of my favorite things to eat, ever. It's delicious, and even if you don't like kale or salad, you will like this. It has pieces of tempura'd kale, along with crunchy sweet potato, golden raisins, and just an addictive dressing. 3. Different ramens have different noodles. I'm not a ramen pro, so I'm not sure what these noodles are actually called, but I know the pork bone ramen has a thinner, harder noodle than the miso ramen, which has a slightly thicker, softer noodle. 4. Go within 1/2 an hour of opening to avoid a wait. I am so, so, so lucky to live so close by, that on weekends I can wake up and walk to Chuko with no fear of a wait. Otherwise, I think the wait is around 15 minutes to an hour, depending on when you go. 5. Don't go with a gigantic group It's a pretty intimate area - it's not the most comfortable place to eat, unless you're lucky and get one of the side booths. 6. Cash only But don't fret, they have an ATM in store. One down side - sometimes the ATM can only spit out 50's, so just be aware of that. 7. Extra noodles are $1 extra. So, double the size of your meal for an amazing price! Although, I rarely ever finish the first bowl of noodles.. 8. Everything is delicious. I have been trying to eat my way round the menu, and so far, there isn't a single thing I haven't liked. My favorites are the miso ramen (I think it has more depth of flavor than the pork bone, and you won't even want to add the spicy garlic oil that they offer) and kale salad (must be said again).",1
"Great food. Good price. The brunch is great, as is the dinner. The Michelada options are amazing.",1
"Ahhhh the memories alone make this a 5* review. The Za and ice back it up. Hardcore! Four generations of my family have devoured the delectable Sicilian pies, and had buckets of Italian Ice at this Bensonhurst landmark. It was one of the first places my cousins and I were allowed to walk ""up the Avenue"" to while visiting Nonna; back in the days when kids could walk places safely. It is everything I miss about New York: real, simple, never changing, proud and authentic. Most rookies make the mistake of ordering the large Sicilian Pie and realize their eyes are bigger than their stomachs. For more then 70 years they have been serving up a righteous Pie and Spumoni (and a wide variety of other flavors) Italian Ice you just can't get outside the confines of NYC. Some go for the hype (which it blows away) others for the memories...sensory are indeed the strongest. It is the kind of place you go out of your way for, just for food you can't get anywhere else. In my book, if you are going to blow a carb wad, it should be on extraordinary food: L & B is that and more. Just go. Worth a subway trip, taxi ride, walk or drive: it is a true gem! Note: the cheese on the Sicilian is served under the sauce; the way most Nona's learned to make in Sicily. This is the only pie I don't order well done and is truly different from most others stateside. For some, this is good, for others: not so much. Yelp 100 Challenge",1
"I couldn't wait to review this place :D So we were in the neighborhood (which I am head over heels in love with), and happily stumbled upon this place. And by sheer magnificent luck we got a table!! My absolute favorite kind of restaurants are the good, old-fashioned fish restaurants - NOT seafood, there's a difference :) And this was one of them - the smell, the marble topped booths, the darkly lit interior the hustle and bustle of the oyster bar and the noise of the customers trying to crack open their crab shells. We started with the red, white and blue and decided they were delicious. However, we were both pretty hungry and ordered one of ""The Works"" which was King Crab Legs that came with 2 complimentary sides (we picked the garlic bread and the whipped potatoes). The whole dish was heaven in my mouth. The crab was just steamed and lightly drizzled with butter...I really don't know what else to say about it except that both of us stopped a couple of times to just briefly state how good the food was, and then went right back at it. The garlic bread was good, nothing out of the ordinary, but I was way too obsessed with the crabs to care anyways. After the crabs were dealt with, we proceeded to go for some more oysters to finish off the dinner (who needs desert anyway)? And the waiter was kind enough to suggest two very different kinds (forget the names) and we slurped them up right away. The service was great...prompt, polite and informative. Definitely bringing fellow fish loves here! And West Village...I promise I will be back soon.",1
"I'm not a huge ramen guy so I can't really compare this to anything else. This has been hyped up a lot for me since we moved to the area with people saying things like ""Oh you have to go to Ippudo, it's totally worth the wait!"". So we picked a Monday in Holidays thinking it would be quiet but the place was still packed! We were seated after about 30 minutes which was totally acceptable to me. The food was awesome. We got the pork buns which were amazing and a noodle dish each. The flavors were great, it was a well balanced dishs!",1
"I expected more from the reviews. The food was incredibly delicious (I had the yummy but a bit heavy avocado gazpacho and the braised lamb) but the service was terrible. The waitress asked us what we wanted to eat just a minute after handing us the menus, so we asked for a couple minutes. Well, that turned into 25 minutes. Then after ordering it took 50 minutes for the food to come! When it came time to pay, the waitress was again nowhere to be found. I usually like to have a cocktail with latin food, but the place was only beer, wine and sangria. The white sangria wasn't good. Not enough alcohol and it had a nasty after taste. Mushy fruit. There is only one table in the back patio, and it's probably pretty romantic sitting out there. But inside where we were sitting, it was poorly decorated, verging on ugly. I felt silly making a reservation- it's a big place and was mostly empty. I guess you have to lower your expectations for decor and swankiness when you're in Brooklyn...",1
Lovely organic and grass-fed spot right in the heart of Chelsea Market.,1
"Everyone seems to rave about this place, and while I think some of their food is solid, I've had much better middle eastern food elsewhere. Their falafel is their only redeeming quality. It's extremely light, airy, and crispy, and I especially enjoyed the green and harissa varieties. The red pepper flavor was a little too sweet and mild for me. And it's gluten-free to boot. I don't ever indulge in fried food because it doesn't make me feel great, but I acknowledge that taim makes very good falafel. Their sides, on the other hand, are extremely mediocre. The hummus is very much overpowered by the tahini, not allowing the integrity of the chickpeas to come through at all. The flavor is just ""off."" The moroccan carrots were nothing special, the israeli salad was pretty generic, and I wasn't a fan of any of the accompanying sauces. In my opinion, Hummus Place has WAY better sides, and their hummus is far superior. I think taim is extremely overrated, and wouldn't likely return.",1
"Very charming intimate atmosphere. There were a lot of Japanese speaking people here which made me think ""if Japanese people like it, then it must be authentic"" Black Sesame creme brulee Sesame is usually a very overpowering flavor but the black sesame and creme brulee was a very delightful surprise of deliciousness. Chocolate sou flee with raspberry sauce very very rich and fluffy. Two kinds of freshly baked scones like the chocolate scone but didn't eat the other one, we tried figuring out what the flavor was - we think it was a Taro scone.. hm.. I wouldn't recommend the scone. Assam tea great pair to finish with the desserts above Minus one star because it's Cash Only, No Reservations with a very very awkward waiting area.",1
"TOP FIVE DINING EXPERIENCE Best steak I ever had, wonderful service, cool yet unpretentious atmosphere. Reservations are not easily had, let's just say they aren't on opentable and you just can't call up- if you get the number. Entering through a door next to a graffiti covered storefront, you have no idea that a Japanese steak place would be at the end of that long hallway- well, yes you do, this is New York and we all know about going through phone booths to get into bars and standing on our heads and spinning three times in front of the Statue Of Columbus to get into Thomas Keller's secret speakeasy underneath the Time Warner Center...oh you didn't know about that one- you should go try it out, let me get my camera. So getting back to Bohemian, it is small- seven tables and a bar for four. As others have pointed out on here, it is like being in someone's living room. The chairs were fine for me, people have mentioned some awkwardness in trying to eat because the chairs were too low or something but I was fine. The service was really great- all smiles all the time, very gracious, made us feel welcome. The food: me and my wife each got the short rib sashimi, the foie gras sushi, we split the smoked bacon, and split a 13 oz waygu strip loin. The first three dishes were all great, and I loved everything- but the steak was not of this earth. It literally melted in my mouth. When you get a porterhouse or a ribeye, sure there is a ton of flavor, but you get a lot of fat and crap you can't eat. Every part of this steak was eaten, there was nothing left over. And I would say that one a scale of 1 to 10, the flavor would be a 9. I've had some steaks that were 10, but again, they would be very fatty or a little chewy. So to have a touch less of that beefy flavor and have a 10 in texture- that is my idea of a perfect steak. Yours might be different, but I guarantee you will love the steak here. And at $73 for 13 oz for a high grade piece- not bad.",1
I went here on a Saturday afternoon. Â Had brunch at the bar with a few friends. Â Cute place on the west side with friendly staff. Â The food and drinks were just OK though. Â I've had better in NYC.,1
"The staff here are super friendly! They smile all the time! I ordered the pork chop and tops vieja, which is shredded beef in tomato stew. The tomato stew was okay, the flavors were a bit too strong for my taste. I love the pork chops! The portions are HUGE! I got exhausted after the first pork chop, and the second one was an uphill battle for sure! Their plaintain side dish was a bit soggy so I was indifferent to it. My glass was never empty because they always made rounds to refill waters. This is rare for me because I drink a TON of water. It was the first time I had Spanish food and this place did not disappoint!",1
"basically, standing on the sidewalk at 2:30 in the morning eating amazing french fries with each friend holding another delectable source is really an unbeatable experience.",1
"This place was fantastic the first couple of times we went, but felt a little tired the last time. Â The sizzling sisig, coconut rice, and the green mango salad are amazing. Â The staff is cool and I love that the have cheap beer. Â Overall, a good place, but I hope they keep up the intensity and get rid of their B rating.",1
"We got to Pies n' Thighs at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon expecting to get a table. Unfortunately, we were sorely mistaken, for even in Brooklyn, it is impossible to beat the dreaded Saturday brunch crowd. In between sips of sweet tea and bites of buttered biscuits, the deep fried chicken hit the spot. Hot out the kitchen, we wasted no time worrying about the sodium and oil content, letting the sweet juices dribble down our chin as we bit into the perfectly crisped chicken. The batter is a delicate balance of sugary and salty, a tantalizing prelude to the meat which was cooked to just the right amount of tenderness. If you are willing to brave the throngs of hipster and endure the awful service atypical to Williamsburg, you will be rewarded with the greasiest, most juicy fried chicken your money can buy.",1
"I've been to Yasuda more times than I want to admit to my pocketbook, but I've waited until now to review because I wanted to make sure it was consistently the best sushi I've ever had--- well, my friends, Yasuda is the best sushi I've ever had (at least until I can afford a trip to Japan). Don't come to Yasuda expecting funky sauces and herb aiolis. The sushi is traditional, expect nothing but a celebratory fusion of perfectly prepared fish and seasoned rice dancing on your tongue. The chef tends to age his white fish and marinate some of the others (arctic char, salmon, etc.). The scallop, oyster, toro, eel, and uni are especially delicious. Guidelines: -Sit at the sushi bar, do not sit at the tables or you will have a lackluster experience. -Ask for head Chef Mitsuru Tamura, the rice in his nigiri is perfect. -Order omakase and let the Chef take care of you. -Order sushi not sashimi, the sashimi here is fresh but not that great. -End with the tamago - custard version. It's sweet, smooth, and the perfectly delicious way to finish your meal. -In true Japanese fashion, this restaurant has abolished tipping. When they give you the bill, just pull out your credit card as the tip is already included. Dinner will set you back at least $150 per person, but I promise, it is worth every pretty penny. **TIP: A sushi bar is typically ordered by years of experience, the most senior Chef at one end of the bar and the most junior at the other.",1
"30th and lexington that's what I signaled the taxi driver. As I pay the driver I get out and my mouth is already tasting the sweet Nutella, and juicy perfectly cooked bacon. All this and I haven't even stepped through the doors of the cute little restaurant called Penelope's. Â  Their Nutella French toast is amazing! And so is almost everything on the breakfast and brunch menu. For you bacon lovers out there the bacon is delicious (there's alternative bacon out there for you non bacon eaters). Penelope's is my new go to breakfast spot in NYC!",1
"Overhyped. Â The wait is long, and the restaurant is small and not super clean. Â The air conditioner was weak, so you sweat while eating your food in the summer. Â You do feel like you are in Asia when you walk in here, so I assume that people frequent this restaurant for its authenticity. Â Overall, I would avoid coming here during dinner hours or weekends. Â Always expect a wait, and don't believe the wait time that they tell you. Â We came on a Wednesday night at 6:15pm, and were told a 15-20 minute wait. Â We waited an hour. Â  The food: Totto Miso Ramen- Noodles are cooked to perfection. Â I had the chicken and was not impressed by my two slabs of chicken. Â Otherwise, the soup base is key and the reason I might come back. Totto Mega Ramen- Noodles are cooked to perfection. Â Lots of good meat, excellent soup base. Â A little salty, a little too many green onions.",1
Pig and Whao! Â big fan,1
"Great dinner at Boqueria. Â Nice atmosphere, young, lively, wonderful aromas floating around. We tried the creamy croquetas - to die for - especially the mushroom ones. Then the patatas bravas, which were very good but not extraordinary; lamb pinchos - great; lengua - very good but not all it was cracked up to be (I loved the potatoes that came with it though); then the croquetas on special - pollo and morcilla - good but I couldn't taste or see the morcilla. And I think by that point I had enough croquetas. Nice churros with dulce de leche for dessert but again reaching my tolerance for fried food. Â  Had a very nice red wine - all Spanish. Conversation would have been hard with more than 2 - a stretch as it was - but that's Sat. night for you",1
"From the line that extended throughout the doors and alongside of the building, I would say there would be long list of things that line out of my mind!!! So where do I start? First off, I liked the inside decorations and it wasn't crazily done or anything but very modest and enjoying to look at. Second off, the sunday Mimosas and Bloody mary's were pre made to order so that was something to start off a good morning with!!! Thirdly, the food, the food was so amazing that I know I've fallen in love with New York again while dining at Jane!!! My Plate I actually had the Toasted Ricotta Gnocchi and that was really unique and amazing with the perfect blend of taste from the presentation to the finish. My Friend on the other hand had a taste of the Benedict jane with crab cake which were decent but not beating my choice!! This establishment is really near Soho, so location location location you can do something else if your visiting around the neighborhood!!! Stay fresh, Bry",1
"ABC Kitchen is another Solid creation of Jean George... it both is homely and lively... Sometime a little too lively for a relaxing evening dinner. ABC Kitchen is right on 18th Street in the Flatiron district. Â It was late and we were craving to treat ourselves with a wholesome meal after some tiresome Christmas shopping... Â Looked on Yelp to see what was nearby lord and behold ABC Kitchen check to see if reservation was available. Â Lucked out someone cancelled. Â Whohoo... Â We snatched it and walked right in... It was 930 pm and it was swamped. Â It was a cute place, spacious and cheerful with a lot of light. Service was friendly and reasonably attentive. I started with a bloody mary my friend ordered a winter ale beer. Â It was spectacular. The bloody mary was thick, spicy and delicious - everything a bloody mary should be. The garnishes were also fantastic . Â We started with some appetizers the Green Kale salad and Fresh Fluke. Â Yummy the kale was fresh/crunchy/refreshing. Â  There was a hint of jalapenos and salt that went well with the salad. Â The Fluke was fresh and refined. Â It had a wonderful blend of garlic olive oil and spices. Â Then came the pasta with organic mushrooms Â We enjoyed this very much. Â The pasta was perfectly cooked and the ingredients were simple superb. Â  Thankfully, the appetizers were was also delicious. We shared an order of the Sea bass... It was good but for some reason it reminded me a lot of PF Chang's Sea Bass dish. Â Not that it was bad but it had a lot of similarities only difference was that the sea bass was so small. Â Somewhat disappointing. Â For dessert we ordered cinnamon apple tarts. They were warm and lovely, with good texture and not too much sweetness. the crispiness of the outer shell and warm gooiness of cinnamon and apple went well together.. Â  Be prepared to pay up our bill ended up being $200+",1
"Simply put, dinner at Marc Forgione was the best meal I've ever had! In order to properly laud this restaurant, I have to walk through the experience, from the top. Reservations--Recommended: Easy, through OpenTable. I've heard that it's nearly impossible to decide to eat here at the spur of the moment because it's so popular, so definitely do a bit of advanced planning. We booked a table for 5PM, which was nice because it was still light out, and we avoided the hustle of the dinner rush. Getting there: Multiple subway stops nearby, minimal walking, no problem. Arriving: The hostesses were attentive and greeted us promptly. Since we arrived a little early, we were led to the bar. The bar menus are printed on coarse fiber paper and covered in a distressed leather sleeve. (It's the little details that really sell me on the sincerity of a place.) I ordered the rum cocktail (local rum, blueberry, limoncello, sriracha), which was spicy and sour and woke me up a bit. Their wine list shows thought and purpose. When the restaurant officially opened, the hostess seated us outside, which was perfect because it's pretty dimly lit inside. On that note, the ambiance is rustic, with unfinished wood, rough edges and wrought iron. The light you eat (and pee) by is provided via tea candles. The Waitress: Our waitress was really polite and she enunciated well. She answered all of the questions we had, and could recall components of each dish very proficiently. Throughout the meal, she was attentive without being intrusive. The Meal: First out was a cute little watermelon and sesame bun appetite whetter served on a sliver of slate. Eating the two components together was a divine lesson in contrasting flavors, textures and temperatures. The table bread was tensile and moist, and the butter was seasoned and lightly salty. I ordered the chili lobster with texas toast to start, while the other people in the party ordered squash blossoms BLT (with goat cheese, bacon and black pepper balsamic). eggplant parm raviolo (with heirloom tomato, buffalo mozzarella and basil), kampachi tartare (with avocado, Sechuan buttons, toasted pine nuts and Saratoga chips). The lobster came spliced into sections, nested in a bitingly spicy, yet pleasing sauce. The squash blossoms were soft and delicate, and paired with the other components, was hearty. The raviolo was covered in a crispy crust, but the pasta underneath was optimally chewy. Of the appetizers, the kampachi was forgettable, maybe because I'm not a huge fan of completely raw fish. When at Marc Forgione, one must try Bell and Evan's chicken under a brick, served with yukon potatoes, broccoli rage and pan drippings. The skin was crispy, and the meat was succulent. The pan drippings accompanied the chicken perfectly, and I felt guilty brushing the cast iron pan to swipe the remaining juices. Yes, the chicken under a brick is everything you'll hope for and more, and you'll never want to order this dish anywhere else because none can compare. Also on the table was a Creekstone Farms 28 day dry aged ribeye tomahawk steak (with pommes fondant and carrot glazed carrot). The steak blew my taste buds away, as in, I would be happy to eat that steak at every meal if I could. Its surface was seared crispy, but not burnt, the innermost meat was still lightly pink, and it was dripping with flavor all the way through. As impressive as the steak was, the carrot stole the show. It was large and had apparently been simmering in a carroty-orange liquid. It was served on an oblong dish, which only made it look more formidable. To finish, we ordered 10 minute cookies and milk. The cookies were basic, but they'll surely appeal to the inner child in all of us. They tasted homemade and warm, straight out of the oven-style, but cookies can't really change our lives. The Experience: We booked the reservation thinking that we would check out the hype of an Iron Chef's restaurant, but we left with our lives changed. We have a whole new perspective on food, a new standard. Nothing else will taste the same again.",1
"Dishonest people are in this restaurant. My wife and I went to the brunch on Sunday 8/10/2014 at Casa Enrique in LIC. We paid by credit card and we added 19% tip to the bill. When I reviewed my credit card statement, I found out that the charge is not the same as what I paid on the receipt. Apparently they decided to take 25% tip. The food was so so. Nothing special. We don't plan to dispute the charge because it is not worth it for a few dollars. But we will not go back there because the people working there are greedy dishonest people who would fraud your tip amount. Be careful if you are paying by credit card at Casa Enrique. Check your credit card statement.",1
"I am obsessed with their ox tail hui mei (hand pulled noodles with ox tail in a lamb broth). The big tray chicken is also really good. I recommend getting takeout if you can- dining in is a super slow experience (takes about 20-25 minutes to get the food), and the decor leaves much to be desired.",1
"Umm, firstly, I saw John Oliver here, so that was... amazing. On top of that, the overall experience was pretty good. The paninis are large and probably one of the better values. When I got there, though, I was told that the ventilator had given out, so no flatbreads were possible. I saw people who beat out the ventilation and had good-sized pizzas, though, so I coveted those options. But I digress. Ambiance was fine, nothing amazing or frilly. Menu was decent. Service was fine. So, in the end, there's really not much that stands out. But I am glad I took a chance and ate here so I can share the same air with an amazing actor.",1
"I'm assuming everybody knows that Gramercy Tavern is a top restaurant, so I'm here to highlight something you may not be familiar with - their off menu lunch items. It's not the biggest secret in the world, but, when you sit for lunch at the bar or in the tavern area, your waitress will inform you of two items not on the menu - the soup and sandwich, and the Tavern burger. The burger is fantastic. Everything's made in house daily, from grinding the meat to baking the bread. There's a big slab of bacon, three types of onions, and a trio of house made sauces - ketchup, mustard, and thousand island dressing. The beef is grass-fed and full of flavor, the cloth-bound cheddar from Jasper Hills farm is a perfect compliment. One of the best (albeit pricey) burgers in the city. The soup and sandwich may be the best hidden gem in Manhattan. For a completely reasonable $16, you get a soup and salad that rotates weekly. These aren't half assed either - you can see the thoughtfulness in each bite. Over the past few weeks, I've been able to sample a pulled pork + balck bean soup, and a grilled mortadella + cauliflower soup. All four items for incredible. This is an amazing hidden gem with top class service, a beautiful bar setting, and incredible food for what amounts to an absolute steal at lunch.",1
cabbage w/ miso was okay...udon dishes were ehh....the salmon rice cakes baked were pretty good. I've had a whole variety of food here and none of it stands out to me. Pork belly is about average here..All the food was pretty standard and their soups were nothing to write home about. Not as good as st marks area food. Its more the fact this place is a lot better than sapporo and super close to me. They have their kitchen open until 2am and so if you want food thats not pizza that late..this would be the place to go.,1
"I love this place! To say it is magnificent would be an understatement. Never again can I just go and enjoy a taco anywhere. Los Tacos No. 1 literally ruined regular taco experiences elsewhere! Thanks Los Tacos! HaHa But no, seriously... I can't emphasize how remarkable their tacos and guac w/ chips are. They have an extremely fresh taste to them and they are quick. It is as if the items used to prepare the food were harvested or slaughtered earlier that morning. I can recall going to visit Los Tacos soon after getting both of my lower wisdom teeth removed. Did I know I was in for a challenge? Yep, sure did! Not a care was given! It literally took me an hour and a half to nibble through the continents of the two tacos. Listen to what I said, the contents, which means I completely skipped the nice fluffy corn shells. Guess what? I enjoyed every splendid second of it! Am I rambling? Yes! Why? Because I feel like an excited hyper little kid as I think about these amazing tacos. What tacos should you get? It doesn't matter! You can't go wrong so just go with whatever you feel like! The only tip will be to relax. Chelsea Market moves at a different pace. I always feel like I'm going 100mph when I enter because everyone is moving on a none NYC time. Try to walk extra slow and you will fit in with what seems to be majority tourist patrons.",1
"what i ate- fried macaroni and cheese, fried chicken and waffles, blueberry martini been here a few times over the years and always have a good time. they have a great patio that you can sit on to people watch while you eat. one time i sat in their lower level which i didn't like nearly as much, very dungeon like with no windows so i don't recommend that. food here is good. and there is a ton of variety available so anyone could find something to eat with no problem. this is not a great place to come if you are on a diet as a lot of the options are fried but man it is great for a hangover or preventing a hangover late night. i didn't love the mac n cheese but i am pretty picky on that front as a southerner. but i did really enjoy the fried chicken and waffles. it was a big portion so i was even able to share some with the rest of the table. drinks here are good so it is also a nice spot to come to booze and just snack on some apps. and anywhere good and open 24/7 earns points with me.",1
There was no wait on a sunday afternoon. I recommend the French toast and Croque Madame. It was quiet and cute inside. It reminded me of a cozy living room.,1
"I've only eaten here once but boy did they leave an impression. Found this hidden gem on Yelp, so I decided to wander to the city in search of some fine pasta for cheap (as they put it). I was prepared to find myself without a seat or waiting in some massive line that went around the block but to my delight, there wasn't any! The design of the place is really cozy, the lantern lightning and the small interior makes me feel like this is what pasta shops might actually look like back in Italy. I settled for some Chicken Alfredo and was rewarded with a free loaf of bread! I was very sad to see that I had cleared my plate so quickly, I almost went back for another round but I didn't want to seem like too much of a fatass so I just took their card and vowed to come back for more! My mouth is watering just thinking about this. ...bottom line, if you want a place that won't break your wallet and still have a good time on a first date or even with a small group of friends, Pepe Rosso is the place to go.",1
"Hands down one of the best places to go to for brunch. Â I enjoy every bite, and recommend you to try it :) Best wishes, V",1
"Ever since Bobby Flay challenged Clinton St. Baking Co to a throwdown and lost, I put blueberry pancakes on my bucket list. That was a few years ago, yet the hype and long lines still haven't died down. On a Saturday morning, we arrived 5 minutes before opening to discover a line that stretched to the end of the corner. Undeterred, we got in line and put our name down while the first seating was underway. The ipad sign in decreases congestion and disperses the crowd. Those who didn't know about the sign-up sheet were left unnecessarily waiting behind the crowd of the people. After an hour wait, we were seated and promptly ordered blueberry pancakes. Coming in groups of 3+ will make the wait even longer. They just don't have the space. How were the pancakes? They were definitely worth the hype! The pancakes were barely crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Combine that with the warm maple butter and you'll be in heavenly bliss. As we left, we overheard estimated wait times of 2 hours. If you detest early mornings and long lines, I would suggest coming for dinner instead. They still serve breakfast items in the evening, including the infamous blueberry pancakes. Better yet, they offer half off bottles of wine and Monday and Tuesday nights.",1
"I came here for brunch, it's in a very quite and cute neighborhood, it's a great spot for outdoor eating. However, the food itself is very typical and boring brunch food, nothing to write home about or worth going to again.",1
"If you're in the mood for Cuban food, this is a good place to go. A couple of friends and I sat at the bar to take advantage of the special--1/2 price appetizers and drinks. We tried the sampler platter (ham croquette, plantain chips, 2 empanadas, little Cuban burger, etc.), the calamari and the shrimp. All were delicious. Soaking the bread in the shrimp stew was heaven. The ham croquette was delicious. My favorite part by far was the garlic mojo sauce. We also tried their sangria which was good, but not super strong and not the best I've ever had. The rest of their entrees looked delicious, and I would definitely come back to try them. Overall, a good spot for Cuban in Alphabet City and close to my apartment, so that's a plus!",1
"We waited for literally 2hs for brunch on a Saturday at 11-12. They said the wait was going to be fore 2hs and it was. We had a banana walnut pancake. The sauce that they have on the side is THE best thing in the world. I also got the other plate that comes with eggs, bacon, biscuit, and potatoes. We also got cheese grits. I loved everything about this place, the attention was also good. If you have someone that is willing to wait that long to be with you, it is totally worth it.",1
"Grabbed some late-night snacks here last night and was super impressed. Â We sat at the bar and peeked inside their kitchen, which seemed well organized and well run, a nice touch when folks can see right into any bit of chaos. Â  The food was super tasty and inexpensive! Â The empanadas are a generous size and you could make a meal of it with a side of kale and rice and beans. Â In fact, this was what we did and we loved every bite! Â  The space is pretty huge and sparsely decorated, yet cozy in its own way. Â They had the front door wide open yet it was so warm in there thanks to amazing heaters. Â I liked the projections and live conga/music action, not too loud and added to a great vibe. Â  Can't wait to go back!",1
"My boss took me to ilili for my review lunch and both ended up four stars: very good but not crazy good. We got a bunch of small plates, shrimp and the hummus being stand-outs. Drinks were also tasty. I don't think you can go wrong with this menu - try everything, it's all quite sophisticated and tasty; a must in this neighborhood. Also, top notch service.",1
"The hype is real. A huge bowl of delicious hand-pulled noodles in a hearty beef stew with bok choy for only $5 and a huge plate of pan-fried dumplings for only $2... food aside, you can't get a better deal on a meal anywhere else in Elmhurst. The quantity of food is insane for how little you're paying. The food itself is great too, albeit, the prices are making me a bit biased. You are definitely not getting anything super fancy or high-quality, but you are getting really filling, well-cooked food. The hand-pulled noodles are the best! I've had hand-pulled noodles several times before and I must say, the chef in the back who does the pulling is one talented noodle puller! To get the noodles to such a nice consistency, to get the chewiness just right, to maintain the same width throughout, and to never have the noodles break... that's art! Everything else is decent, just elevated to greatness due to the sheer quantity and dirt cheapness. To be honest, the broth of the soup was a little too salty and a bit too heavy on the soy sauce for me. The bok choy wasn't as fresh as the bok choy I'm used to but I'm just being nitpicky. The meat was mostly bone and tendons but then again, you are paying next to nothing for a huge bowl of soup noodles. The pan-fried pork dumplings were great though a bit over-fried/dry in one or two corners (probably cause they were reheated). But, once again, for the price, I don't mind. These dumplings were large, filling, and nicely seasoned. All in all, the meal left my bf and I quite satisfied. I'd come back here just for the noodles! One thing to note: It's an ""order then seat yourself"" place and you clean up after yourself afterwards at the trashcans by the doors. On a slight tangent, the trashcan for dumping soup is quite interesting, with a metal mesh separator that hangs over the top to catch the noodles... I thought it was clever, but my bf thought it was a bit gross. *Shrug* Hey, I don't see any better way of taking care of soupy substances. Besides, they're graded A (something you don't see often in Elmhurst). Food: 3.5/5 -- Decent food, made exceptional by the cheap prices. The noodles, though, are fantastic regardless of price!! I'd recommend this place solely for their masterfully pulled noodles! Service: 3/5 -- Fast, attentive, friendly, and a huge plus that they hire workers who can understand and speak fluent English. You don't usually get that at small family-owned Chinese restaurants. Atmosphere: 3/5 -- Nothing remarkable. Just a small, slightly cramped, casual deli-esque environment. Overall: 3.5/5 -- I'd give this place a 4 if the environment was a little tidier but overall, it's a fantastic pulled-noodles shop with decent food all around for super cheap prices.",1
"Nice little sit down spot for Bahn Mi's and Bun in the West Village. It's got a real homey feel. It is my Vietnamese Friend's favorite Bun in NYC, she convinced me to get the Cat Fish and it definitely did not disappoint. Nice place for a casual quick meal.",1
"Not much to say about pie-n-thighs that hasn't already been said. Chicken box is off the chain, and my discovery of chicken and waffles here has certainly increased my cholesterol 10 fold. Cheese grits were on point, and the biscuit was not only gigantic, but delicious as well. The sour cherry pie was a nice finish on an outstanding meal. I would subtract half a star if I could because they do not take reservations, which I so desperately want for Mother's Day. Will return soon.",1
"Had really high expectations of this place so it's hard to be unbiased. 3.5 stars, it's not my favorite but I can see why everyone likes it so much. We were able to do a last minute walk in for lunch and the hosts were very accommodating. I was telling them I heard Martha Stewart comes here a lot and they were surprised I knew. I wish I took it a step further and said we were best buds haha. We ordered sushi and sashimi a la carte and the chiarashi (sashimi variety over bowl of rice) The ordering process felt a little confusing too because they had like 5 different types of mark it yourself menus for choose your own combos. The waiter was a little brusque which didn't bother us too much but could bother other people I think. What we ordered: Toro medium - very good but not the best we've ever had Shimaaji yellowtail - okay King salmon - one of my favs Uni - this should be why you come here, this was amazing and melted in your mouth Anago unagi - really delish, another fave Chirashi ume - great deal! Because the sashimi used is the same you get a la carte but was better value and the quality was the same. It was in this bowl, I thought the tamago was sooo delicious. I love eggs and can tell this tasted different from the standard tamago. Overall, I would definitely come again and it helps to know what and how to order since that can be confusing.",1
"The food is just as good here as the other Shake Shack locations in the city. Â This spot is conveniently located close to the financial district (10 minute walk), which is a welcome lunch spot! The lines move quickly and seating is generally easy to find.",1
"Great burger, good place to catch a brew and some sports. Awesome bartenders and one of the last OG bars in the West Village. Been coming here since I was a shorty with my mom when I use to split a bistro burger with my sister cause it was too big for either of to eat by ourselves. Nothing fancy here just a good old fashioned NYC burger. My favorite burger in the whole city! If you ever get the chance it's a great place to have a nice quiet lunch and read the paper. One of my favorite lunch spots in all of NY.",1
Great Banh mi's and great drinks. love this place.,1
Great happy hour special with great drink specials and they had yummy mussels dish with fries for $5 - I thought that's hard to beat. Â Definitely worth a try! Â Our server was also very attentive and she provided great recommendations!,1
For my Birthday I choose St. Anselms Hipster Steakhouse. Â Wasn't disappointed and as always I was stuffed and happy when I left. Â This time we went with one entree and like 5 sides and two apps. Â Good move(as I pat myself on the back) Â Great service...I'm 85% addicted to this place!!!,1
"came for sunday brunch. the name is fitting, literally just a little nook in the wall. tight space but yummy food. We got the eggs benedict with salmon. delicious. caveat: cash only, be prepared.",1
"Bo Ky (according to my parents) has been around for a while and continues to excel because of it's great food. I believe that Bo Ky involves the fusion of some Vietnamese and Chinese kind of foods. However, when I tried this restaurant with my parents, I have to say that I was not impressed (cue McKayla's not impressed face). I tried the zha jiang mien (bean sauce noodle), which made my stomach feel unsettled the entire time. I do have to say that the spring rolls and country styled chicken were above par though. Anyways, I am not impressed with this restaurant for the food quality which may have a little to do with how sanitary the restaurant is as well.",1
"New York may have a Japanese curry problem. Not a crisis, mind you, but a problem. It would sound pretentious to start off by mentioning that I lived in Tokyo so I know Â my J-curry, but...Okay, well, I do know my J-curry. Â Really, anyone with taste buds who Â has gone out for late nights in Tokyo and needed to sate their carnivorous needs can tell you how much a great plate of Japanese curry can make you whole again. Â  The place does not have to be fancy-smancy. Â You want a back-streets-of-Shibuya-feel to it. Â In the end. I've tried a few places in NY. Â The ones I've heard most about are Go! Go! Curry and Curry-Ya. Â The latter was disappointingly clinical in its approach. Â The flavors were muted, the meat felt generic, and the place itself had a sterile doctor's office vibe.... In other words, it was off the mark. Go! Go! Curry, on the other hand, felt on the mark. Â It has a little more of the no-nonsense urban vibe that you want in a Japanese curry place, certainly. Â (It's part of a Japanese chain, so I guess you would hope it's legit.) Â I've been a few times and usually ordered the pork katsu (cutlet) curry. Â  The katsu and the curry is not bad; the flavor has at least some edge (spice) to it and the meat is decent quality. Â But not bad does not equal good. This place just doesn't try all that hard, it seems. Â Their sticky rice, which can and should be amazing, is tepidly so-so. The staff is friendly enough, but the business itself has some weird policies, like not offering chopsticks and being stingy on napkins and such. Â Nothing major, but it comes off as petty. In a fit of frustraton about NY's paucity of Japanese curry options, I tried to make it myself, and the results of that experiment suuuuucked. Â Getting the right balance of flavors for the curry and then the right level of tenderness for the meat is not as easy as you might think. Â  Â  So I have a very healthy respect for places that can pull good Japanese curry off, and promise any restaurant that is remotely close to me that can make a good ""kare raisu"" will get my business. In the end, like any good addict, I go back to Go! Go! Curry to get my Japanese curry fix, and because I just like Japanese curry, and not truly because I like THEIR Japanese curry all that much.

"Imported SOBA Touted as a MUST EAT, I tried their imported-straight-from-Japan-buckwheat-flour hand-made SOBA. It was s'allright. The best part? The restroom. Seriously. The price nowhere matches the quality of the quantity you get. Â A little over-rated.",1
"3.5 stars, My fiancÃ© and I returned to Degustation for our two year anniversary. We were blown away by the 10 course tasting the year before and had been looking forward to this celebratory meal all year! Recently they began taking their reservation on opentable. Unfortunately they only allow for 6:30 or 9:30 time slot. My fiancÃ© called in to see if we can push our opentable reservation back to 7:30. After calling the restaurant twice, they ended up canceling our reservation as a whole and we didnt know until a few days prior when we noticed they didn't call to remind or confirm our time. Nevertheless we were able to make the original 6:30 time and were the second couples to be seated. Upon entering immediately onto the right there's a coat check. Right after seating I noticed that the main chef and the menu have changed since our last visit. Instead of a 5 or 10 course tasting menu, there's only a 7 courses for the same price as the 10 last year. Immediately this place lost a star. 7 courses for 80 bucks isn't that amazing of a deal especially for tapas style restaurant. Back to the food! We were served mushroom croquette as amuse brioche which ended up being my fiancÃ©'s fav. Followed by funion scrambled egg? it was yummy but really overpowered by the funion. The least wow dish of the night was the grilled veggie salad. Blend and oily. Does it really worth a place as one of the 7 dishes? On to the highlights, the dish, pasta and quail with the onion paste were delicious. My fav however was the dessert! Smoked caramelized spanish bread pudding. This dish never fails to amaze my tummy! Service was great but the food really slowed down after the first 3 courses. It took about 2.5 hrs to be served while the couples who came more than half an hr later than us caught up to our courses. After eaten all 7 courses, I was however still starving.. And I'm a 88 pound Asian girl. My fiancÃ© had to eat his leftover lunch to last thru the night. He still vowed to take me back for our annual anniversary but for the price and the amount of food, I'm going to choose another restaurant for its tasting instead. Better change the menu or the chef, or degustation will soon lose its popularity which I suspect already has, looking how it struggled to fill up all the seats on a Friday night compared to last year.",1
"I've had better Malaysian food elsewhere. I'd recommend the Malay Restaurant in flushing if you're looking for tastier food. Here's a list of things my table ordered: Roti canai - just ok Crispy fish cake - really good, taste like stinky tofu with the sauce Fish head soup - not so good Beef rendang - really dry, not as good as expected Hainanese chicken - just ok, ask for the dark meat I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're in the area and craving for Malaysian food.",1
"I finally succumbed and had to come give this place a try. Â I have to admit, I mostly came here not because I wanted to try the dumplings, but because I was in the area and I ran out of my usual frozen dumplings at home. Â I thought, why not, I was two blocks away and needed to restock my freezer with some dumplings so Prosperity Dumplings it was! Â  (I also went to the next street to Vanessa's dumplings and bought a bag of 50 frozen cabbage + pork frozen dumplings too, but that will be a separate review). Â  I bought a bag of 50 chive + pork frozen dumplings for $9 and then $1 fried dumplings. Â I don't know how the frozen dumplings are since I didn't try them yet, but I am hoping they are amazing like the fried dumplings I got to go! Â  The dumplings were freshly made and the skin was so thick and crispy! Â I was expecting something soggy and thin, but these were thick and crispy. Â Sorry I had to say that again, but there are some other dumpling places around the area that have horrible cheaply made dumplings. Â Anyway, I was in for a surprise and I was amazed at how good they were! Â  The soy sauce and hot sauce were watered down of course. Â I guess this is the norm nowadays? Â  This place is a hole in the wall so don't come here and judge the place by its appearance. Â This place is how a typical Asian/Chinese owned hole in the wall place looks like. Â It's something I grew up seeing and used to so don't come here expecting something fancy. Â It's nothing like that. Â The place is small, looks dirty, looks dingy and the service is not top notch. Â Anyway, enough rambling, come here and get yourself some yummy dumplings and you won't be disappointed!",1
"Belgian fries served piping hot along with a large variety of dipping sauces. Â Seriously, I couldn't decide and guys behind the counter were so sweet and helpful. Â I sampled pesto mayo, honey mustard mayo, BBQ, sun dried tomato, curry mayo, pineapple chili, cheese & gravy, chipotle ketchup, I'm sure the people behind me weren't happy. Â At the end of my tasting session, I must of had enough fries to fill the small size. Â That's how generous they were! Â I left with plain ol' ketchup and ranch. Â I like to swirl ranch into my ketchup. Nasty old habit, I can't help it. Â The fries were delish by the way.",1
"I used to come here often before it got much more popular and became hard to get a table. Â I was pleasantly surprised that their food got more sophisticated (pricier, yes) and everything we ordered was good. Â Their sake menu is so big but the wait staff is usually able to answer your questions. Â It was during sakura (cherry blossom) season. Â So they had, just like a good japanese restaurant, a dish to celebrate it. Â It was sakura panna cotta w/ an edible sakura on top and sakura cookies. Â Subtle flavor was so nice and nothing is too sweet. Â If it wasn't hard to book a table, I'd come here more often.",1
"It's a cultural experience for sure. I like the staff. They are either real-live Brazilians or acting very Brazilian very well which is to say they are all beautiful and friendly. Obrigado for the view. But that other side of Brazil has kids with guns carjacking you for sport. $18 for feijoada? This is excessive even for Williamsburg standards. I lived with and made dinner with a bunch of Brazilians for a bunch of years. That price point is highway robbery for black beans and meaty bits. And the portion size of farofa is lacking as well. Still, a good place to hit happy hour and unwind.",1
"I finally checked another spot off of my list. This place serves breakfast all day and since breakfast seems to be my new favorite meal I figured I'd like this. The brick walls have been colored all over in ""crayon"" and it's just a cute atmosphere. -The Griddle Special (eggs, meat, pancakes) +Scrambled Eggs: these are perfectly runny although lack a bit of salt and pepper. +Sourdough Pancakes: these have a serious sourdough, bitter taste and are melty rather than fluffy (yum!). I love them! The syrup and perfectly caramelized bananas really give a nice sweet contrast. +Bubby's Pancakes: Very fluffy and thick. They taste like good 'ole normal pancakes to me. +Chicken Sausage: Â it's very spicy and tangy--in a good way but I think I would have preferred the bacon over sausage. FINAL VERDICT: I loved the atmosphere if the place, the service, the food and the large portions--although it's a bit pricy.",1
"Went here last night for a birthday dinner. This place is super busy. But then we were escorted to the upstairs section which was quaint and private and pretty perfect. On to the food. We got the fried goat cheese(of course), calamari (was amazing), lamb meatballs, the Japanese eggplant (surprisingly good and perfectly cooked), the mussels (average not brilliant), chicken wings( probably shouldn't have got these but it's so hard not to get chicken wings! Miss these not great), skirt steak- this was really good I had trouble sharing this one, and shrimp and chorizo, quite good. All in all the food was really polished, nicely presented, hot, flavorful and decent portions. Only thing I found strange us that they didn't give any bread... Even with the mussels to wipe up the broth! We finally got it after asking for it 3 times. Will probably be back btw the sangria here is epic!!!",1
"Wow.... An amazing find by wifey. Â  We were strolling the village streets as we had a craving for something small and light. Â  We passed by this Tappas place and were blown away by the amazing tastes. Â My wife and I enjoyed the Bacon wrapped Dates, which included goat cheese and a nuts. Â  Our second Tappa was Shrimps with Garlic sauce. Â My taste buds were vibrating once the food was done my body. Â  Make sure to order a Bloody Mary as they made one of the best ones I have ever had!! Â  A++++++",1
"What a lovely spot! I went here for dinner last night with the bff, it is definitely worth trekking from Queens. We were seated timely for our 7:30 reservation, and the dimly lit setting with candlelight at each table definitely made for a cozy atmosphere. We started with the mussels, definitely delicious! So delicious, I forgot to take a picture -_- I ordered the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, while the bff ordered the lamb shank over grits with a side of fries. I loved the chicken and waffles! The waffle tasted as if it had a bite to it..possibly like cornmeal? Not sure. Definitely worth a try! The lamb shank was great, falling off the bone, and the grits made for a perfect combination. The fries were delicious, a tad bit salty for my taste though. We finished off with the pecan pie sundae, super sweet for one person, I'd recommend splitting it! Lastly, the service was wonderful. I love the laid back, yet attentive type of service, so this was spot on. Go here please :)",1
"There's 2 of these spots owned by the same guy and he's super smart/talented with this restaurant shit. Â Don't let the prices fool you...cheap place, but REAL GREAT food and the service is always quick. Â These people know what they're doing...this is a NYC staple. my fave is the eggplant pesto pannini...so good! ~Dave ""Herremannen"" Heilman",1
"I came here for a work event and it was basically open bar with a pizza buffet and dessert. Â I can't comment on dessert because I didn't have any but I can say that the flatbread pizza was addicting. There was a vegetarian mozzarella and tomato pizza, a chicken and bacon pizza, and a sausage with caramelized onion pizza. Â My favorite was the caramelized onion and sausage because the onion added a sweetness that was further enhanced with the meatiness of the sausage. Â The chicken and bacon was also pretty good but that was because instead of regular chicken breast it tasted like it was roasted chicken breast and that made all the difference. The atmosphere in the basement was a little on the industrial side but was tempered by the cozy seating. Note: I saw from the menu that they have a lot more interesting types of pizza there and I would definitely come back to try them. Â I guess they wanted to play it safe for work with the types of pizzas that they ordered.",1
"We picked this place purely based on Yelp reviews and should I say it was the best choice. The seating is very limited so large party is simply out of question. We sat in the only largest table that accomodated 6 people as we were 4. The appatizer prices are $ (Cheap) and the quantaties are tiny in line with the prices, we had the cripy Tofu & the Veg dumplings Â as we had vegetarians in the group, the dumplings were excellent as they had Tofu & peanut filling, the Tofu was average. For the main course we ordered a variety of dishes, the WOK CURRY PASTE with vegatables (substuted the PORK), Chicken pad Thai, Wok cashew nut and shrimp and griller spicy beef salad. My collegues all liked their dishes and ranked them well above average. I had the WOK CURRY PASTE WITh VEGETABLES and order in spicy. On real thai spic level what they served me was Mild ( I can handle a lot more), however the flavour was excellent, I could tase the lemmon grass, and red chilli paste. The other suprise was that the dish had a lot of green chillis which I bit and chewed on and that has no spice ( strange as thai green chilli pepers are super hot). I did have the Longan drink and would suggest its not worth 4$, same with th some of the other drinks, the Thai ice tea looked nice. Their portions are so small, at least the rice quantity needs to be a larger bowl, so they are not really value for money. In my book I would give them a 3+ stars if they can improve quantity they should be a 4.",1
"Pricy and just ok.. I had the steak frites bc of all the hype but It really isnt anything special. Service is good, atmosphere is good as well Â though.",1
"Worth the trek down from Manhattan if you're willing to devote an entire afternoon to the adventure. It's quite a unique experience to watch DeMarco work his magic with the dough. After waiting in line for ~20 minutes we placed our order. Â We went for the square pizza with double pepperoni. The wait from placing our order to actually being served the pizza was a solid, painstaking 2.5 hours. The first bite after the pizza came out of the oven, however, Â made the whole day trip and 2.5 hour wait worth it. The crust was crispy, the cheese could be stretched an arms-length, and the in-house made pepperoni is the best I've ever had. My only reason for docking a star is that (1) they didn't give us double pepperoni and (2) the 2.5 hour wait was a bit excessive. Be cautious of the insane wait if you go for the square pizza, but I think it's 100% worth it.",1
"As good as any other shake shack, but even better if you're around the area for dinner. With most of the working folks gone for the day, there isn't a line to get your burger! Unfortunately, the opposite is true for lunch.",1
"I had been meaning to give Wah Fung #1 a try for some time now & recently finally did so. Â Even at a somewhat off-peak time in the afternoon, they still had a good sized line. Â Which was a bit annoying, because I was hungry. Â But I should have guessed that could have been the case with their neighborhood following and Yelp hype as well. Anyhow, after waiting about half an hour, it was my turn to order the $3.75 small rice w/ cabbage and pork Special. Â One thing that was neat and a bit unexpected, was that they cut up the meats for each order individually as they are being ordered. Â They are not simply scooping up pre-cut meat from a bin. Â So, they are serving the meat fresh and the guy with the big knife is working his tail off ! The food was quite tasty and really hit the spot after having enjoyed a couple beers in the LES right before stopping here. Â Pork was well marinated and cooked just right. Â Cabbage was pretty good and the rice was very basic, but did its job in this dish. Â The portion was a good size especially for the price, but nothing too large. Â Meanwhile, the guy a couple spots ahead of me ordered a container packed with ONLY BBQ PORK ! Wherever, he was going, I`m guessing that he was going to share this bounty with 3-5 other lucky people.",1
"Waited an hr to get in on a Thursday night (6:30pm), and well worth it. Â Ordered the pork buns as the appetizer (best i've ever had) and the ramen with the broth was definitely up there as well. Â  The only thing that I didn't like was the pork they served in the ramen. Â  was a bit on the dry side and should not have been part of the package. Â otherwise, it's definitely a place to hit up. Â *side note. Â this place is also good for parties up to 8.",1
"Two words... KA LAE (Korean way of saying curry). This place Japanese or Korean? I grew up with this type of curry! My first bite took me back to my childhood. I got the single shrimp curry and loved the curry and the spoon it comes with, however I did not like the tarter sauce that came with the shrimp. I actually ended up giving away my shrimp to my friend because of the tarter sauce but I did get to try her chicken which was really delicious. I would give this place 5 stars but the cashier lady was such a mean *beep*!!! I didn't know curry came with a side of attitude? I would come here again for the curry with chicken.",1
not getting what the other yelp reviewers are so happy about with this place. Â it is your standard diner with substandard ambience. Â they had pancakes which were essentially aunt Jemima. Â I wouldn't eat hash browns fried in bacon fat and so essentially the menu was pretty limited/kind of gross. Â won't be going back.,1
"YUM! Looking for something different, I came here for brunch one day. Â I'd never had Filippino food, and didn't know what anything on the menu was. Â Luckily, I was sitting at the bar, and Topher was behind it. Â He answered my questions about every little thing, and gave me suggestions on what I'd like. Â  I ended up ordering the Longsilong Breakfast because it had the term ""sweet, garlicky sausage"" on the menu. Â How could I resist?! Â And the food was just that -- sweet and garlicky. Â My friend had the Tortang Talong, which she enjoyed as well. Â  To drink, I had a Pacquio's Punch (haha!), a couple of the sparking wine drinks, and a Bloody Clara, which I discovered was a Bloody Mary, but with gin. Â I've hated every Bloody Mary I've ever tasted, so I was expecting to hate this one as well. Â But you know what? Â I didn't hate it. Â In fact, I kindof liked it. Â  *second sip* Â Actually, I really liked it! Â The mix is made fresh and is super spicy. Â But in an earthy way, not just in a hot way. Â I liked it so much, I came back to Maharlika after dinner at Ginger two weeks later. Â (Tomato juice after sushi? Â Yeah, it was that good.) Â On that visit, I met Chef Miguel who is a very funny man. Â  I would be remiss to talk about Maharlika without mentioning the atmosphere. Â The ""DJ"" is a laptop opened to Pandora, playing a station started with the song ""Too Close"" by Next. Â Yeah. Â Let's just say that in between shoveling rice in my mouth I was shamelessly singing along to Nelly, K-Ci & JoJo, Usher, and everyone in between. Â AND they have a Mancala board, so I got to show off my skills at that game. I had an amazing first visit, and an equally fun second visit. Â Looking forward to going back again. Â  PS - CASH ONLY!",1
"Solid, reliable pub grub. They make a good burger, can't go wrong with that. The bar is a little on the dark side, if you are into that.",1
"I would give 3.5 stars. I came here with 3 other people to celebrate a birthday. We had made a reservation so there wasn't a worry to finding a seat. The food itself was pretty good, although you order things separately. I would give a higher rating, but the waitress and chef forgot about us. Some of those in my group got food while others did not. When this was finally realized, the chef apparently felt bad and gave us for free the special brussels sprouts appetizer. It was good, but burned. Potentially rushing through it to make up for forgetting about us. I live nearby, so I'd be willing to try again.",1
"My wife wanted cute bistro. I wanted tapas. Jadis proved to be the perfect answer. It's slightly tucked away off the busy LES corridor so even at 8pm on a Saturday we walked right into a table with no wait. The food, though small, was delicious - especially the risotto puffs and spinach/goat cheese crepes. The option to go for a caraffe is always great and while the place was crowded it never felt uncomfortable. When we walked into the back - a lounge with books, couches, and bottles of wine - we knew we hit the sweet spot. Will definitely be back.",1
"A friend in the office told me about this place but when he told me where it was I was like great it is not Â on the way the way home. Â I had to plot when I would be able to work my way over to this place that made my coworker wet his pants when talking about the pizza here. When he first told me it was artichoke pizza I was like huh, what is that all about, then I thought about the artichoke dip at Houstons and thought about how that would taste on some pizza dough, sounds good to me. Post happy hour one night we were hankering for some grub and I mentioned Artichoke, totally out of the way but everyone was down. We cabbed it over and I have to say I was not disappointed and can understand why the guy in the office was salivating over this luscious pizza. I am now a fan, I don't know if I am even willing to try the regular pizza. Â The pizza is so filling I don't think I could ever make it through more than one slice. There is no seating in this place, mostly to go orders or you can stand at one of the consoles to eat, a little tough to get a spot when raining. I know it sounds odd, artichoke pizza but it's worth the experience. Careful, that first bite is HOT!!! if you burn the roof of your mouth because you are so excited to try it ,you ruined your Artichoke experience.",1
"I'll keep it simple: This was the first Mexican meal of many in New York that didn't have me missing and comparing against the amazing Mexican food in Southern California. Guac was buttery and heavenly, chips were thick and able to sustain a sizable amount of said guac and/or salsa. Tacos are Mexico City style; small but packed with strong and simple flavors (though a slight bit too much of the crema sauce). Heuvos Rancheros were some of the best I've had in Mexico, LA, San Diego and Texas. We'll be back.",1
"I admit I'm not a big fan of BBQ. BUT, this place TOTALLY changed my mind! I can say, HANDS DOWN, this is the BEST BBQ place I've ever been to. Just don't go over-board, because when you see the food, your eyes deceives you and you'll think you can eat a lot more than your stomach can handle. Don't make that MISTAKE! A person like me with a fairly large appetite, can eat about 1.25 lbs of food. That's probably 0.75 lbs of meat, 0.25 lbs of whatever sides they have, and 0.25 is probably just bone. I recommend ordering the fattest meats possible. I didn't enjoy the briskets too much, because I thought they were too lean. Go with the ribs, the pork belly, and the sausage! It's much juicier. Sure sure, it's probably not the best for your arteries, but screw it, it's BBQ!",1
"Ridiculous. Love noodles, love this place - not much else to say. I will say I was originally put off because I was thinking they only had knife shaved noodles but they have a variety of noodle types and you can pick the thickness according to your preference and that made this place a noodle heaven! The tofu dish - while simple - is also deeeelish.",1
"I had a good time here but my overall experience was okay. The decor was beautiful and service was excellent. Restaurant is a little bit crammed but that didn't bother me during my visit because I was here for an early lunch. I was here with a friend. Since there were only two people, I asked the waiter if Matador Combo will be too much for two people. He said no. So we ordered it. And it was too much food at the end. We barely finished half of the combo meal. I personally would not recommend to share it with only one other person. The Matador Combo is probably only good with a part of 3+. The chicken was great. Fries were okay. Nothing too special. Yellow rice and beans were also kind of average. The avocado salad was great and perhaps the highlight of my meal. So overall, nothing left me with strong impressions. It was a great dining experience to explore this little gem though!",1
"This is a hidden gem of Chinatown in New York City. The reason i gave this place a four rather than a 5 it deserves is because of three reasons. 1. Price increase 2. Small and dirty looking restaurant 3. Ridiculous long waits. Do not get me wrong, this place is amazing, still inexpensive and a must-go. But I shall justify my reasons. This place used to be famous for the great value they offered everyday. $2 for a small rice with pork and vegetables, delicious and inexpensive. Prices had gradually increased over the years to $3 for a small. Even though the quality is still the same, delicious, I am just utterly disappointed at the pricing. The restaurant is owned by a married couple, and while the man serves the rice and meat, the wife serves delicious rice noodles, fried noodles and tripe at a very inexpensive price that has not changed over the years. Tips: The lines are always constantly long, because the wait is worth the food. Expect to wait on lines for at least 10-15 minutes. Also, although the pace offers inside dining, it is small and one may say a bit unsanitary.",1
"I've only ever had take out here They have a huge selection of empanadas and ive yet to even come close to sampling 1/2 of them. So far my favorites are the spicy chicken and the fig and cheese. I've also had the chocolate banana, and the Brazilian, also tasty. Comes with spicy green and red savory dipping sauces. I love the green sauce. Be prepared to wait atleast 10 minutes for your order and there's no standing space inside so you'll be waiting outside, going in once in a while to check on your order.",1
"Make a reservation beforehand because it does get filled pretty quickly. We were seated right away. I recommend the pig because they order one from Stonybrook Farms weekly, but really any animal is quite good and tastes fresh.",1
"The Maine lobster roll is pretty delicious. Also pretty tiny for $16, but you get a decent amount of lobster. Maybe too expensive and not filling enough to go on the regular, but it's a nice treat when you're feeling rich and not particularly hungry. This place probably deserves 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 because lobster. And the place is pretty cute too.",1
"Crack! The brisket is so damn good. Just put it in your mouth, and talk about foodgasm. The portion is very generous and is topped with a dash of salt. The bbq sauce is on the table and is welcomed on my brisket any day. YUMMM. Tried the Burnt End Baked Beans - HOLY CRAP! I was opposed to it a first but I trusted my friend's awesome judgement and had a bite. It was love at first taste...? =) Also tried the Buttermilk Broccoli Salad which was delish. Fresh and crisp broccoli. My favorite side was the baked beans - which i'm so glad i tried.",1
"I tried coming to this place a few times and got shot down by the wait time. The first time I tried to go, the wait was about 2.5 hrs, the second time I tried, they werent taking any more walk-ins. I guess third time is the charm because I came here on a monday afternoon and the wait was about 30-40 minutes so I decided to stay. The hostess will send you a text when your table is about to be ready so you can go wander around. Between two people we had the.. Chocolate Chip pancakes Southern breakfast Egg benedict Eggs on both dishes was cooked to perfection. Pancakes were moist w/semi melted chocolate chips and oh wow, warm maple syrup is heaven.",1
"When it comes to potatoes, I was Irish in a past life, but truthfully fries are my least favourite potato preparation. Gimme scalloped, au gratin, mashed, baked, twice-baked... well Pommes Frites has added twice-fried to that list. We came here recently after I got madly drunk at the nearby oyster house and demanded fries. Oh boy. Pommes Frites has been on my radar for awhile because they're quite possibly the only place on the East Coast that makes my beloved poutine (cue angels singing) but this time I opted for a regular size with layers of roasted garlic mayo. That's right, they'll layer a sauce (or three) between fries so you have an even amount of shizz on each fry. Honestly, the guy loaded a bit TOO much sauce for my taste, but drunk me wasn't complaining too hard. In hindsight, next time I'll just ask for it on the side -- but the sauces are a must-try, because they're a million times better than the regular ketchup and other condiments you can pick up at the nearby McD's.",1
"When I visit NYC I always arrange plans around one breakfast here. Â I stay at a hotel down in SoHo and then clear the morning to get in line and be one of the first there. Â There is nothing like their blueberry pancakes. So good that Martha Stewart even praises them. Try the banana pancakes too. Â You can't go wrong here. Â Made with love and butter is the slogan. Â I would make sure you get there for a first seating unless you want to wait 45 minutes. Â If so, just take a beeper and go for a walk in the hood. Its a small place so you have to be in the first 20 groups or so to get in the first seating for breakfast. Â  Be sure there will be a line early on the weekends and the last few times I went during the day and it was fine. but you still needed to get there at least 15 minutes before opening.",1
"Pretty good, but I don't know what all the hype is about and why the wait is so long. I went once with some coworkers, and it was just okay. The server asked if I wanted my bahn mi spicy and I said yes, thinking I'd get some spicy sauce. Turns out, ""spicy"" means adding a crapload of hot peppers in them. No bueno.",1
"Juventino isn't that easy to spot. It's a very modern storefront with black lettering on the front. Almost looks like a bookstore and I walked right past it. Once inside, I really liked the atmosphere. There are a lot of books behind the counter, a bright and clean, almost industrial space, and the staff was friendly and attentive. My sister and I were seated outside and it was like eating at a barbecue someone's backyard. I ordered the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was good but seemed like a whole lotta tortilla chips and not enough umph. My sister ordered the pancakes and didn't comment. That's usually not a good thing. Lots of food though - I doubt you will be hungry when you leave. They serve coffee in a French press (nice touch) and the orange juice was fresh. Seemed a bit expensive for breakfast - about fifty bucks for what we had. I would say it's a nice place, but not a restaurant I would travel to. If I lived in the neighborhood AND had a healthy bank account, I would visit again.",1
The Bad - Nothing in particular...ordered to pre fixe lunch The Good - Organic Beefsteak Heirloom Tomato - Chocolate Frivolous - Some chicken entrees - Dessert!!! Many different types of chocolate - Free creme brulee (yummy) The Bottomline- Definitely worth checking out their pre fixe menu. Awesome choices and affordable prices. They have complimentary soup at the beginning and different breads for you to try as they walk around.,1
- it is a well-oiled machine. Everything comes out perfect and on time. We observed the little kitchen on the second floor and that was pretty amazing. - portions are way larger than expected. Way larger. 2-3 times the size of Boqueria portions. - there i,1
"Uber hip place. Casual. And great food. It'll especially be good for people who love savory food, with strong spices, lots of diversity in tastes and flavors.... Although the prices for small plates seem high, still like the mood of the place and how well cooked all their food is. Not saying anything about the authenticity, because this.... was my first time tasting Filipino (westernized? Don't know) food, and as a foreigner, it still tasted 'Filipino'-food like, because of the typical spices and the cute plates",1
"SOOOO GOOOOD! My expectations were not high for the sliders here but I was very impressed!!! When you say ""sliders"" I usually think no more than 2 bites. But the sliders here are actually pretty hefty. I'd say 5 bites or so per slider. This is because the patty is not super thin and it actually has some depth to it. You will be pretty satisfied/full from 2 burgers and an order of fries. DO OPT FOR BACON for a mere 45cents more. The bacon is chopped INTO the meat so you get bacon with every bite and the bacon fat permeates the patty. On top of all of this, you have beautifully grilled onions and melted cheese. And props for the special sauces! As others have said, a mix of the chipotle and jalapeno sauce will add a nice kick :] The wait staff was also very friendly so that's a major plus. Next time, I will have to leave more room in my tummy to try their CANDIED BACON MILKSHAKE!",1
"The food was so delicious, the servers were attentive and quick, and the food came out quickly. The price was also great and place wasn't too crowded. Can't wait to go back.",1
"Came here for brunch with my brother and friend, sat on the outside which had a nice view of 7th avenue. Â In terms fo the decor, the outside seating was your standard lot and The interior was filled with antiquated mexican items and had some interesting skulls and old tequila bottles, it made me think of a Cinco DeMayo Party. For my brunch I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. It took a bit of time to prepare but was quite tasty. The sunnyside up eggs were cooked in well with the tortilla and black beans. It was a tad on the spicy side, despite the waitress saying it really wouldn't be, but I still did enjoy it. For $13 bux Id say its your standard run of the mill Village brunch price. The waitress was friendly enough, and they kept refilling the waters. Next time I am in the mood for a mexican brunch, i know where to go.",1
"Unfortunately, I have not been able to eat at Miriam's. I tried at least twice but the host and staff have been so incredibly rude I had to just walk out. The second time, I was already seated at a table with a friend. The host refused to sit us at another table that was not directly infront of the blowing vent/AC. The table farther away from the cold air was exactly the same, a 2 seater table. There was no reason for him not to move us and we actually asked. He simply said if we didnt like that table then we could leave. Incredibly rude. I always wanted to try this place out but I didnt understand why they would treat patrons this way, all we were looking for was a comfortable way to eat and we were very polite and asked nicely. I just dont think its worth giving your money to company that treats its patron's without respect or consideration.",1
"Simply Delicious! Wanted to try something new for Cinco de Mayo and my friend suggested Bogota Latin Bistro. I'm so happy she did! We shared the Dip Trio appetizer; black bean dip, guacamole and pico de gallo. Best appetizer ever, especially when dining with vegetarians. For my entree, I had the Garlic Rotisserie Chicken with sauteed kale and quinoa pilaf. I truly enjoyed it. On top of the great food, the happy hour special is awesome and the drinks are delicious!",1
"Mason Jars everywhere! The menu isn't extensive, but what they do, they do well. The Sweet Potato waffle was one of a kind, and something more places need to start doing. Or I just need to get a recipe and make one myself! You'll be happy you had the sticky bun, until you realize all the miles you need Â to run to burn off that little sucker",1
"Obviously there are some amazing burger places in NYC so Umami Burger is graded on a curve. They're closer to 4 stars, but due to a couple glitches we've had during visits we'll call it a 3 for now. First off, there may not be a richer burger in NYC than the truffle burger though in fairness I've not yet tried Korzu Haus or Whitman's, both of which apparently have decadent burgers. The recently added (perhaps just on a special) Monte Cristo burger is way off the charts overly rich and filling. The manly burger is outstanding with the firmness of the country bacon offsetting the softness of the medium rare ground chuck. Very good fries, great dipping sauces. Lots of beers available. Really hard to go wrong in general, except when they do. Hoping this place improves with time. Has the chance to be great.",1
"Never actually succeeded in getting brunch here (lines always so long), but we grab dinner here all the time with never a wait. Â For dinner, items are well-priced (entrees under $20) with good sized portions. Dinner favs: mushroom ravioli, grilled shrimp salad, hanger steak, chicken schnitzel",1
"The food was good, but not worth the long trek out to the area. Limited outdoor seating available. The cuban sandwich is yummy and quite large, as was the ropa vieja (very tender, and slightly sweet). They're good about reservations, but the place is kind of loud so it might not be the best place to catch up. My friend actually left her cell phone there, but was able to come back later to pick it up after we called them to check. Honest staff! :)",1
"Over 5K reviews, do you really need anymore? Came here on a Sunday at 10:30am, already about 15people ahead of us. UGH. But the pork belly buns make it so worth it........",1
Great food with a lot of good options. Nice service and good music and atmosphere. good brunch option,1
"Service: Self service for the most part- you order and pay at the register, grab a water if you'd like, take your number to wherever you sit, and the food comes out to you. Food: What we ordered - - Connecticut Lobster Roll with side salad: really good and fresh with large chunks of lobster - Crab Cake Dinner with fries: Crab cakes were large with not much flavor, and had a lot of fillers.. Probably wouldn't order it again. But the fries were really delicious! - Crispy Oysters: great appetizer to start with.. Lightly fried and super fresh. - Shipyard Pumpkin Beer: love that they have seasonal beers! - Random: Sir Kensington's mustard is an amazing condiment!!! Price: in range with every other place that serves lobster rolls",1
"The noodle combos here are fantastic!! I usually get a bowl of udon noodle soup along with a rice dish. I really enjoyed their curry rice. These two items together were only $13.50! What a deal. I could make two, three meals out of it. The udon noodles are silky, but have a nice bite. The soup broth is very tasty, and the portion sizes are humongous. If you get a tempura udon noodle soup, get ready for a gigantic block of fried deliciousnous on the side. I was completely blown away by how much food you get. While Onya nearby does have really good udon, I personally think Udon West is just as good and MUCH nicer on your wallet. The service here is okay. They definitely seem to rush you when you're ordering. I had literally just sat down and only begun to look at my menu when my waiter came over and asked us if we were ready to order (we weren't). The waiters/waitresses are really sweet though, so I think it's just out of habit. However, once your meal comes (that comes quickly too, but that's a good thing), they let you eat in peace.",1
"Came here once on a warm night. Boy it was toasty inside. The panini here was great though. The special was a seafood risotto that I would have loved but considering how warm it was, I had to pass. Definitely intend to go back and enjoy the full menu when the season changes.",1
"So I wasn't really expecting Gramercy Tavern to hold up to the hype that I had heard. And reviews hadn't necessarily been altogether promising, especially when one makes a reservation for 6 to eat an 86 dollar meal. However, I have to say that it was worth it. First of all, they were delightfully accommodating and easy to deal with in a way that even the finest of NYC restaurants often are not. They sat us before our whole party was there, and when the last member couldn't make it, they pleasantly removed his plate and gave us a little more room. What was perhaps most shocking was that we didn't really need more room; in no way are the tables squashed together. It's also a much less loud restaurant than most in NYC, and the atmosphere, with cherry blossoms and candlelight, is lovely. The service was phenomenal, with mirrored servings, but also just generosity with wine tastings, advice, recommendations.... and when two more of our party had to leave prior to dessert, they gave us two extras, with Congratulations (it was my graduation, and someone slid that information to them) written in chocolate syrup. Pretty cute, and mostly just really nice. So on to the food, which did in fact top the service. We each had a variety of items, but all of them were phenomenal. The olive bread is full of whole, juicy olives, to start. And then the first courses were lovely, well-proportioned tastes. I had a lamb peppardelle that was positively phenomenal and intensely flavored. The complexity of the small dish was amazing- it was one of those that reminds a person that good food is one thing, but really amazing food is an entirely other experience. I also tasted the parsnip soup with fiddlehead ferns, which was just as delicious, and the asparagus soup with crispy oysters. Just the layering of textures and flavors in each of these dishes showed the mastery. The wine pairings, as suggested by a connoisseur friend (pretentious as that sounds) and our main server, were perfect... and also reminded me that occasionally something beyond my delightful $3 Trader Joe's wine might be a good idea. And that there actually is a difference, even if it's a difference I can afford very rarely. Then the mains. I had the soft-shell crab special, which was perfectly nouveau Americana and made me very, very happy. Again, the portions were perfect, and each different dish was treated well according to what it demanded. A friend's sirloin was served medium rare, and held a perfect heft and juiciness. A risotto was the only slight disappointment, as it was just slightly tougher than it should have been, but the flavors were lovely. The halibut was creamily delicious. The dessert options had a wonderful range, which we were able to experience quite fully. The chocolate zucchini cake with thyme walnut ice cream was great- rich but not overly so and still had some zucchini flavor. The tapioca with mango etc was perhaps my favorite, with large tapioca and a phenomenally light, airy flavor. The chocolate mousse, one of our extras, was excellent and very rich, but not heavy. The rhubard cake with strawberry rhubard ice cream showed their range, as it was considerably lighter, with a well balanced tartness of the rhubarb and sweetness of the strawberry. The chocolate tartlets were also excellent, although perhaps slightly less memorable than the other options. Of course, these are then followed by petit-fours, which were lovely but hard to fit in the belly after all the earlier goodness. And then they give you a muffin for in the morning... so you don't forget. I'll admit I froze my muffin. The meal was just too good, and I have to save the memory for later. It was honestly one of the finest meals I've ever had. I was absolutely thrilled with the overall experience. It's definitely not somewhere I'll be able to go to regularly, but it's definitely worth it for a special occasion kind of meal.",1
"Like most New Yorkers, I firmly believe in the most important weekend meal: brunch. One of my favorite things to do on a weekend, is to brunch in Tribeca and there are more than a handful of quaint, homey little places to enjoy this beloved NYC meal in the area. I have tried a lot of places around here, but have never gone to The Odeon. You can't miss it, it has these beautiful big red letters lighting up the marquee on the corner of Thomas St. This past weekend, I made a quick reservation and my big brother and I set out to give this place a try! When we walked in, I was super amused by the art deco styled French bistro setting. It's very retro in a cute and quaint way and I absolutely loved it! It really reminded me of some of the places I frequented when I lived in Paris. When Rich and I walked in, we also got these super antiquey tickets with ""THE ODEON"" and the address printed on it. The menu is pretty standard for brunch, as you can choose from breakfast favorites such as Eggs Benedict (which is what I had), steak and eggs, custom omelettes and pancakes... just to name a few. They also have a nice menu of brunch cocktails, some of which that are seasonal; Rich had the Sriracha Bloody Mary. The food and service were delightful. The seats were comfy and it was a really enjoyable brunch where we didn't have to beat down hoard of drunkees for a delightful brunch. The noise level was perfect, you could tell there were other tables near by, but could sit comfortably and enjoy your own conversations. I cleaned my plate and was very satisfied after our meal. I can't wait to come back for another delicious laid back brunch!",1
"As someone who eats ""Japanese"" food regularly, it was humbling to walk into Ootoya and realise I didn't have the first clue what to order. My friend, who had been to Japan the past year, had been craving authentic, food-of-the-people Japanese. We were not disappointed. The decor is beautiful, and the staff immediately brought out hot towels when we were seated. After puzzling over the menu, I asked for a recommendation and ordered the tonkatsu (pork) special. My friend ordered the saba (grilled salted mackerel) set. Added on some yakotori - liver and asparagus wrapped in pork belly - and some homemade tofu for appetisers, and we had more food than we could finish. Ootoya seems to be better at cooking fish than red meat, as both the pork belly and the tonkatsu were drier than I would have liked them, but the fish was delightfully flaky. The sauce for everything was well seasoned, and the egg custard that came with the dinner sets was delightfully light. We closed out the meal with a dessert crepe, which was light and all our full bellies could handle. In a city where there's a sushi restaurant on every corner, ramen lines out the door, and endless yakitori shops, Ootoya is a quiet oasis of homey Japanese cuisine that provides a welcome diversity.",1
"I've been to many ippudo in other places and the New York one just has the same high standards.Though I don't really like pork,here tastes good.And I tried the deserts recommended by many people:matcha brÃ»lÃ©e and Mille crepe,they won't let you down.",1
Great drinks. Lawnmower is excellent. Gets very crowded.,1
"An impromptu dinner with family brought me back to this Times Square institution at least a decade after my previous visit. Â The hostess isn't all that accommodating. Â We were a party of 10, my uncle arrived at 3pm and let them know we would be 10 people if they could put us down for a table. Â He was told no because everyone had not arrived. Â At about 10 to 4 the hostess came over and said OK we are setting up your table, but you need to be done by 5:30 because it is reserved. Â After a talk with my uncle, they agreed to seat us upstairs. Which worked out great, if they could be a bit more accommodating without upsetting people that'd be great. Â So if you are nice and calm, you can probably work something out. If you don't know, everything is served family style and the portions are huge. Â They serve the best Caesar salad I've ever had and the fried calamari is tender and flavorful. Â We opted for the pasta special witch included 4 types of pasta on one plate. Â The fusilli bolognese and the ravioli alfredo were the best of the bunch. Â The chicken parmigiana was fried well and juicy without being greasy. Â The shrimp scampi was garlicky and delicious. Â The sauce was very reminiscent of baked clams and screamed for it to be sopped up with a piece of bread. Â  If you love dessert go for the titanic! Â It is the most fudgy brownie you've ever had topped with ice cream, whipped cream and nuts and it is completely decadent and divine. This is a great place to go to with a group, the atmosphere is energetic and fun. Â The servers are great and friendly. Â It's also pretty affordable, the bill came out to $39/person and that included wine and tip and we all left happy and full. This is a red sauce type of joint, I wouldn't call it authentic Italian, but they serve up a good meal and an enjoyable experience.",1
"$25 for a bowl of ramen? YES! It's cheaper than a plane ticket to Japan for this good stuff! Came at an odd hour for lunch (around 3 or 4pm on a Sunday) and got seated right away, but either way it would be worth the average wait time that this place is infamous for. First off the decor is impeccably done. High energy atmosphere paired with communal type tables just perfects the experience. We sat anonymously across from an elderly lady and her friend, while others were scattered among the long tables with strangers, or squeezed in big U-Shaped booths with close friends, love it. We started with the pork buns. Which is basically the worlds most incredible steamed bun stuffed with some god-like pork and sauce. Seriously, I have never seen anything this soft and succulent since the Marriott bed at a resort in Maui. If I could date this pork bun I would. If I could take this pork bun home to meet momma I would. Pork bun I love you. I ordered the Akamaru Modern with all the suggested toppings and it was to die for. So many flavors and textures, and the meat was so well braised it melted in my mouth. The eggs were perfectly cooked, with enough yolk to keep it interesting, and the broth was incredible. A++ in my book so far!",1
"Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) Trumps ANY ramen place in NY in my opinion...screw Ippudo...this place sticks truer to the authentic Japanese style and yet plays with innovative flava flavs like spicy kimchi miso ramen 2) Not greasy 3) Very generous with the noodles (not like other places that are stingy and charge you more for refills...cough Ippudo and Totto) 4) Will not have to wait 1-2 hours for a seat...had a party of 6 and easily sat within 15 min on a Friday night 7:00 PM 5) Very nice staff, always refilling your glass of water 6) Quaint and practical area with limited seating...but it works Cons: 1) Don't go for the appetizers, go for their DELISH ramen bowls 2) Their plum sake/wine was waaaaay too sweet for me",1
"I am really on the fence about how many stars to give this place. I took my girlfriend here last night for her birthday. I had been here a few years ago and really enjoyed it so I figured it would be a perfect place for her birthday. We got there early as it is REALLY small. We sat at a nice table outside with a really nice view of the block. For appetizers we had, Warm artichoke gratin and the broiled escargot. They were excellent, perfectly cooked. After the great appetizers we were really excited for our meals. I ordered the mussels and my girlfriend ordered the Bouchee a la Reine. The first bite my girlfriend took she bit down on an eggshell, cutting the roof of her mouth. The waitress came over and said she would take it back however her response was ""things happen"". I thought that was pretty rude...no egg shells don't just happen. It wasn't even a small piece it was bigger than my thumbnail. My girlfriend then ordered Beef Mignonette. It took about 25 minutes for her new order. My meal became cold waiting for her new order. Her beef was very tasty. Only problem she ordered medium and it came out medium rare. The food was very good, however I am a little upset they did not take ANYTHING off our bill or even offer a free dessert. I was really surprised at how they handled this. We should have gotten some type of compensation for a eggshell in our food. The one really good thing about this place is that its BYOB. I would get there early if you plan on eating there for dinner since it is VERY small and gets crowded really quickly. Remember CASH ONLY!",1
"Spicy Village is one of those small places you might pass by many times, then decide to wander in and bemoan all those years of passing it by. What a gem this lovely place is, known for their large, flat, hand pulled noodles. I was more used to the knife cut and thin spaghetti style so I was pleasantly surprised to find this place made them broad. Unlike many old style pulled noodle places, this one has vegetarian options like a standout Tomato and Egg over noodle combo that brings back such warm fuzzies of a family fave, tomato and egg over rice. Unlike mom and dad's, this one had a tad more sesame oil and less garlic, and was served with crunchy, perfectly cooked baby bok choy.. Delicious all the same. I also tried one day with sis the vegetable dumplings, doughy pockets filled with the standard chopped veggies. Tasty but I'd stick to the noodles. The spicy vegetable combo over the noodle had cumin, not my fave spice but a specialty of this region,, but it was good. I guess that most of the meat dishes are spiced with cumin. Most of the meat dishes are beef or lamb in varyng forms. Noodles come in soup or dry, with toppings over the soupless noodles. Prices are gentle on the wallet, nothing over $6. This restaurant is a humble place, clean with only a few table covered with contact paper(a blast from the past). The bathroom, unlike in many Chinatown dives, is clean. The owners care about this place. Service is more self serve once you place your order. You get your own drinks from the fridge and chopsticks and such are on the table. But the warm, geniuine cheer of the owner(?) waitress behooves us always to tip her. I've been here twice already, bringing friends and family, to spread the word that bellies can be filled her with good food and good vibes. I introduced my sis, and I think she's been here three times in two weeks. That Rich W sure has a stomach for finding some of the best eats.",1
"Have been living in the area for nearly a year, and always told myself to check it out when I walked past. I am glad I finally did. It's a great spot, cozy, classy and at a walking distance! Great cocktails, lovely staff, what's not to like?",1
"Nice casual ambiance. Slightly loud. Friendly service. Nice beer and drink selection. Reasonable prices. Mussel appetizer was good. Had the steak tip stew with fries and enjoyed it, flavorful well braised. Friend had a steak and liked it. Tried the house beer was pretty good. I'd come here again.",1
Dope but the new owners are def less passionate about the pizza making process and you can taste the difference! But I will still keep coming here for years to come unless there will be another drastic change for the worse! Best squares in nyc,1
"I've had their combination lunch box (sashimi, donkatsu, udon, and some other yummy things) as well as the curry Donkatsu and the lunch special of Curry Udon (comes with a variety of tempura, potato salad, rice, and pumpkin pieces). Food was delicious! Â Although the curry donkatsu was a little deceiving in portions because the sauce and rice took up SO much of the place and you don't realize that there really isn't a ton of meat there until you sift through the sauce. Â Decent amount though, and I guess the rice fills you up! Â  My lunch combo was perfection. Â It was everything I wanted and expected in Â ""combo"" and the portions were just right! Â I took a chance with the curry udon and boy, am I glad I did! Â The sauce had just the right consistency between soup and sauce and I had a lot of leftover sauce that I was able to put on my rice and enjoy! Â The donkatsu is super juicy on the inside, crispy on the inside, and the SAUCE is amazing. I'm not sure if it is owned by the same people, but their service, as well as the ambience at the 55nd street location is much better in my opinion. Definitely a great place to come for lunch or dinner with friends, clients, coworkers, whoever!",1
"For months, I had to deal with seeing reviews from Yelpers on my friends' activity feed on how great this place is. Â When I finally made the trek to NYC, I had to drag my sister here for a late night snack. Â  This place is tiny so if you're one who cannot tolerate small places (like my sis) order to go. Â While I was waiting for my order of poutine, I was served samples of their sauces with a few frites. Â The frites by themselves are so delicious: perfectly crisp and seasoned. Â The sauces I sampled (roasted garlic mayo, curry ketchup, and pesto mayo) were delicious as well. I couldn't say the same for their poutine though. Â I thought it was interesting they used chicken gravy and that was ok. Â The cheese curds could have been melted better and that was a pain to try to eat that with the frites so don't forget to grab a fork. Â If anything, just stick to the frites and sauces.",1
"Great food! Great value! Perfect for a QUICK bite before a movie, etc. I was a little skeptical at first because I DO NOT do buffets, but this one was very clean, fresh and not the kind of deal where people can go back for more. In fact, I would call it a food bar rather than a buffet. If you like Brazilian food, this place is a MUST.",1
"Very authentic and wide range of Malaysian dishes. Service was quick and not pricey. Limited number of tables though, go early.",1
awesome foodssss! bf and i had a wonderful time using the groupon deal and it is so worth it! I will visit again!,1
"Now this is what I'm talking about in terms of BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. There's nothing like going out to the meatpacking with all the trendy and skinny people, and stopping by corner bistro at 2am for a juicy burger (they're open til 4). Dont try to be diety - get the HOUSE BURGER with BACON, FRIES and a BEER. Cheers!!!",1
"Hands down the BEST place for Greek seafood and more (and I'm Greek)! I love this place and I am always comparing it to other spots we try and nothing compares. The wait is the only issue here - it is usually about 2 hrs on a weekend so be prepared to leave your name with the hostess and go have pre-dinner drinks somewhere else while you wait. Trust me, the wait is well worth it!!! I usually order fish and lemon potatoes & dandelions - everything is extra fresh & amazing, and the grilled octopus, saganaki and the peasant salad are a must for starters. And they also give you free dessert. ENJOY!!!",1
"Probably the best $3.50 I've spent on food in this country. The noodles, a big plate of them with peanut butter and soy sauce on the bottom = $2. A split large order of boiled pork and chive dumplings = $1.50. My jaw almost hit the floor when she said, 'okay, $7' which was the total for two people to eat here. Other pluses are that there ARE places to sit and they're easy to come by, and that the cashiers english is good enough so that your order isn't screwed up. I would NEVER have walked into this place if it wasn't for Yelp- thank you for yet again another great find. I will absolutely be back here.",1
Ok - not to be a downer here but I do not get why this place has good reviews. Place has busted tile and ripped leather seats. Happy hour is not that happy. Plus the drinks are icky,1
"The food here is good although I didn't think that it was worth the price. The portion size is sad for what you pay. I got the sausages and the brisket. The sausages were a little bit spicy and the brisket had some juicy parts but they were okay overall. My friend got the pulled pork sandwich which was pretty good. The mashed sweet potato and the iced tea were probably the best parts of my meal there though. The line was long by the time I got there in the afternoon and I ended up waiting a while before I could order the food. The seatings there were okay as well although they also have tables outside. Overall, I think the place is worth a try if you really want some bbq but I wouldn't consider it as a must-try place.",1
"Oh man, if this is the only food I had to eat for the rest of my life then I would. I will come back again and again and again for this. Don't complain about the wait. Your food is worth it. If you're upset about it, go to dominos.",1
"I h ad an awesome experience at Frankie's 457! The outdoor dining area felt more like a small European town than NYC, which I guess is more of the vibe in Caroll Gardens. The staff was SO welcoming to our birthday group. They were very accommodating about taking the cupcakes we had with us and putting them in the refrigerator while we ate. I ordered the cavatelli and they were delicious. I would highly recommend getting it but all of the homemade pasta dishes are also to die for. We also had a watermelon salad from the specials menu that was great. Great neighborhood spot.",1
"Local neighborhood family Brazilian restaurant that is definitely worth a trip into Astoria except for one rather upsetting flaw. Let's start with what is right. The tattooed and pierced body waiter is friendly and professional. Â  The Acaraje, which is grilled shrimp (perfectly seasoned and grilled) on top of a patty was really good. But the Bolinho de Bacalhau was fantastic. Very tasty. Here's why this place could have been 5 stars: The picanha top sirloin steak was bland and tasteless. Â No seasoning or marinade, Â WTF? Â Maybe we should have ordered the daily special or the other steak on the menu. Â Disappointed after a a great start to dinner.",1
"Woorijip is a solid way to try out korean staples but has started a downward spiral in an effort to keep up with the rising costs of NYC. I was first introduced to this place about a year ago. To find a cheap place for lunch that delivers in quality around this area is TOUGH, and Woorijip did it. I have been pretty much going every week since I was introduced, and have seen the options dwindle. They have a pretty awesome lunch buffet that will cost you about 10 bucks. I will usually go for the pre-made lunches, the (not really)spicy pork being my favorite. My absolute favorite was this squid dish they had once, but I have only seen it once. Regardless of the bad changes, I still really like the place and think its one of the better lunch options in Midtown.",1
"To the newbies: trust the hundreds of reviews and get the spinach gorgonzola gnocchi! They are light as a feather and the sauce is perfected (not too creamy/ rich as one may fear). Other good menu items are the mussels and grilled calamari. Skip the bruschetta. Cheap carafe prices ($16-$18), and the place is CASH ONLY. I've dined both indoors and outdoors; both were memorable experiences because of the food and company. Service is eh, but when you're paying twenty bucks for a home cooked italian meal, I'll let it go. As long as they have the gnocchi on the menu, Malatesta will own my soul forever.",1
Best damn pizza. Â Worth the wait.,1
"Crazy busy, tight inside, shared table seating, but that does mean you get seated reasonably quickly despite the crowds. Green beans are a little too much dried beef-- not delicate in taste as a result. Not bad though, but disappointing. Xiao long bao in pork form are pretty decent, the pork and crab are even better, but the end product is just average. They lack the delicacy or the presentation of the better places I've had, and while the taste was pretty acceptable, the taste again lacked the explosive bursts of flavor on your taste buds of the best places.",1
"Don't believe everything you read on the internet, my husband leans over and whispers to me. Â  Why is it impossible to get a reservation here? Â  Why are there so many good reviews? Did our anniversary just happen to fall on on off night? This is not good food people. Â  The duck appetizer was absolutely amazing. Â Complex, complementing flavors, and perfectly cooked duck. Â Other than that, nothing was noteworthy or even good. Â The onion soup was average. Â THE pork chop was awful. Â My husband knows pork. Â He fell off his chair when he ate the one at Hearth. Â THE pork chop at Little Owl was overcooked, dry, tasteless, and not good quality meat. Â He said it tasted like it had been frozen and defrosted. Â I read a raving Yelp review about the Filet Mignon stroganoff being the best stroganoff in the world. Â Not by far. Â The meat was overcooked, tasteless, dry. Â The noodles ok. Â The famous sliders - ""the best in the city!"". Â Flavorless. Â Yes, tender. Â Yes, cute as a button. Â Absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Â Not the best sliders I have had by far. Â I am PERPLEXED. Â  The best part was that the restaurant is lovely. Â Very romantic. Â I loved the floor to ceiling windows. Â Loved the wood panel walls. Â Loved the tin roof. Â Service was great. Â Couldn't figure out why there was absolutely nothing to dry your hands with in the loo...but hey - I guess tp will do. Â  But forget that. Â We came for the food. Â We spent $174 for 2 and left perplexed, disappointed, and yes, a little angry.",1
"This place is a hidden gem. Nestled in an apartment building, decorated with potted flowers, it was difficult to find at first. Inside has a completely different feel with its dimly candle-lit wooden interior. It is surprisingly spacious and has a second floor. I somehow felt transported into a rustic cottage or medieval hall. The food does not disappoint. Maybe only the size of the lamb meatballs, but everything we ordered was delicious. Come here with a group for tapas. Or come with a group of 10 for the Whole Shebang (one of each item on the menu).",1
"Pros - (price, size, quality) - Their bahn mi is absolutely delicious. We always order the number 1 or 4, number 1 being the bbq crispy pork and number 4 being the pate. The crispy pork is a bit on tough to chew side but it's really flavorful. The pate is also really good but it's not as flavorful as their #1. The sandwiches are dirt cheap for the amount of food and flavor in them. Cons - (placement of restaurant, no place to sit and eat) One of the committee has been a loyal customer ever since they were in a shack under the bridge, and has abstained from giving too much of a ""con"" for the restaurant. In the old shack days, you used to have to reserve your sandwich in advance because they sold out so quickly but ever since they moved to their new location that's not really a worry, although we do suggest you call in advance if you have a large order. It is important to mention though that the place is more like a fast food take out only restaurant than anything else, with a jewelry store right inside restaurant. You're best off ordering the food and eating elsewhere. Â  Â  Comparable to: Paris Baguette",1
"Sizzling SigSig earned this restaurant its 3 stars. It is AMAZING. I don't eat much Filipino food, but this is the best I've had in the city so far. I ate with 4 other people family style and it worked out very very well. On top of the sigsig, pork belly adobo, mussels, baby back ribs, and the halo halo for dessert. For the most part, the food was very basic; it tasted a lot like traditional chinese food (mostly the pork belly & skin) and I wasn't very impressed with it. The space is also huge, but gives off a weird vibe because of the $15/all you can drink beer. Saw a lot of drunk people wandering around mixed with a few dates and white collar business-man.",1
"This is my favorite place in all of Greenpoint/Williamsburg. The food is absolutely excellent as is the service (a rare find for Williamsburg!). I loved the food so much I came for dinner and came back again the next day for brunch. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, but I can say that the Chicken is outstanding as is the burger (possibly the best burger in the area). They also offer a fabulous whipped ricotta with bread at both dinner and brunch (slightly different offerings based on brunch vs dinner). Â I hope they bring back the egg and roasted vegetable sandwich to the brunch menu, it was CRAZY amazing. A++++++++++++",1
"If there's one thing about hipsters, they know good food. Â This place is it. Â It's on a great corner with some outdoor benches while you wait. Â My party had been there a little while so we were given some coffee. Â When we put our name down I didn't get a good look inside and was a littler irritated with how long we had to wait, but it was Sunday and afternoon. Â Finally when ushered to our table we realized just how tiny Cornerstone is and immediately were happy we found it and knew the food would be good. Â I had a breakfast sandwich that tasted so fresh I swear I was transported to a farm in Maine eating at a big wooden kichen table listening to the chicken clucking outside and looking at the vegetable garden out the window that all went into making my sandwich. Â  The crepe my friend had was pretty standard. Overall nice prices, truely excellent clean fresh food. Â Nice waitstaff. Â Cool location. Â Great for hipster watching.",1
"An easy and predictable (and affordable!) brunch place that you can always count on. Â I love it cause it's in the neighborhood, but not sure if I would go out of my way to try it. This past Saturday, I decided to put my party of 5 down at around 11am down. They quoted me for a 1hr wait, and put us down on the BuzzTable app that they would use to text me when our table was ready. Got buzzed within 35 minutes (d'oh! not all my friends were there yet since I told them it would be an hour). We all got there and we were told we would be the next to be seated. Ended finally getting a table at 1pm (far from the 1 hr wait we were initially quoted). Some people need to be table hogs in a small brunch place, when CLEARLY tons of people are waiting for their table. Anyway, onwards to the food. For $15, you can get a brunch dish and a mimosa or peach bellini (or juice or coffee). We ended up ordering the boozy options - it was light in champagne, heavy in juice, but good enough to be happy and celebratory for a nice day. Get the penny egg sandwich, definitely one of my faves!",1
"I have to admit some shame in passing some undeserved judgement on Do or Dine, even before approaching the restaurant -- crazy menu, crazy reviews, delivering an overall message that was so eccentric I didn't know if I could handle it. However, the experience was beyond amazing and then some. Â I went while they still had the lovely patio in the back, so it was a nice chill summer evening sharing one end of the long bench table with a nice, unrowdy crowd of folks at the other end. Â Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of my cocktail other than it was lemony and garnished with a cucumber, which I normally despise but was a great accent to the vodka. Â Or gin. Â Or... damn, it must've hit me hard if I can't remember. What I do remember about eating here is the coffee-rubbed steak, which was seared perfectly, accompanied with delicious potatoes and avocado bits. Â What I also remember is wanting my companion's duck breast, which tasted ten times more divine than mine. Â And what stands out in my mind is the unforgettable trio of gelato desserts, one which was a dizzying yet amazing combo of hazelnut-miso. Not that I can remember much of that night -- it was a bit hazy, thanks to that lemony cocktail, so obviously I have to return back to Do or Dine to get my memories sorted properly.",1
"this is a pork lovers paradise! great authentic bbq. and beer is served by the gallon! my only problem is the fact that there aren't any great side dishes. but then again thats not what this place is about...so if your in the mood for some good ol' bbq....come on down! side note....it can get quite crowded here, so come prepared to have to wait.",1
"Nothing makes me happier than going back to a place I rated poorly and clearly being able to see improvements. I was invited back to Hometown by the affable manager and I'm so glad I returned as everything has improved...with the exception of the potato salad - that was just as good as I remembered it. Had lamb belly for the first time and I'm glad, well seasoned, tender and cooked to perfection. The brisket was much more moist, but not overly fatty, and tasted less salty this time around. My best friend really enjoyed his beef ribs which were tender, almost falling off the bone and I recalled they were a little tough the first time I tried them. The real winners for me - and there were no losers - were the brisket and collard greens with bacon (amazingly good). Also, didn't appreciate the impressive decor and space the first time around. Really love the wood, the open feel, and the communal tables. Lastly, the service both at our table and from the guys at the carving area was impeccable (thanks Michael!). I'm really looking forward to going back and especially after feeling so welcomed.",1
"Been here for 3 or so parties over the years. A great spot to gather with a group for some wine and apps. Â I think I'd prefer to have a late hardy lunch and come here later on in the evening for drinks and some apps...you know, like tapas.",1
"The pork buns are the best I've ever had, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about my experience here. Service was awkward and jumbled (we sat at the bar), so much so, that one server literally gave away our food to diners who had sat down 5 minutes earlier (they ordered the same two dishes) leaving us waiting more than a half hour between courses...no apology, no update, no ""making it right', no nothing. The food outside of the porkbuns, heirloom tomato uni and seasonal cerviche was barely edible: The alkaline tagliatelle was awful - and mind you, I like ""fishy flavors"" - this dish was extremely salty and really amateurish for a restaurant with such a rich heritage. The noodles were way over cooked and sauce tasting like it came from a ""SALE: EXPIRING SOON"" section at Food Emporium. The roasted maitake dish was inedible. I love liver mousse and was really looking forward to this dish. This dish was composed of scorched (read burnt) vegetables, splattered liver mousse and what resembled, and tasted like, bacon bits out of a plastic container. We literally had two bites before completely giving up. Our server picked up the full, uneaten, dish and asked ""great right"" - yeah bro, it was so great we wanted to save some for the kitchen.... One could eat the spicy pork sausage & rice cakes all day long and never tire, however, as mentioned above, we had to wait 30+ minutes for this dish after eating other courses, leaving us full and unable to enjoy. Disappointed, especially at these prices.",1
"My favorite restaurant in NYC. Â The food is so fantastic - I've tried numerous dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed. Â The atmosphere is a little loud but if you're seated downstairs, it's not much of an issue. Â There's live music, a cigar roller, and they put sugar cane in your mojito :)",1
"I finally got a taste of what many people were raving about and find myself slightly disappointed with their balls. I ordered the regular beef meatballs with tomato sauce, which came with a nice portion of arugula salad. The meatballs itself were not as soft as I was expecting it to be and it appeared some of it were overcooked. We came on a Saturday morning so the place was packed but it didn't take long to get us seated at a communal table. It's a small and tight place but feels kind of cozy especially on a winter day. The vintage dÃ©cor definitely gives it a cozy ambiance. Overall, it's not a bad place but I wouldn't expect too much out of it.",1
"really great service, really great salad, meh-to-bad entrees",1
"I hate insipid brunches. Everywhere serves the same scrambled eggs that I can make myself. The Farm is smart enough to create an interesting brunch menu that actually makes me want to get out of bed before noon. Â The only thing I don't like is the long line, but the waitresses are nice enough to get your drink order while you wait. The poached egg, herring, and greens - delicious. The corned beef hash with beets - amazing. Best brunch in NYC IMO.",1
"I love their steamed vegetable dumplings so much that I am willing to take my whole lunch break to walk there, order, get food and walk back. Then I have to eat at my desk. I don't even care. I love that you can see them prepping the food behind the counter. And, if there is ever time, the place actually has space for tables/chairs so it feels a bit more comfortable than a food truck. I think the Chinatown location is significantly better than the Brooklyn location but it could be just in my head. If you haven't been, definitely try it out. The soups look good too but I've never tried them.",1
"This is an oasis in the desert, especially after hours of walking in the warehouse neighborhood of east Williamsburg. I had a urge to order everything on the menu while I came Â in. Unfortunately it's a cash only restaurant and no ATM around. So my ambition just fell into the reality. Decor-2/5 The bad news is - there is no public bathroom. The closest one is in mickey Ds 10 mins walking from the restaurant. (And there is no good news.) Service-3/5 The bad news is-no servers in this restaurant. And the good news is I was capable of carrying my tray with a stack of food. Food-4/5 I ordered Spinach dumplings, pork noodles and two cups of ice plum juice. The price of this location is about 20% more than east village and midtown west. Sitting outdoor with cute vintage Chinese furniture. I feel I had fulfilled my dream of being a hipster. Jumbo size of dumplings. "" al dente"" noodles with delicious spicy savory sauce. I will bring more cash next time !!!!",1
"I've been planning to visit this restaurant in a month and I finally when there with my husband a always! I craved some asian food in midnight and ""of course"" start checking Yelp with my computer and found my crave point in this restaurant. somehow, I already knew about around Elmhurst is the hot asian cuisine area in long time cuz I've been live in Woodside, Sunnyside in 15years and Elmhurst is also my everyday grocery shopping area and go there pretty often. Only my problem was I couldn't and hard to change my mind ones I got a favorite restaurant and I never thought to trying another place... anyway, my husband and I when there after the long Sunday work. We had 5 dishes total! 1, Sizzling Bean Curd 2, Kangkung Belacan (vegetable dish) 3, Malaysian Satay (beef) 4, Nasi Goreng (rice dish) 5, Crispy Seafood Egg Noodle I know that was too much order...but! we almost finished everything. all reasonable, good portion and taste sooooo good! seats are bit tiny so not good for big group if there are crowded but you still can go there with your friends cuz there has a 2 bigger table seats for about up to 5 people so as far as that table is available. and customers are in and out so quick and smooth so you won't wait long I'm sure. I may suggest just call them and ask before you arrived to make sure the table seats is available or not. also all the service is very very good, all the workers were so nice. We are already making a plan to go there again in very very soon!",1
"Dinner for two that was great for $30. Granted, my wife got soup and is a light eater. But the place was a great value. We got the mixed fries appetizer at the beginning which was good. I got the pork chop which was absolutely great. Highly recommend!",1
"We had our wedding reception in the large private room downstairs in June 2013. Everything was great -- food, service, atmosphere. Just what we wanted. We had about 35 guests. I worked with the events team at The Smith's corporate office to do all the preparation/planning/menu selection and so on. The team there was very competent and focused. I can be 'particular' about certain things, but the event planners were patient with me, and were clear about what was negotiable and what wasn't. The manager on site, Josh, was terrific. He showed me the space several times, and even recognized my fiancee when she showed up for brunch with her mom a few weeks before the wedding. The night of the reception, Josh was there and everything went exactly according to plan. The food -- from the hors d'oeuvres to the entrees and dessert was delicious. Guests were praising it months later. My one quibble was that after Josh left late in the evening, the bartender disappeared for a while and I had to go chase someone down to staff the bar. But, that was a brief issue in a long and complex event and the team at the Smith did a great job from start to finish. If I had to do it all over, I would host my reception at The Smith again, and would recommend it to anyone planning a mid-size to large event.",1
"With so many great Thai places to eat in LA, absolutely LOVED Room Service in NYC. Ordered a bunch of dishes, and the food was absolutely incredible. Between 4 of us, we killed about 6 dishes, and cleaned our plates clean. Drunken noodles, Shrimp fried rice, spicy basil eggplant with beef (requested and made to perfection), Panang curry with shrimp, Tom yum soup with shrimp and a couple of other things that my memory isn't serving me for at the moment. Â  We ordered family style, but the portions aren't really meant to be eaten family style, if that makes sense. This was a totally trendy and extremely well decorated restaurant, the massive chandelier on table level basically had me wanting to hug it and bring it home with me. A little tight on space, but I wasn't expecting to recline in my chair and throw my legs up and eat anyway. I want to give this place 5 stars for the food and atmosphere and it's taking me everything not to give 3 stars, but the food was just that good that I will settle on 4 because the service is just terrible. You guys would easily have 5 stars if you just had some servers who actually cared about the reputation of a restaurant. I'm not going to bring language barrier as an issue, but just having a decently police server can go a long way. Also, FLAT soda. Nothing ruins a meal more than a glass of syrup, was definitely disappointed with that. Please get this fixed. But great food nonetheless.",1
"Tapas is a perennial favorite and, for people who enjoy dabbling in a multitude of dishes, it remans a cost-effective means by which to tantalize the taste buds in earnest, all at a reasonable price. And, at an establishment like The Saint Austere, all one wants to do is dabble in more dishes than one could possibly hope to enjoy without exceeding the maximum stretch capacity of your jeans. In short: It is our kind of place. We hopped over at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening and were welcomed by the friendly manager into a comfortable space that was not at all crowded since, apparently, the masses arrive between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Though the menu may not be as extensive as an institution like Traif, the same principle applies: the portion sizes vary (all explained by the staff) and there are dishes to satisfy most people's desires from indulgent porkbelly croquetas to a relatively healthy grilled branzino. After studying the menu and going through our usual ritual of debating the virtues of Dish X over Dish Y, compared to Dish Z, we settled on: -Warm Butternut Squash (brown butter shallots, dates, cauliflower, kale, proscuitto) which was well-balanced and flavorful. (4 stars) -Endive Salad (frisÃ©e, bacon vinaigrette, parmigiano tuile) which was light, surprisingly zesty and offset the heavier dishes, though it's probably not a go-to dish in it's own right. (3 stars) -Grilled Octopus (bacalao purÃ©e, pickled pearl onion, tomato) which we thought was good, but not amazing. I did enjoy the bacalao purÃ©e, though. (3 stars) -Half Roasted Organic Chicken, which was very tender and flavorful. (4 stars) -Tiramisu, which was exceedingly decadent. (4 stars) -The manager also informed us that the polenta was a signature dish of the restaurant and provided us with a free serving. While neither of us are huge fans of polenta, this was rather exceptional -- we'll certainly be back for more. Conclusion: All the items at this low-key establishment were very good, and we'll most certainly return to try the other delicious-sounding offerings. If it is sheer decadence you are after, perhaps Traif is the better destination though - if you are looking to diversify your flavor palate with items that range from ""reasonably healthy"" to ""heart-stoppingly"" indulgent - this may provide a more balanced approach to tapas in the neighborhood. With excellent staff, an unobtrusive ambiance, and very good food, this is certainly a restaurant on which to keep your eye.",1
"This place is pretty cool for lunch. If you're not there with 8 of your friends, they will sit you with some random people at a big 10 person table most likely with tourists. It's a whole other experience this way, and I'm a big fan. My friend and I shared a lot of small plates including the crab meat and pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Which were all delicious! The Quail quarters were the typical slightly overcooked, crispy skinned deliciousness. And I'm from NorCal, so I haven't had or haven't been exposed to the fried turnip ball that is full of WIN. Also try the peanut noodles if you're not so adventurous. They are surprisingly awesome.",1
"Boozy brunch anyone? Â I've been searching for a new place to try out (not that Cafe Cortadito isn't still my #1) and Fonda came up. Â Their brunch options are slightly on the spicy side for me but I just asked for them to take it easy and they obliged as much as possible. Â Thanks to plenty of Rosalitas (their hibiscus margaritas) I managed to make it through the spiciness. Â The only hiccup was that this place is known for all-you-can-drink rowdy brunch yet some of the patrons were annoyed with us for being loud. Â I tend to feel like you should know what you are getting into at a place like this and should avoid the typical Sunday brunch hour if that's not what you are looking for (not to sound like a jerk). Â And we kept it contained to our table. Â One person sitting at the bar got in my face about not tipping on the bill which was completely untrue per our waiter who said we had left a very generous tip and frankly none of her business in the first place. Â Unfortunately, that really tempered my experience and was enough to make me not really want to come back.",1
Everything except pork !!! Delicious food,1
"This place is truly a hidden gem. I'd describe the decor as Cape Cod classy. The service is fantastic, and the food is delicious. I'd recommend the tempura string bean appetizer, the pea ravioli and all the fish dishes.",1
"I love going here at the end of most of my study adventures because it closes at 3am every day of the week. Because I always come at the end of my excursions, I confess that I have never walked into Woorijip with any feeling other than ""I already ate way too much."" I have also never experienced this place when it was ""way too crowded"" like many other reviewers who actually come during normal times. To find me at Woorijip before midnight would be very unusual, as I am usually across the street at Food Gallery 32 until it closes at midnight. I will say that the takeout food I've had was pretty good, given that I was very much in the fed state each time. However, Woorijip always has this slightly ""off"" smell to it every time I walk in that is slightly unsettling. I try to shake it off every time. It is probably just the smell of all the different foods mixed together. Lastly, they have a pretty nice alcohol collection, enough to inhibit lots of ADH release from your posterior pituitary, thereby resulting in a high volume of dilute urine!",1
Came here for dinner to try their yakatori. I must say they have a good selection of skewers and interesting dishes. Really liked the steamed sticky balls with chicken and the rolled omelet. But in terms of price and comparable enjoyment Liked ootoya and sake bar hagi better. The yakatori taste wasn't dramatically better then what you might find in st marks. But the quality of the ingredients was pretty good. It was a good place to check out and try but I I can't say I was blown away by it.,1
"Excellent brunch! Can't wait to try dinner Amazing: Biscuit Pancakes with Fried chicken - so good!! Biscuit and eggs with turkey sausage gravy - to die for! The service is impeccable! The wrong dish was first brought out and the owner/manager noticed our questioning looks (we weren't sure if we ordered correctly), asked what was wrong, and quickly reassured us that we would bring out the correct plate. It was in front of us in 2 minutes. Also the Left Hand Stout Float is an awesome desert!",1
"Favorite ramen place in the city, either location because the quality is superb. I almost always order the shishito peppers for starters. I like the spicy paste to add to any of the ramens. Definitely worth the wait which could be long if it's busy.",1
favorite tapas in the city!,1
"I'm a horrible friend. Â I'll drop your Macbook Air in front of an oncoming 2 train. Â Or wreck your car's transmission. Â Or pick really crappy restaurants for a girl's night out. Suanne L. gave me an important assignment: find a restaurant prior to the screening of ""A Matter of Taste"" at the Tribeca Film Festival. Â We descended upon Tia Pol because it is in the vicinity of the theater and I have only been turned away twice now. Â And everybody knows that you always want what you can't have. Tia Pol's menu promised us an experience with simple and traditional tapas. Â FaltÃ³ a la promesa. We shared: Pimientos Estilo Gernika - A close relative of the padron pepper (they both belong to the Capsicum annuum family). Â These were not only doused in oil, but did not have the slight crispness the pepper should typically still have. Wild Ramps a La Plancha - Ironically, one of the most over-harvested, ""trendy"" greens of the moment also happened to be the best plate of the evening. Â Extremely salty. Almejas al Vino - Clams prepared in a white wine sauce. Â The white wine sauce was super salty and garlicky. Â Not impressed. Croquettas de Jamon - The innards of the croquettes were undercooked. Â Presence of ham was questionable. Duck Heart Skewers - Along with the ramps, these were a special of the evening. Â It is difficult to describe the flavors because these were also heavily salted. Ensaladita de Pulpo con Patata - Absurd. Â For $13, we were served a small salad that was mostly thinly sliced potatoes, green bell peppers, onions, and a little bit of fennel. Â There were maybe six miniscule cross-sections of tough octopus (1cm in diameter would be a generous estimate). For dessert, I ordered leche frita (a delicious Basque indulgence made with milk, flour, and eggs). Â These looked perfect - until I cut into one. Â The inside was undercooked - very runny for a dessert that should have more of a pudding/custard consistency. Tapas bars are supposed to be an experience - friends gather for a few drinks, catch up, and enjoy fresh, flavorful (and in Spain, inexpensive) small plates. Â Instead, we bought up some shtick from a bunch of marketing gurus/restaurant consultants looking to squeeze margins from their patrons and serve sub-par food (or fleur de sel, depending on how you see the world). Â No me gusta.",1
"I love this place. Every time that I'm in NYC, I make sure that I get an evening stop in to Saki Bar Hagi. It never ceases to please my palate. I enjoy sitting at the bar and making friends with other diners. I've met other travelers, New Yorkers and the like. The bartender is very helpful with making recommendations for sake, yakitori and other items. He'll tell you if something is going to take a long time, and if you might want to order something else to eat while the other items are being made. Always tasty!",1
"Having lived in Istanbul for four months about a year ago, I am always craving Turkish food. I chose this place because it was nearby where I was at the moment and it had good Yelp reviews. However, I was incredibly disappointed. The entree options were extremely limited. They were missing many classic Turkish dishes that most other Turkish restaurants in New York have. There were however, many good appetizer options. I would recommend the Sigara Borek from the appetizers. This is a common food in Turkey. It is Phyllo dough stuffed with Turkish Feta Cheese. It is simple, but incredibly delicious. The main problem was that our food took an hour to come! There were only four of us. All the tables next to us (one that even had 10 people) that came in after us were getting our food while we were not! After 45 minutes, I asked our waitress how our food was coming along; she went to the kitchen to check and came back and said ""3-4 minutes."" That was not true at all. We waited another 15 minutes! When the food finally came, she said in a disinterested, deadpan voice: ""Sorry there was a problem in the kitchen. Do you want more bread?"" That is terrible customer service! I went to the manager to explain the situation. He said he would bring us Baklava. A little while later, he came up to the second floor while we were sitting. I saw him talk to the waitress, who rolled her eyes and then came over to us to snarkily ask if we wanted complimentary coffee or tea. One of my friends asked for a coffee. Then a minute later, one of my other friends decided he wanted tea. When he tried to tell the waitress, she said in a very rude tone,""Ugh you changed your mind......"" like it was such a pain for her to take down his order. The baklava was good. But surely doesn't make up for the hour wait and incredibly rude, unapologetic waitress. Overall, very disappointed in this place. Coming here truly put a damper on our evening as we were all in terrible moods when we left.",1
"I spent a lot of time in Chinatown in my younger days, and one of the ""go to"" spots in the area for a quick, reliable bite was Big Wong. Â I have incredibly fond memories of my parents taking me there and getting me traditional dishes like congee with deep fried dough to dip in, or the occasional dinner (which I always found to be special since we mostly went there for lunch) with wonderfully cooked noodles or vegetables. Fast forward many years and I still go to Big Wong regularly when I need a relatively inexpensive, satisfying and tasty lunch. Â The facade has changed of the years, as has the interior. Â There's a lot of brick work in the front and the interior is mostly dark wood furniture with red colors all about (the traditional Chinese color of luck). Â The walls have a mish mosh of paintings and menu offerings. Â It definitely still has the charm of an old skool Chinatown establishment, but the place is kept clean and comfortable (trust me, about twenty five years ago it was a different story). The service is fast, gruff and most of the time you're lucky if a waiter even has a chance to check on you during the meal. Â They're usually jam packed and the waiters are running around like chickens without their heads. Â Your best bet is to flag a waiter down if you need something, not wait for them to come to you (and I count half a star against them for this since so much of their clientele is now tourists, who aren't used to this sort of treatment). I've had a lot of different things here, but here are the three things I have most often to give you an idea about the food: CONGEE (with salted pork, century egg, ginger and scallion) Congee, for the uninitiated is basically a porridge of sorts created using rice instead of oats. Â This rice base can be combined with almost any savory ingredient to create a bowl of deliciousness. Â My personal favorite is the version with salted pork, century egg (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceâ€¦) and scallions and ginger. Â It's a very simple dish but it is hearty, thick (almost like a stew) and absolutely delicious. Â It's fresh made, so it's always served piping hot and the heat really helps the flavors of the other ingredients soak in. If you really want to go into carb overload, order the fried dough (it looks like a deep fried, golden cruller). Â  There are two versions, one plain and one with a crusted layer of sugar on top. Â Either one goes really well with the congee. WONTON SOUP (with egg noodles and scallion) Another warm, comfort dish. Â Egg noodles are served in a beautiful chicken broth with scallions added in for flavor. Â The wontons are a mixture of pork and shrimp and are perfectly sized for two bites of deliciousness! Â Dash some white pepper in (provided at each table) for some awesome ""kick"". ROAST PORK Made in a sweet style, this dish is best when the outside is a deep red and glistening and the interior has small layers of fat in it to give it an extra satisfying texture and flavor. Â However, Big Wong loses another half star because on occasion the roast pork can be a bit dry, but 95% of the time it's awesome. Honorable mentions go to their Lobster (two for $20 with a ginger/scallion sauce), roast duck (totally delicious and fatty) and their beef with broad noodles, which is one of my favorite dishes! Big Wong is a Chinatown institution and definitely deserves a visit from you!",1
"I came here for lunch on a weekday. Â Trying to get reservations for dinner is pretty tough unless you want the 5:30 pm or 10:15pm slot on open table. The restaurant has a cozy ambiance. Â Everything on the menu looks great. Our table ordered the lamb meatball sliders, eggplant mozzarella crostini of the day, the salmon and a shrimp salad. Â Everything was delicious. Would definitely go back for dinner one time if it weren't so hard to get a reservation for a proper time.",1
"The Squares and the Spumoni's are really good but I still feel that L& B is overrated. I have dined inside at their restaurant and outside, both occasions were cool, but I don't see what all the hype is about, both times I have visited I came on spur of the moment thing, not like think about this pizza or look forward to coming here. The have a full menu of everything but their main star attraction is their Squares & Spumoni's which is why I am giving them 4 stars, I know my review contradicts my star rating but once again their Squares and Spumoni's are really good, but that's about it which is all I am saying. Try the Pistachio Spumoni.",1
"I have been to a bunch of places for Falafel. I have been to Rainbow in Union Square, both Â Mamoun's, King of Falafel on Broadway in Astoria Â Olive Tree, numerous places on Steinway street, Pita Pan ,Sito's, Jerusalem Cafe and several others, I can't remember all the names. I am 47 years old. Old enough to be most Yelper's mother. So I want to give you a bit of amusing American trivia. We did not grow up with TV shows like Dr. OZ and we didn't have the food pyramid. We had the four basic food groups. They are wheat or grain, protein, vegetables and dairy. I remember hearing all food is health food because all food keeps you alive. Â  (during the beginning of the health food craze.) I even remember while being taught about nutrition in school that pizza was the perfect food because it has wheat for the crust, the vegetable was the sauce and dairy was the cheese and meat if you top it with that. Also a Â cheese burger was considered to be the perfect food, meat, a tomato or ketchup for the vegetable, cheese for the dairy Â and wheat for the bun. That is how they started to put pizza and burgers in school lunches. They actually taught that it was healthy. I know, way cool don't you wish you went to school when I did? Anyway I have a nutritionists certification and have been through several food stages and phases in my life. ""Health food"" was one of them. I said all of that to say that Taim tastes like every health food restaurant I have had Falafel at. It lacks the crunch Â and greasy flavor that you get at traditional Middle Eastern restaurants. On a positive note it is healthy and unique. I have had their Pomegranate iced tea and young coconut juice and brown sugar lemonade. Their drinks are good and unique. I tried it twice because it was so highly rated that I wanted to make sure it wasn't me. The first time it was raining and I had so many errands to run that by the time I got home I figured the food lost it's flavor. But no that is not the case. I went Â a second time and was just as under whelmed. I also was not pleased with the limited menu and I made some special requests and they were accommodating. That I give them credit for and for the healthy aspect and for their customer service. But on taste alone I have to say pass it by there are better it is just that they found a unique nitch which is healthy Middle Eastern in a cool neighborhood with very modern and unique drinks. I am not Â a newbie to Middle Eastern food. Taim is not authentic Middle eastern but they are original and healthy.",1
This is a place with awesome pizza! Be sure to bring someone with you to share the pie with. I went here last week for lunch with friends and we ordered two pies for 5 people. It was SO good!,1
"So apparently this is the place where all the Spanish people go to have traditional Spanish tapas...or so I was told. Â I guess this makes sense, because when we walked in and tried to order, everything was already out for the night - the waiter just shook his head and said ""there were a lot of Spanish here tonight"". Â He may have said ""Spaniards"", but i suspect my mind changed it to ""Spaniards"" and I fear my mind can be a little racist without my knowledge, so in case ""Spaniards"" is a derogatory term, I'll have to assume he didn't say it. Now that that's out of the way. Â The best thing about this place? the atmosphere is ADORABLE. Â If you don't care about food quality, this is a fantastic date place. Amazing. you walk in, and you initially become skeptical because it's ""garden level"" which, as most of you know, means ""basement"". Â Gross. Â However, the room opens up to this brick-facade-d, dimly-lit, soft orange/red glowing cozy little nook of a restaurant. Â Insta-romance, folks. Â The place is for the guy who says ""i want to make my gal think I'm a little bit romantic and a little bit fun, wrapped in a coating of laid-back."" The food we were able to get our hands on (as everything was out) was a meager order of blood sausage (too dry and chewy but otherwise OK) and a greasy dish of octopus pieces. Â Sadly, the octopus chunks were all covered in fat and too greasy to get a good grasp on long enough to travel to my mouth, so we left hungry and disappointed. However, the sangria was delicious, the service was great (friendly Spanish man to pop up occasionally when we least expected it), and the vibe was perfect. Â Will i go back? Sure. but only to sit at the bar and have a drink with friends.",1
"I tried Cafe Cluny after a friend highly recommended it. Went there for an early afternoon Sunday brunch and was not disappointed. I was in the mood for pancakes and they unfortunately didn't have any on the menu! To make up for that I split the berry French toast with a friend. It was amazing! Brioche bread drenched in a yummy batter. The toast was nice and crisp on the outside and flavorful on the inside. The fruit accompanying it was very fresh as well. For my actual dish I had the egg sandwich (minus the bacon). It was toasted white bread with spicy mayo, avocado, tomato and a sunny side up egg. Such a simple combination but put together it becomes one delicious meal. We also had Â a side of hash brown potatoes that were very good as well. I don't usually drink at brunch because I'm not a Bellini/mimosa person and bloody mary's are usually too spicy for me, but at the suggestion of the same friend I went ahead and ordered one - loved it! I definitely plan on coming back here for brunch and would love to come by and try the dinner menu as well.",1
"For the longest time, I have heard nothing but good reviews about this place, but I have not had the chance to try it out... until recently. My father has been here dozens upon dozens of times and has never said anything bad about it. I finally ordered my first falafel pita with hummus and it was absolutely delicious! I am not a huge fan of falafel, but this particular falafel at Hummus & Pita is very good. The hummus in the pita was really creamy and had a nice flavor to it. My pita was stuffed to full capacity and it was a very filling meal. I had a nice cold Blue Moon to accompany my falafel pita and it was the perfect lunch meal. It is a sort of assembly line process... similar to Chipotle and it is a pretty quick process from start to finish. There is a lot of seating and communal seating as well. It is very clean inside as well, which is always a plus. I will definitely be back here when I'm in that area.",1
"Seriously, these are the best dumplings in NYC. I've been here a couple of times now and it is by far one of my favorite spots in the city. It's a hole in the wall kind of place in the Lower East Side -there are probably a total of four seats inside the restaurant -but that's why you should immediately assume you'll be taking your dumplings to go. Heck, you'll finish them so fast you won't even notice you ate them before you even got outside! Which is more reason to stop by one of the neighborhood bars (cough cough, Top Hops) afterwards. Quick service, cheap eats (four dumplings for $1 does it get any better than that?!) and just the greatest dumplings you'll ever have. Go all out and get the sesame pancake too!",1
"Have you ever tried Japanese curry? It's the subject of much devotion and fanaticism, but outside of Japan it's relatively unknown. In the US, when people discuss Japanese food, they immediately think of sushi, teriyaki, and ramen. But in Japan, curry is actually eaten more frequently than any of those dishes. There are numerous lunch counters that serve nothing but curry. Japanese people think of it as a familiar comfort food, something that Mom made often. Given the fact that curry is practically Japan's national dish, good Japanese-style curry is surprisingly difficult to find here in the States. In NYC, we're lucky enough to have a few places to choose from, but Go!Go! Curry is perhaps the best known. With multiple locations, Go!Go! Curry is here to fulfill all your Japanese curry cravings. I recently visited their Midtown location, which definitely fits the description of ""hole-in-the wall."" Â Nearly every available surface is plastered with pictures, news articles, and anime. However, one of the wackiest aspects of Go!Go! Curry is that the entire place is basically a shrine to retired baseball player Hideki Matsui. See, the number Matsui wore was 55, and in phonetic Japanese, ""go"" means 5. Hence, ""go go"" = five-five. The menu is quite limited: it's basically just curry over rice. You choose the toppings and the size. The sizes are baseball-related, ranging from Walk, which is the smallest size, to Single, Double, and Triple. I opted for a simple pork katsu over rice ($7 for a small). The curry sauce is a dark brown gloop, but it definitely tastes better than it looks. Its sweet-savory flavor comes from curry powder, garam masala, and fruit, among other ingredients. The thin, breaded pork cutlet is topped with tonkatsu sauce, which tastes a bit like Worcestershire. I also got a side of fukuzinzuke, or crunchy pickled daikon radish. To read more, visit bit.ly/1wTCDsS",1
"First time here - ordered the Chilaquiles, the right amount of cross over from breakfast to lunch for my branching needs with a bit of a kick to it. Of course when I saw the biscuits I had to get one for myself, not a southern biscuit if that's what you are expecting but it was truly delicious. Paired with a creamy butter and jam that tasted like cotton candy - not in the gross way ice cream or other candies do sometimes but in the very slightest way possible. Tied everything off with a glass of the freshly squeezed orange juice - good but nothing overly special. Downside - waited 45 mins for a table. Worth the wait on the nice day outside with good company. Plus - the food came out quickly once ordered.",1
"love the place/ambiance came here for brunch had the french onion soup, a little salty for my tastes eggs were good, and the scrambled eggs in pasty puff was always delish saw a lot of beef stroganoff go around, might order that next time",1
"Ok sooo I guess you can add me to the Ippudo bandwagon because holy hell is it amazing. I don't know what to say. The creamy garlicy broth in the Akamaru Modern with seasoned boiled egg and pork belly gives me wet dreams. The ramen was perfectly al dente, pork belly was soft and tender, and the hard boiled egg was perfectly seasoned and yolky, the broth was well seasoned and not salty - hands down THE BEST ramen or soup or anything I've ever had.",1
"Came here with some friends and coworkers - I've got to say that I so far agree with my friend's assessment that this is the best ramen place in town. Â You can see by my other reviews of ramen places (specifically, Ippudo) that I'm not generally enthused by ramen. That said, I found Totto Ramen to be very good - the food here helped me understand why people are crazy about ramen (though obviously, not every place place is Totto Ramen). Â A very rich broth, great noodles, and good meat and other bits. Â Their unagi appetizer was also very good - good balance of saltiness with the rice. Â And all of it was at a very reasonable price. Of course, there is a long wait to get in, so arrive early, and preferably with 4 people. Â The place is quite small, and the back had a little funk to it - which goes to show you just how good the ramen was to make up for such shortcomings. We had no problems with pushy waitstaff (they were all very friendly).",1
"I can't speak much for the wait time, since we stopped in on a whim after doing some shopping in Soho in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday when it was mostly empty. Â Maybe because the World Cup game was on? Â The food was good and fairly priced. Â The service was good and the food came out quickly. Â Not much more to say here, other than we will definitely be back again when we are in the area shopping.",1
"I didn't want to be a fan of the most ubiquitous burger place in new york...but they serve a helluva mean burger. Thick, juicy patty that cannot be contained by its bun at the tail end of your beefy sojourn. The paper plate below does only what it can to catch the mess. It's too dark to see that your mug of Mcsorley's is smeared with meat juice, as you wash down a near perfect burger.",1
"We had brunch here on Sunday and didn't have the best experience. Service was horrifically slow (I had to ask for menus and flag the server down to take our orders). It looked like they only had two servers for the packed restaurant, though, so I was cutting them some slack. Our food took forever to come. My boyfriend's steak was overcooked but tasty (though small), and his eggs were so oily that he didn't eat them. My burger was raw (I'd asked for it well-done). It was literally cold in the middle. I asked them to cook it more (and I NEVER send food back). It came back burnt. They'd put the entire burger, bun, toppings, and all, on the grill and burnt it to a crisp. (But somehow, it was still pink in the middle.) It was over an hour since we arrived at that point, so I tried to just eat it. It was disgusting. The server was very kind and ordered me something else, but I was just over it by that point. I'm hoping this was just an infrequent screw-up by someone hungover in the kitchen, but between the slow service and the undercooked/burnt food, we didn't have a good experience. It took literally two hours for both of us to eat.",1
"Hubs & I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this High Class, Simplistic approach to Southern fare. I HATE lamb but ate almost ALL of my hubs grilled lamb dish. It was marinated to tender, juicy charred perfection. The Grilled Corn Appetizer is TO DIE 4! I swipe-licked the sweet butter off the plate w my fingers. I would've done like I do at home but didnt want to embarrass the hubs any further. The Small Plates are ""exactly"" that, small, almost miniscule but delish! Blue Crab Waldorf (ode to my granny) is a great lite starter...again, I needed/wanted MUCH more! My entree was actually the Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. Good (needed more seasoning) but the other dishes were better. We had NO room for dessert but WILL be returning soon & eating dessert 1st! Drinks compliment this Bourbon-Whisky laced place. Hub's Blackberry & Bourbon was AMAZING. I had both Chenin Blanc (Cali, im usually partial to France) & the Sauvignon-Blanc-Aussie (surprisingly delish, im usually a NZ SNOB!) In the end, a Chaise Lounge & Personal Trainer is needed with each reservation! EXCELLENT! Â We'll definitely be returning, bringing family & friends & highly recommending! Tight quarters but we'll make it work. Chefs Jeff & Janine, are EXTREMELY friendly & engaging WITHOUT losing focus on the star-the dishes! Their staff, especially host Kate is highly attentive & accomodating! Other servers quickly saw to our needs when our server was busy. Extra Bonus: CLEAN Bathrooms! (We ALWAYS check out 1st & leave when this is a problem! Can't stand a nasty bathroom!)",1
"This place is great for cheap thai food. As a former college student needing cheap eats and having lived two minutes away, Bodhi Tree was life and still is. You can't beat the lunch special. $7 for an entree AND two appetizers is simply too much of a bargain. I've only had the drunk man noodle for lunch and it is top notch. I usually get Bodhi Tree for takeout, but just went yesterday for dinner and sat down to eat. Ordered the pineapple thai fried rice, which was very good as well. Two friends of mine, however, ordered a dish with vegetable and tofu, and the place forgot tofu on both dishes. Didn't affect my eating experience, but it affects the overall experience when friends aren't getting what they ordered. Probably won't be sitting down and eating here again, but its lunch specials are still a go-to for me.",1
"We stopped in tonight and the chicken is moist and flavorful and the pita bread is quite good. We were not as impressed with the chicken breast sandwich because we both like the one at the OxCart Tavern is juicier and has more flavor. Service is friendly but because the restaurant is so small, it does get loud. Another nice touch is the refrigerated bottles of tap water.",1
"I was introduced to Cha-An last summer when I met up with a friend here. I'm glad for that, because this is a wonderful teahouse with great tea and food. Some of the food and drinks I've had here include the chef's dessert assortment (yogurt-flavored ice cream with a sesame cracker, green tea mousse cake and sakura flan, and soy bean macaron and green tea cookie), chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce, macarons (chocolate, green tea, and Earl Grey), matcha latte, jasmine pearl tea, and flower craft tea, all of which were good; my favorites were the green tea mousse, chocolate souffle, and Earl Grey macarons. The soy bean macaron's filling was too sweet, and the souffle's raspberry sauce was too sour, but another friend that I came here with liked it. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet, intimate place to eat, drink, and chat.",1
"Tasty steak and eggs for brunch. Also tried their pancakes and French toast. All of their food was quite good. The place was quite packed, so it's a good idea to make reservations or plan to wait. Drinks are a little expensive at $9 a glass for smallish servings. Coffee refills were pretty slow too. Great food, service a little slow, but definitely worth the visit.",1
So cute and cozy! On a quiet street (hard to find in Manhattan) in the West Village. It's tiny so a reservation is ideal if possible. The atmosphere is perfect for a date or intimate dinner. The food is delicious- try the risotto!,1
"I came here for lunch since we I was in the mood for seafood. The place was packed you would think it was dinner time. We got a table and they brought Â us some warm sesame seed bread with olive oil, the bread was really fresh and delicious. They do have a cheaper lunch menu however we decided to go with the regular one. I like place that don't limited you to the just a few lunch items. I went with the bronzino with lemon potatoes. They give you a choice of the whole fish or filet, I'm not a fan of picking through my fish so I went with filet. The fish was huge I just wish they hadn't included the head and tail ( I personally find it very unappealing). The fish and lemon potatoes were very tasty and I got to take half of the fish home since it was so large.",1
One of the best restaurants in Astoria and one of the greatest panini type restaurants in the world--seriously. I've had the entire menu and I know their primary supplier. I prefer the crostinis to the paninis but everything is great.,1
"Food came out quickly, they were very quick with sangria refills, and the food was pretty tasty. But my boyfriend got the skirt steak and though it was good, it was a very small portion",1
"I've heard about this place and read reviews about it but hadn't gotten around to trying it til this past weekend. Â One my cousins is a huge fan of Calle Ocho so I was looking forward to checking it out for myself. Â First obvious thing that draws in their customers...complimentary unlimited sangria throughout the course of your brunch..SCORE! Â (I'm actually not a big drinker so I'm probably one of their more favored customers, haaa).. Â They offer 10+ different types of sangria which is cool cause you can try as many different ones as you want (but they wont give you a new glass of sangria until you finish whats in your glass). Their starter bread basket is amazingggg!!!!!!! Â It comes with a strawberry butter (I think that's what it was?). Â It comes with corn bread, this donut-y kind of bread, and this circle round ball of HEAVEN. Â It was so good, I think I consumed 5-6 of them in the span of 10 minutes. Â (Yup, I'm a total oinker!!) Entrees- We tried the burrito (good but not amazing), beef strips with rice (probably the best dish we tried), cubano sandwich (not good but the fries were good), quesadillas (good), plantains (good) and yuca fries (good). Â for dessert we shared the banana tres leches (good) and creme brulee (good). Â  Overall the food was good (but not absolutely amazing either) but I still rate it a 5 because....unlimited sangria (I got drunk off of HALF a glass of sangria...I am the weakest weaksauce girl of them all :P), amazing bread basket, amazing quick service, and pretty decent food (I think the only thing I wouldnt ever really order again would be the cubano sandwich). Ill be back soon again!",1
"The food was good. We ordered calamari, a 12 inch pizza with zucchini and mushrooms , gnocchi and a pasta dish with speck. Everything tasted fresh and arrived promptly. I would've rated it 3 stars if the waiter didn't stomp his foot and looked uninterested when he took our order because he got impatient! This totally threw us off and made us order the wrong dish because we wanted to expedite the process (although it was delicious). Sorry but bad service really kills it for me!",1
"Let's weigh it out: Pros: really cheap ($5 a bowl of noodles soup of any kind on the menu, $2-$3 for 8-12 dumplings) fast unassuming noodles were of good quality Cons: bit on the divey side don't change your order midway in, as they won't change it no restroom the broth could have been better, that's the bones of the soup you will have to get used to the slapping sound of the noodles hitting the boarded table as they are made about five steps from where you are sitting, almost feels like a slave is being lashed with a whip.",1
"Unreal. I was there yesterday and although the place is small, I dont care. As long as I have a seat, I am fine. I ordered the chicken curry (M) and it was absolutely incredible. The food is consistent in all locations. Â I cannot compare it to any other Japanese curry so I am not sure how authentic it is but it sure is incredibly yummy. It was a little cold yesterday so this was especially yummy and comforting to have this late afternoon early dinner meal. It was like someone wrapped my favorite blanket around me and hugged me. It was comforting and so very tasty. Â I just cannot even begin to describe how good it is. It is fresh, super hot and comes with a REAL fork and stainless plate/bowl. Â I agree that its best to eat in as the panko crust disintergrates if you order to take out but sometimes I must get some on my way home. You can easily have a meal for about $10 here.",1
Solid food and service. love the steak tar tar and burger. The kitchen is open until 2am so that's always a plus!,1
"We started with some appetizers. First, we went with the Pork Sticky Rolls. WATCH OUT: They're addicting. They only supply two of these crack-infested rolls per order. They're sweet, tangy, meaty, heavenly... I could eat 69 of these. They kind of remind me of Cinnabon rolls... but with more pork and less diabetes. Next, we got the Duck Fat Fries with Malted Spiced Yogurt. They turned out flavorful and crispy. The sauce was really nice, creamy, and refreshing. Don't know what spices they use but it was bomb. Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Salsa Verde, Poached Egg, Home Fries: I'm a big fan of anything ""pulled"" just because it's juicy, meaty, and convenient to eat. You get a sexy chunk of meat with each bite. It seems a bit hard to eat as a sandwich because of the poached egg but it's fine when you eat it as an open-faced sandwich. The home fries it came with were gorgeous. They were seasoned very well. It reminded us of something you would flavor chips with. It came with a mixed salad with a refreshing vinaigrette. VEGETABLES, yo. Southern Fried Rice: This dish is super hearty. And unless you're starving, you'll be taking home some leftovers. If you're not into pickles, the taste isn't too overwhelming but it's still there. The spicy sausage is the dominant flavor here and you can't go wrong with fried rice and spicy sausage. I'm really glad they added poached egg to the dish or else the fried rice would be pretty boring. The Egg Begley Jr. was my dish. Essentially, its a sandwich with kale, potatoes, and a poached egg. The poached egg was perfect because it was cooked sous vide. The brioche bread was warm and toasty. I thought the chimichurri was a pretty interesting addition. When you take a bite out of this, you get a ton of different flavors. You get to enjoy the explosive yolk, the potatoes, and the herbs and vinegar from the chimichurri. Halfway through the meal, my sandwich kind of fell apart so I put the bread aside, mixed all the fillings together, and ate it alongside the buns. They have a three-course meal available on Sundays. The menu changes almost every week to keep things interesting. The whole dinner costs $27, which is fairly affordable for three dishes.",1
"This place was amazing! Â They don't take reservations so big parties might have a difficulty finding a table. Â It's all about timing with this place! We had some eggplant and tandoori chicken as appetizers to share. Â Both dishes were tender and came with naan. We had the chicken tagine and grill platter. Â Everything was cooked to perfection. Â The 4 chicken pieces from the tagine were a bit small but very savory. Â We didn't have room for dessert, but people did order.",1
"Good hearty American food with quality ingredients. Always in the mood to come here when I just want a solid meal that isn't too fussy but just hits all the right places. It's like a diner but with a great chef and the best meats and produce. Organic and grass fed meats. Have been here for brunch and dinner Everything is always super satisfying. Always an enjoyable meal. Love getting steaks here. Â  Not the cheapest meal and there is always a line (if you want to beat the brunch crowd and don't care to drink, come before 11). Comfortable seating. Open 24 hours.",1
"For all the hype, I was sorely disappointed with my first meal here. Perhaps I ordered the wrong item, but overall this was definitely a ""Meh"" dining experience. On an early Friday afternoon I decided to brave the infamous lines at CSBC. The sidewalk was chock full of tourists and I inwardly groaned. Sometimes you just want to be a local, with other locals, and not hang out with gaggles of tourists with their cameras and guidebooks. Oh well. The wait was customarily long and the highlight was the hostess brought out a plate of pancake wedges and a ramekin of maple syrup for us to sample and stave off the hunger. The slice I had was delicious and I should have just ordered pancakes. But nooo....I went for the Potato Pancakes. Now I am a huge fan of the potato pancake but like a lot of dishes in life (i.e. nachos), these are just best cooked at home. I sat at the bar and the server was friendly and attentive. My order came out and it consisted of three miserably overcooked pucks of shredded potato. Someone on the grill clearly didn't know how to cook these. I had to cut off the burnt edges and choke them down. A side of applesauce and cinnamon sour cream were blah and bland, nothing special. i should have sent them back and ordered pancakes but my mistake. I will give them one more try for pancakes but it won't be anytime soon. Having to fight crowds of Europeans for breakfast isn't my idea of a good time.",1
Pretty fab sliders. Tried two the other day: double bacon and pulled pork. Pulled pork won by a LONG shot and I'm a huge fan of bacon. Shocking. The double bacon wasn't doing it for me --- Lacked flavor and creativity. Maybe I just don't like bacon stuffed into the patty... I want to see and touch it and smell it before I put it into my mouth. That's gotta be it... Just get the pulled pork and you'll be goldennnn. So much flavor packed into such a tiny burger. Service was great btw and super fast. We went in around 4 pm on a Thursday afternoon and it was slow. Perfect time! Small venue but there seems to be plenty of seating. Why would you go to white castle when there is this place?? Because you're high. That's no excuse to eat bad food though... lol,1
"The noodles are absolutely fantastic, especially if you like chewy noodles like I do. The broth, however, tastes a bit underwhelming and falls far behind the top-notch quality of the noodles. Beef noodle is definitely recommended !",1
"For a table of three, we waited half a hour. It was all worth it in the end- the soup dumplings were amazing and we ended up ordering 2 orders. We didn't realize how generous the portions were going to be so we each ordered a dish and by the end of two dishes, we were too full to take on the next. The total was just under $50, which I think was a reasonable price for a place so phenomenal.",1
My favorite lunch spot! Sandwiches are delicious and big! What else can you ask for. Â  Â  Salads are good as well,1
"DELICIOUS! I came here recently with some friends for dinner and we ordered the following: pan con tomate; razor clams a la plancha; creamy eggs with sea urchin, walnuts, lime and ancient anchovy oil; pulpo with fennel and grapefruit; confit goat with avocado queso, scallion ash and pistachios; pork belly & chanterelles with swiss chard purÃ©e and anchovy vinaigrette; and chorizo meatballs with garbanzo purÃ©e and sweet and spicy chili paste. My favorites were the razor clams and pulpo (grilled octopus). The only thing that was a bit dry was the confit goat. We also paired our meal with a great Malbec-esque wine. I highly recommend this place, but make sure you get reservations well in advance! -L.",1
"Find this place on yelp looked like a cute place in the neighborhood. I made a note to myself to check out their margarita night and happy hour specials. I finally made it over for lunch one day at their cute location near the Brooklyn Bridge. We sat down it was rather cold inside. The service was pretty slow, I asked advice on what to order and of course each item was soooo good. That may be but that does not really help, I like people being honest about their opinion, anyway I chose the fish tacos. They took awhile to come out. They are definitely interesting. The fish inside was burnt you could peal the chewy skin completely off. There was a mango like sauce on top, with cabbage and toasted capers. Was not my cup of tea. My friend got the Shrimp Po'Boy and said it was tasty. The guacamole we ordered in the beginning was decent nothing to rave about. I didn't get to taste their drinks because it was so early. I think its a place I'd try later in the evening for some cocktails and snacks but wasn't thrilled with the food and service (and having to wear my jacket inside). I'll have to update after I return. Update The margaritas were really good, I came back in and I ordered the frozen strawberry one. Tasty! They also had a live jazz band playing.",1
"We came at this one magic hour where there were 3 seats available at the bar as well as the shared table in the back. SCORE! As the warmth of the restaurant defrosted our appendages I ordered what everyone recommended - the dry noodles with crab and pork. Extremely delicious, great with extra hot sauce, would come again just for that dish. My friend's seafood noodle soup looked amazing too!",1
"really had a pleasant sunday dinner here at the gander. the ambience was nice, the food was delicious and the service was great. i ordered the mushroom and uni orzo and beet tortellini, both of which i thought had fresh ingredients. Â the sides of asparagus and cauliflower were also well done. literally a head of cauliflower appeared on our table. Â we pretty much were the last table to close down the restaurant and at no point did we feel pressured to leave. Â wonderful place for small and large parties!",1
The Haandi of K-town. That's all that needs to be said.,1
i have found my favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurant on this planet. i wish i could give this place a 6th star. that is all.,1
I imagine this is what going to the cafeteria in a wealthy Korean high school would be like. Â Plus booze.,1
"Two words for y'all: SANGRIA BRNCH! I guess I should add some more words like ""ALL YOU CAN DRINK"" in front of that! Yep, there is no denying that Calle Ocho has THE BEST brunch deal in NYC. It's free, unlimited sangria brunch, and it's even good Sangria. Now you know you should have already made reservations three weeks ago for the peek brunch time, because come 4pm, the Sangria is shipped off to the magical world from which it came for another 7 days! Now, they do actually also sell food here, and while prices have gone up over the years, it's still a great deal for a solid brunch. They have Spanish style fritadas in iron skillets, the classic steak and eggs, burgers, and several more unique dishes to boot. They drop off a bread basket while you wait (which is not very long, they are fast here), and all the while you are filling your own glass with the 8 choices of Sangria (both Red and White wine based options)! I'd also suggest getting some Yucca fries for the table (They give you a lot), and wearing your stretchy pants. The food is salty, which makes the sangria go down faster, and the bloating come to the mid-section in record time! The wait staff are always friendly, and they have enough bus-boys to keep things moving (you can almost feel a bit rushed). The dinning room is a great, lofty space that holds the noise and the crowds well, and if you still need the one last drink for the road (get help) you can hang out front in the bar/lounge that is dark and swanky!",1
"Stop. For surely I've misheard you no? Did you just tell me (after scolding me for taking photos) that these Macarons are flown in from Paris every morning? You did? That's true? ... Need I say more? Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere? It's the epitome of class here at Laduree, from the staff dressed to the nines to the individual wrapping that comes free of charge. A step into Laduree is a step into Paris, and as you'll soon find out? That's what you'll pay for. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? Having enjoyed Macarons everywhere from Paris to Belgium, London and Los Angeles, I was honestly expecting $5.00 a pop for macarons here at Laduree. So you can imagine my shock when the price tag came to only $2.69. Yes, that sounds like a lot, but considering the quality and class here? That's nothing. Have a look at the selection: yelp.com/user_local_photâ€¦ Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? Okay. So yes, they're as authentic as is possible on this side of the Atlantic, but I was slightly disappointed at the actual taste when the atmosphere and hype were stripped away. Light and fluffy with the proper dose of chewy? Yes, but there was still a tad bit of clumping. Sweet and with a wide variety of flavors? Yes, but some like Rose Petal were just unusual, and I would have killed for a contemporary offering like Peanut Butter. Don't get me wrong. These are good, but you're not paying for the taste. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could? These are a tough three stars to give, but at the end of the day, even while these macarons are flown in from Paris daily, there are options in the city that are just as good. No Star Granted.",1
"This place was good, but I think it is overhyped. Â There are many different types of sauces, but they weren't that amazing. If you peek into the kitchen, you will see jars and jars of mayonnaise. Â The French fries are thick and made from real potatoes (you can see bags and bags of potatoes in the back as well). Â They use the same oil to fry loads of potatoes, and I'm not sure how often they change the oil... We tried the roasted eggplant, which was OK. Â (You can ask to try different sauces and they will give you the end bits of French fries to eat with them). Â We ended up getting the Parmesan Peppercorn and the Mango Chutney on regular fries (which is the smallest option they have) ($4). It was more than enough for us. Â If you get sauces on the fries, rather than in a separate container, it's only $1.50 more and they layer the sauces for you if you want more than one sauce (so they put in a layer of fries, and then a sauce, another layer of fries and then a sauce). Â If you get sauces in a separate container, it's more expensive. Â You can also opt to just get the fries with mayo and ketchup, which are free. Â  Seating is extremely limited so plan accordingly, especially if it's snowing outside.",1
"A fun place to visit if you're in the area and you need something to hold you over until your next meal. The frites here come in 3 sizes although a regular cone is more than enough to share if you feel like a light nibble. What makes these spuds fantastic? A crispy shell and a fluffy interior that's what. And there's a treasure trove of sauces available on the side if you like to dress up your fries from rosemary mayo to vietnamese pineapple. They also make a respectable poutine outside of Quebec, if you're looking for the satisfying diner staple in Manhattan. To start with the fries are a nice shape, thickly sliced they hold their own in the dish. The gravy, a tasty chicken base is thick and applied generously in each order. However, the cheese curds here don't pass the 'squeaky' test and are served too cold so they take awhile to meld properly with the fries. There is not much seating inside so take these babies to go and enjoy!",1
"I've been to Smorgasburg numerous times and always noticed the looooong line at Mighty Quinn's, but I was never wiling to wait since there were so many other options. Â On my most recent visit, while my hubby waited for food somewhere else, I decided it was time to wait for Mighty Quinn's. The line was long, probably about a 30 minute wait, but to be honest I don't know why it takes so long since there are not a ton of options for people to ponder over. Â Maybe it's the arrogant guys who think its sly to friend someone at the head of the line and pretend they are with them in order not to have to wait like the rest of us or maybe it's the MQ gal who chats them up even though they obviously cut. Anyway, let's talk about the brisket, it is pretty damn awesome. Â Melt in your mouth tender. Â Sandwiches are cut and topped to order. Â Toppings include BBQ sauce, hot peppers, cucumber slices and onions. Â Paired with the brisket it's a little piece of heaven. I now understand why the long line is always continuous and I may be inclined to wait on it again.",1
yeah baby. Yakitori to the illlest. I came here for lunch today to celebrate working overtime and the ability to digest properly after settling my nerves from a new job. Had a big bowl of lunch for 10 dollars. That's the stuff.,1
"Rye quite deftly achieves the status of high-qual-reliable neighborhood restaurant. Stationed a few blocks away from both Post Office and Dram, two of my favorite bars in williamsburg, it is a great place to go for dinner before- and/or after-drinks. Although it's by no means an affordable restaurant, I would definitely come here again for what sounds like a sick happy hour, or if I want to show one of my manhattan elitist friends what williamsburg has to offer. + braised short ribs w/ onion jam + mashed potatoes - very generously portioned and absolutely delicious. the ribs were extremely juicy and the mashed potatoes were heavenly and ultra-creamy. + grilled shrimp and scallop kebob - To me, this is the perfect summer dish. the citrus avocado salad paired with the seafood makes for a delicious, light, and refreshing dish that I would have no complaint about eating all summer long. + drinks - not cheap, but definitely hits the mark on quality so no complaints there. + service - our server was not too keen on checking up on our drinks, but was nevertheless very friendly and earnest in his attempts to be helpful.",1
"Love this place! Used to come here all the time. Â I moved to SoCal and have been craving this since I moved. Can't wait to go home and get me some of this! The lamb plate is the best. Â The red sauce is spicy, but is soo good.",1
I'll keep it simple... Service - Poor Food - Uninteresting Value - Way over priced Sad thing is that I had bookmarked the restaurant almost 6 months prior. Heard lots of great reviews but fell way short of expectations. Next.,1
"I went here on Saturday around 1pm with my usual brunch buddy and SO. Â I have heard mixed reviews about Cookshop which was lukewarm at best. Â I haven't had the pleasure of trying its sister restaurant, Five Points but figure Cookshop would offer a fine meal given the rave reviews Five Points gets on Chowhound. We arrived 30 minutes earlier than our 1:30pm reservation and was promptly seated. Â The restaurant was packed and the bar area had a lot of ppl looming around. Â We were immediately greeted by our server who offered us water and took our drink orders. Â  I have been on a French Toast rage of late so I ordered their French Toast with caramel maple syrup. Â My SO ordered the duck confit salad and my friend ordered the scrambled eggs on an english muffin. Â We also ordered a side of string fries. Â  My friend ordered a bloody mary and my SO and I ordered regular coffee. Â I'm not sure if I was needing a caffeine fix but I found the coffee to be quite delish and my SO coincidentally agreed with me. Â Most times, the coffee served at a lot of places tastes blah. Â My friend wasn't so impressed with her bloody Mary and found it to be a bit bland. My French toast was lovely! Â The French toast was both soft and crisp soaked in the maple caramel syrup. Â I usually don't use a lot of syrup because I find it too sweet but, the syrup was just right. Â My SO's duck confit salad was very delightful with the duck leg very tender and juicy. Â My friend's scrambled eggs on an English muffin was prepared very well with the eggs very light and fluffy. Â She declared Cookshop to be her new ""go to"" brunch spot! We followed our big brunch meal with an order of flan and cappuchino's. Â The flan is the richest any of us has ever recalled tasting. Â The portion was pretty impressive because the 3 of us was unable to finish it but it may have to do with 1) our big brunch meals and 2) the richness of it. Â  Our server at one point saw that my friend's Bloody Mary remained half finished and inquired about it even offering to take it off the check and replace it with something else she would like. Â We all found that quite generous of him to offer and thanked him kindly for it. I would definitely recommend Cookshop to anyone wanting to try a new brunch spot!",1
"The Black Ant, a moderately sized restaurant that has a pretty similar setup to all other Manhattan restaurants. Â The bar is right near the front of the door with perhaps seating for about 8-10 individuals. Â The tables and chairs are pretty close together but not as outrageous as some restaurants where you are practically shoulder to shoulder with the other table. Â Overall, the vibe in here is pretty good and I would say a nice place to bring a date for sure. If you get here early enough they do have happy hour which is an amazing deal. Â Certainly a great way to get to try many of their dishes at a more reasonable price compared to their regular dinner menu. Â  For happy hour we were able to try the una con todo, taco de suadero, the chips and guac, sopesitos, and the costilla en chicilo. Â The waitress was attentive, the kitchen was fast, and the food was very, very good. Â The una con todo is as the name would imply a little bit of everything. Â It would be great to go along with a beer because it's a little box of deep fried goodies, I particularly enjoyed the deep fried cheese which was a lot like deep fried cheese curds. Â The taco de suadero was awesome, the meat was perfectly seasoned, very well cooked, and I could not find any faults with it. Â The chips and guac was awesome, mostly because they made their own chips and they were nice and thick and crunchy. Â The sopesito was probably the weakest dish we had out of the bunch because the flavors just weren't there and the corn boat had more of a styrofoam like consistency which was a bit off putting. Â Finally with my gut busting, we ordered a full entree. Â The costilla en chicilo was alright, could have been more flavorful but it was perfectly cooked and the sunchoke puree was really good. Â The short ribs were as you would want, fork tender. All in all, I would say definitely a restaurant I want to be coming back to because the food was so good.",1
"Don't bother getting a slice which will cost you an exorbitant 5 bucks. Just get the whole pie and call it a day. The pizza is GOOD! Tastes fresh and delicious! Loyal patrons will come here no matter how long the line, how high the price.....reviewing this place almost seems pointless......yummy stuff! Grimaldi's still has the #1 spot in my heart.",1
"Maysville has been on my to-do list for some time now, and I finally had the chance to check it out last Sunday. We sat at the bar for drinks, and ordered a few dishes to share: Brussels Sprouts: So crispy and flavorful, a combination you'll just never get right on your own. Every so often you get a surprise crunch from a piece of pig ear or apple which is nice. Crispy Grits: They cut the grits into cubes, fried, and topped with ham/prosciutto. I'm usually not a huge fan of grits due to the normal preparation/texture, but who can complain about little fried cubes of delicious creamy grits? Bread Pudding: Chocolate bread pudding with graham cracker ice cream and torched marshmallows. On its own the bread pudding is good, but this combination is just ridiculous. As for drinks, the whiskey/rye/scotch selection here is top notch. I won't pretend to know the first thing about scotch, but I tried several cocktails which were all spot on. The Manhattan was SO well made, so much so that I've officially decided to exclusively drink them through the rest of the fall and winter. Outside of the food and drink, I really dig the decor. It's nothing fancy or showy, but the attention to detail and overall classiness really creates a great environment for catch-up drinks or a sit-down meal.",1
"My first 5 star review! Pio Pio popped my Peruvian Cuisine ""cherry""! Â We had the Papa Rellena and Matador Combo. The Papa Rellena was amazing! Deep fried mashed potato stuffed with meat! How could you go wrong!? There was even some olives (with pits) that added an interesting flavor and pleasantly threw me off a bit. Definitely a great starter! The Matador Combo was just nothing short of awesome! Â From the unbelievably savory, moist and perfectly seasoned chicken (with the spicy creamy green sauce or as Yelpers refer to as ""Crack"" sauce) to the delicious fried plantains with interesting ""lemony"" sauce to the rice & beans and lastly the crispy french fries with bright, bright red Peruvian version of a hot dog. Just phenomenal food at a great price, especially Â when considering that this restaurant is located in an affluent area of the Upper West Side. 5 Stars for sure!",1
"I have been trying all of the local pizza places in the NYC area and we decided to come to the original grimaldi's in brooklyn. Â We came on a friday night around 7 pm after walking around the brooklyn promenade and walked right into the restaurant without a wait. Â Was pleasantly surprised there was no wait. Had a white pizza and it was pretty good. Â The oven seemed a little uneven because half of the pizza was somewhat burnt. Â Overall, the pizza was pretty good, very thin crust and tasty.",1
Delicious burgers and amazing service! The truffle burger was juicy and delicious and the fries were crunchy! It's ByO so it turns out to be super cheap. Only downside is they don't have dessert,1
"Sakagura turned me away a few years ago, when we all showed up in shorts and t-shirts. Â Perhaps something was lost in translation, because this time the place certainly seemed casual enough. Fast forward to an evening with a bunch of Japanese people, and we had a great time. Â Ordered one bottle of sake and got another one on the house. Â All sorts of random japanese dishes that I didn't understand that weren't on the english menu. Â Thank god for japanese speakers. Atmosphere is great. Â Love this place. Â It's in a pointless neighborhood, which means the opportunities to go here are fairly minimal, but it's possibly even worth a ride on the green line..",1
"Oh man.. I can't tell you how many times I waited in line for at least an hour to eat ramen at this place. They don't take reservations and it's insanely popular, especially during the dinner rush so make sure you have lots of time if you plan on eating here. I will tell you one thing, though: it's totally worth the wait. The only ails I have about this place is the price, it's about $15 for a bowl of ramen, then factor in $2 toppings, totaling about $17-20 for one person! I think that's kind of stretching it.. but it is New York.. and it is very delicious.. so I guess I can see where they're going with this, but still! I also really appreciate their vegetarian ramen option, Wasabi Shoyu Ramen. Often times, it's hard to find dishes that don't include meat, so kuddos to them for remembering to include it. I also really like that they update their dessert menu often, it says that they're creative and not afraid to be adventurous and take risks.",1
"I'm not a fan of fried chicken at all. So, when my mom said she wanted to go to Peaches HotHouse while she was visiting, I was skeptical. I mean it's chicken doesn't it all taste about the same? Wrong, so wrong. For starters we ordered the giant iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon. Before it was brought to our table my thoughts were... salad wedge so like they cut a head of lettuce in half... I just didn't understand. When I got it and ate it I understood, the blue cheese was so good and the salad was just right, very crisp and a great start to our meal. I recommend ordering it as a starter. For entrees I got the crispy fried jumbo shrimp, I couldn't decide what side I wanted so I got the mac and cheese as well as the potato salad (I ended up taking them both home because I was too full). The shrimp was awesome, spicy, but not too spicy and they removed the top shell part, I cannot stand it when restaurants don't do that, it came with chipotle mayo for me to dip the shrimp in, yumm. I also had a slice of bread that I didn't end up eating I took it home, corn bread that was so moist and full of flavor and pickles, I love pickles. My sides that I just took a quick taste of were good too. Very creamy mac and cheese and the bacon potato salad was down right awesome. My mom ordered the hot chicken plate, as I said before I'm not a big fried chicken person and bones in chicken freak me out. Well my mom forced me to try some and let me tell you it was the best fried chicken that I have ever had. She got a side of grits and she said that they were awesome as well. Overall it was well worth the 20 minute walk from my apartment to come here and there is no question in mind, I will be back again. On another note I'm not sure why everyone is saying the service is so rude, when we went our waiter was awesome and very attentive, a bit awkward but he did his job well. It also wasn't super busy when I went so hey who knows maybe there just aren't enough waiters to go around during the busy hours.",1
Amazing brunch menu. Def plan on going back if I'm around the area.,1
"Terrible experience from beginning to end. Not worth it. Go elsewhere. First of all, I would just like to say that I do not give out 1 star reviews easily. It takes a lot for me to want to give a place the lowest rating but Alta is nothing if not deserving of this. I had reservations with my girlfriend on a Friday night. They told me I had to call on the day of the reservation between the strict hours of 11AM-3PM to confirm my reservation. Otherwise, it would be given away. Most places will call you but Alta appears to be too good for that. Rather, the onus is on you, the customer. I should have immediately been turned away by this level of pretentiousness but nevertheless I pressed on and confirmed my reservation after being put on hold for 5 minutes while the incompetent hostess tries to find the reservation. Cash ad Amex only? It's 2012. This place is very difficult to find. It looks just like any other house around the area. In fact, everyone we saw that walked by was confused as to whether this was indeed Alta. Many of them had walked a few times around this block and missed it. Would it hurt this place to out up a sign? Once we found the place and got seated at our table, they managed to seat us right next to a trash can near the waiter station. This did not make for a pleasant dining experience. Our waitress was also perhaps the most stoic person ever. She came by and abruptly asked for our drink orders and dashed away. No greeting or welcome. I guess manners aren't needed when you work at Alta. The cocktails we ordered were $13 each but tasted like they were $3. I had the floridita which is basically just a screwdriver and the gf had the Ewa which didn't taste that great either. Our food was brought out and it suffices to say that it was a huge disappointment. Fried goat cheese - it's just goat cheese with honey. The lavender doesn't add much. Such a disappointment after all I had heard about this dish. Bacon wrapped olives - possibly the best dish of the night although you'd have to be retarded to screw up bacon and canned olives. Lamb meatballs - lots of cumin, nothing really that special. The egg yolk doesn't really add much and is mostly just for show. 4 tiny ass meatballs. Brussel sprouts - what is the big deal? Fried Brussel sprouts? I have had way better. The creme fraiche was interesting but the apple slices were sparse and didn't add to the dish. Avocado Relleno - tiny tiny half of an avocado with a spoonful of crab. The entire thing was about the size of 2 cherry tomatoes. Bland and flavorless. Stay away from this dish. The waitress would intermittently come and gather the empty plates but would never make eye contact, smile, or even have the decency to ask how we're doing. A couple of times she smacked into my elbow with one of the large plates and didn't even apologize, just walked away. Seriously one of the worse waitresses I have ever had. She was a short haired white lady, middle aged, stocky and overweighed. She never introduced herself so I don't know her name. Stay away from her. The entire meal was $100 for two drinks and 5 microscopically tiny, generic and unoriginal tapas. It makes me so angry to know that I could have had such a better experience at so many other places at a fraction of the price. I honestly cannot understand how this place got such great reviews because the dining experience we had was piss poor at best. In fact, we left this place to go to Las Ramblas which was infinitely better! I will never come to Alta again and I suggest you all do the same. The ambience is nice but nothing special for NYC. Some places in this city get so big on their reputation that they think they can't fail and start cutting corners. Alta is clearly one of these places and it is extremely offensive to me as a customer that I am taken for granted. I will surely be taking my money elsewhere from now on. Shame on you Alta for thinking that you are beyond reproach.",1
"$2 for 10 dumplings....... also $2 for a sesame duck sandwich is pretty amazing. Also if you want to do these at home, they sell a bag (A BAG) of 100 dumplings for $10! How do you make dumplings at home? Boiling water - 10 mins - done. I bought 2 bags of dumplings and had about 10 people over. Boom! Cheap party!",1
"Portions are HUGE! Even when they say ""Small"" I loved the skillet jalapeno bacon cornbread. The buttermilk biscuits were also fluffy and delicious. Pig tails means... PIG TAILS! Tastes kind of like ribs, but with softer bone. Fried green tomatoes with duck confit and frisee salad - YUMMMMMMM Mac and cheese in a skillet... wow... blown away. Leaving really full and happy!",1
"We give this place 2 1/2 stars and very disappointed to do so as we had high expectations. Â We got the beef noodle soup, beef and tripe noodle soup and the fried dumplings. Â The fried dumplings were the best part of the meal and the filling was actually flavorful so no dipping sauce was needed, definitely better than vanessa's dumpling house. Â The hand drawn noodles themselves were very good and fresh, however the soup/broth was not very flavorful. Â We wish we could just buy the noodles dry to make our own meal. Â The soup had some beef, tripe and bok choy but the broth tasted just like beef stock without additional flavoring. Â Very unimpressive, will probably not return",1
"It was one of those days where I could take my (baby) dog into work, and was so gorgeous outside, didn't want to go home after. I wanted to sit, and enjoy a meal, and needed a restaurant that would allow my dog to sit and beg, while I ate. Not many NYC restaurants allow dogs while I sit and eat outside; this one did, so that's where I went. To start off, they were hella friendly with my Popstar, and like any pet-parent, I LOVED it. If you welcome my dog, that's a A++ for me. Â They offered him water, and treats. Unfortunately, he's the type of dog where if you're eating human food, he wants human food, so he didn't take the treats. On to the meal, my boyfriend and I shared a macaroni appetizer (smoked Â Gouda with bacon) Â that I'd absolutely go back for. They used chopped bacon, rather than bacon bits which I prefer. Granted, I also like the bacon within the macaroni, not just sprinkled on top, the macaroni was good. My boyfriend ordered the classic Cafeteria burger, which he thought was average. It was okay, nothing to write home about. I wanted seafood, and because we were there at 5:30pm, I couldn't order the crab cakes I'd set out for, so instead ordered the Prince Edward Island Mussels... Not a fan. While the white wine the mussels were submerge in was pretty good, the mussels were small, and some shells were closed (I absolute hate that). Some of the mussels were dry, and the wine sauce didn't help to make them any juicier. I finished the bowl, and scarfed down the bread soaked in the white wine sauce! The Yucca fries that came with them were pretty tasteless (though my boyfriend found them spicy) and I didn't finish half of them. Â The dessert menu looked pretty appeasing, but I thought I'd save that for next time. So why the four stars? I really DID enjoy the macaroni (restaurants around the city seem to be getting it TOGETHER with the macaroni! LOL), the staff was super friendly as I stated before, if you're nice to my Popstar, A++), and I'm more than ""amped"" to go back and try something else. So 4 stars because ""Yay! I'm a fan."" However, the review may change after my second visit.",1
"It is to be expected that a place in this locale would be touristy, and indeed it is. However, the vendors here put other food courts to shame. Can't make it to Smorgasburg? Want to try some of the most popular businesses in the city, in one place? Hudson Eats might be the choice for you. Num Pang, Black Seed, Mighty Quinn, and Dos Toros are all here, churning out the same quality product you get at their other locations. There is plenty of seating, whether at a booth, table, or high-top, and it is all super clean. Unlike a traditional mall food court, this is a bit more high end, but not unaffordable. I'm a fan despite the slack-jawed clientele, simply because I can get a bagel, some brisket, a cupcake, and a hoisin meatball sandwich without having to travel to four separate brick-and-mortar joints. Viva good eats and gluttony.",1
"food was definitely delicious. was not the best fried chicken so a little dissapointed with that, but the mac and cheese was incredible, a long with the busciut. can't wait to come back to try more!",1
"Definitely one of the best pizza I ever had, this pizza can compete with the ones I had In Italy, even in Naples. True, the wait is really loooooooooooooooooong, very, very long, so just be aware of that, be patient and you'll have a great pizza. Also, not expensive at all, $5 a regular slice.",1
Luzzo's- what happened? Â You were once my #1 pizza place in the city. Â Friend straight off the boat from Italy- you are her favorite place. The last pizza wasn't at all the same or even good. Â  Sadly. Â  :(,1
"The calamari is amazingly fresh and crispy! I love the primm cocktail because it's fruity and sweet! I loved my skirt steak in my tacos but not really everything else too spicy for me! My bf had the kangaroo burger and his dish was clean! The server, Jon was super nice and helpful which made the experience amazing! I would go here again and recommend this place! Don't worry the kangaroos are not caught in queens!",1
Loved their vegetarian cous cous - fresh and flavorful but $8!,1
"Went to enjoy the downstairs music. Not bad, decent dj. Great dance and 90s mix. Would go back",1
"Seriously- the best Japanese NY style place in town. In NY! Love the spicy miso ramen. They are always friendly, happy to be at work, and loving life! Good food- good vibes. stop by and enjoy the food!",1
"I came here for dinner almost a year ago so my review may not be indicative to the restaurant's standards now. Â All I remember was the duck I ordered was a little too rare. Â Everything else was fine, but alas, not exemplary to remember but considering going back to check it out again.",1
"Hmmmm... five tacos... *mouth waters* I happened to be chatting with a friend when she brought up Five Tacos as being a go to place for tacos. Now I just happened to be in the area that afternoon so I just had to check this spot out. When you walk in there's a big wooden table and bar like seating where you order. The place is rather small so don't expect to find seating for a group of 10, especially if there are already other patrons inside. The menu is very SIMPLE you're either getting a taco, quesadilla, burrito, or a side. This is real authentic Mexican food prepared at the spot so you're guaranteed anything you do get will be delicious and more importantly, FRESH. Now I decided to be a bit adventurous (or as adventurous as I can be while on a diet) and order a veggie taco with a side of black bean salsa & chips. You may be asking yourself who orders ONLY one taco... well I do... errr... or did. Reason being that the portions here are HUGE. All I needed was one taco and a side to get my fill. Before I received my taco my order of chips and black bean salsa was ready. The black bean salsa can best be described as cooked beans (not hard) tossed in with pico de gallo. I absolutely loved the salsa, but the chips were a little too salty for my liking. #dietproblems The veggie taco was a corn tortilla filled with butternut squash, roasted red peppers, corn salsa, jicama, and cheese sprinkled on top. Being that I love a lot of spice in my life I added a couple of sauces to my taco. I was cautious at first and tried a little of the Tequila chipotle mayo, which was tasty with just the right amount of kick to it. You could really taste the chipotle. If you don't like spice this is your best choice. Then it was on to the big boys... I tried the habanero jerk & devil sauce. Both sauces were extremely spicy, but were just the right amount of kick my taco needed. They added spice without overwhelming my palette or taking over all the wonderful flavors within my taco. As I type this review I'm already thinking of all the things I want to try next on their menu. If you're ever in the St. Marks area and in the mood for Mexican then Five Tacos is definitely worth checking out.",1
Had special of day. Grilled chicken cheese Â red onion avocado arugula panini. Awesome crunchy texture. Came two adults and two kiddies very accommodating and helpful. Only one high chair in the place so they may need to buy more. Good thing I always have a space saver high chair in my trunk. Then we had crepes. Nutella banana and apple cinnamon. Nutella banana was really really good better than apple cinnamon but nutella always beats anything if you ask me. Next time I want to come back without the kiddies to savor the food a little better. Nice staff. Cute place. Thank goodness I don't have to cool tonight ;),1
"Everyone knows I love a good brunch and I especially love a good benedict at said brunch. Thankfully, I got both at Jane. My mouth watered just reading the menu and then even more so as our waiter described two benedict specials (did someone say shortrib??). When it came down to it, I went with the Jane and I was not one bit disappointed. Coupled with the crispy potatoes on the side, I was more than satisfied. I even snuck in a few bites of the thick and decadent french toast that was perfect if you are craving something sweeter. It wasn't the quickest service as the place was packed, but I was too busy catching up with old friends to really care. This place won't blow you out of the water but is a safe bet for a cozy brunch around the area.",1
"My friend let me choose a place to eat last weekend so I decided to come here because I read on a article how some chef's enjoy eating here plus I look over there website and it sound very promising. I got there first and lucky we got a reservation because this place was getting pack and they were just open too. I sat down and order myself a beer and a cold sake to drink while looking over the menu. i knew exactly what I wanted already from reading the menu online but i needed to pass some time so I look over it anyway. The hotpot was the highlight so i needed to choose that plus they have collargen inside. How can you pass that up?? My friend finally show up so she look over the menu and we decided on the hotpot plus a few items to start with. We order the yellowtails sashimi, foie gras sushi and something else but i can't really remember it. yellowtail-it look nice but the fish wasn't fresh enough for me plus they put fried shallot or garlic on it so it took the taste away from the fish foie gras-sound delicious but when it came, it was ok....surprisely enough i was quite disappointed hot pot-it was hugh and there were tons of veggie it in so my friend like it alot. I wanted to try their dumpling but i only found like 2 pieces in the whole hot pot. It was ok, nothing special. The broth itself was ok, a little toward the bland side. We also got the ramen noodle for extra $4 and guess what?? it was dried noodle that you get from opening a noodle package and If i knew that in the first place then FORGET it. It wasn't even special In the end, I walked away buzz and quite disappointed. Next time I am not going read a stupid article about some stupid chef's who like it. YES he is white so he think anything EXOTIC will taste good. I should just follow my own path, at least i can't blame anyone afterward lol",1
"5 star breakdown: Location (.5 stars) + Price (1.5 stars) + Service (.6 stars) + BBQ Pork (2 Stars) = 4.6 stars I have gone around the city and tried almost all the vietnamese/cambodian sandwiches in the city and I always end up coming back here. Â They aren't the perfect sandwich, but pretty damn near close. Â The BBQ pork is sweet and crispy, the vegetables are crisp, and the price, ridiculously cheap. I've been a fan of their sandwiches ever since the owner first started making sandwiches in a single toaster over, in a deli which was no bigger than two golf carts put together, over by east broadway. Â  Since then, the quality of their sandwiches have dropped slightly, which was disappointing, but the quickness of service and ease of location balances this factor.",1
"After one too many drinks at Shoolbreds (per the usual) my group and I headed Southwest to The Smith for some dinner. Being the sister restaurant to Jane, which I found only so-so, my expectations were rather low. We were seated right away by a less than interested hostess. After reviewing the menu I settled on the mac and cheese appetizer (to share with Tal H.) and the slow roasted pork sandwich. I chose the mac and cheese because I can't help myself and went with the pork sandwich because the menu boasted shaved cauliflower on it, and I love cauliflower. The mac and cheese was good, homemade and a hearty portion, which I always enjoy, and makes sharing more fun. The sandwich was decent. I could only eat half, but took the rest home for lunch the next day. It did have cauliflower like it promised, and that was tasty, but too much arugula made the sandwich messy and I had to pull a lot of it out. The pork was not memorable, but overall I was satisfied. I will give the Smith props for its decor. It's an industrial-esque space, with subway tiles walls, exposed bulbs and tiny tiles on the floor. Water (both sparkling and flat) is placed on each table upon arrival in empty booze bottles without labels. Nice touch. The space was cold and cozy all at one time. Cold because of the tile and metal used to decorate and cozy because the tables were so close together and it was pretty packed. Frankly, it was a little expensive and everyone hyped it up for something that's really no big deal. Solid for the area, I would return again if Apiary is closed. High five for the photobooth downstairs, however it was out of order. hungrychildinthecity.worâ€¦",1
"K-town has always been one of my favorite places to visit. It's a lot more hustling and bustling these days than it used to be. I guess people are discovering their love for Korean food! That being said... the restaurants have gone up quite a bit in prices. However, Woorijip is one of the more reasonable establishments around. Inside this little nook is a bright, clean place with a surprisingly decent amount of seating. Woorijip cranks out tons of delicious food daily. They have a pretty big buffet with both cold/hot choices. What's delicious: bulgogi (shredded korean beef), kimbap, kimchi (fermented cabbage... I know sounds gross but it's good. Spicy good.), japchae (glass noodles) and more! They have some more familiar items like fried rice and garlic chicken. They have trays and containers that are weighed by the lb. (I think $7.99/lb) You can slide down the buffet and beyond that they sell individual containers with food as well... If you're in a rush or more of a on-the-go type. It's great because if you're not familiar with the Korean cuisine, you can try a bunch of things and for a great price. Total win. Yeah for being adventurous! I'm not sure if they weight the food factoring out the tray and container... but I hope they do cause that wouldn't be cool. But my meal (as you can tell by my picture I was starving...) was a little less than $10. Not too shabby! And that was with a water bottle too. ($1) It seriously doesn't get any better than this. Can't wait to come back. If you're a beginner to Korean food, come to Woorijip. You won't be disappointed.",1
"I've been wanting to go to Penelope for about two years now and finally got the chance to get brunch there last week. The wait is usually horrendous, but I was able to put my name down, go to the gym, and then come back 1.5 hours later and not have to wait. I ordered the Nutella French Toast -- highly recommended! Then again, how can you go wrong w/ Nutella? My cousin ordered the Penny Egg Sandwich on a croissant, which I thought was also very tasty (hint: the pesto is the highlight). If you don't mind waiting 1+ hours or if you have somewhere in the neighborhood where you can kill time, I would definitely recommend this place! -L.",1
"this is a straightforward review: Grimaldi's has good pizza but is nothing spectacular. that being said, would I recommend you to try it? Yes - it has a lot of publicity and is regarded by many as one of the best pizza places. Would I go there again? Probably not because it is not worth the wait.",1
"Finally got a chance to stop by this wonderful little gem hidden among the ethnic bazaar of the Essex Street Market. Â I can't even count how many times I've tried to catch this place open and failed. When I got the chance to get some spinach pie from this wonderful woman, I was NOT disappointed. Now, you see, spinach pie isn't exactly something I would normally eat, because it just doesn't sound pleasant, but I freakin' loved it this time. It was a bit pricey for a slice of spinach pie, but you pay for quality, and it never hurts to support small businesses. I have to go back and grab some Baklava soon.",1
Real good food! Â Especially the famous corn/elote and the meat+rice+bean dishes! I also really enjoyed their tostones that came with a really delicious dipping sauce. I do have to say though...this restaurant needs just a little more space...lol...it can turn you claustrophobic! haha The restaurant is close to soho so you can work off all them calories while shopping there! :),1
"Would probably give this place 4.5 starts. It is such a beautiful space, 2 floors and quite big on the inside! Â Came here for a bday dinner-made my reservations 1 month prior and could only get a 530 reservation. Â  The staff was very nice and attentive, always there when we needed them. Â My family and I got a lot of different dishes. To start we had the fresh ricotta cheese, beets, fluke crudo and the orrichette. Â Loved all the starts albeit some where a bit small on the portions (beets esp) but everything was fresh and extremely flavorful. Â  For our dinners many got fish options-I tried them all and they were perfectly cooked, buttery treats. I had the octopus which I found a bit disappointing--very small portion and not the best octopus ive ever had. Â The 2 others got the seafood pasta which had to be my favorite dish of the night. Â Had some sides--broccoli rabe, crispy potatoes and brussel sprouts. Found all to be good but the brussels were a bit salty because they overloaded them with cheese. For dessert we had the cranberry torte, olive oil cake and the chocolate pudding. Hands down the chocolate pudding won the dessert race. I found the other 2 to be a bit uninspiring. Â They did however comp me a dessert because they knew it was my bday. Very nice. Overall had a great experience at this restaurant!",1
"A cool Aussie spot in Soho. It is tiny but has a good vibe but is really limited in what it can offer due to the ridiculously small kitchen. In true Aussie fashion, the food is a bit amateurish and casual, but not a bad spot for a quick meal.",1
"I love empanadas and this place gets it right. Â Lots of choices of yummy fillings inside a flaky-crunchy shell. Â You can even try to be healthier by choosing the whole wheat shell, but you can tell it's the healthier version when you eat it. Â Also I think the whole wheat one is smaller so just go for the classic corn empanadas.",1
Very average Thai food. Â I had a summer roll and chicken pho. Â The chicken was tender but the broth was generic. Â The portions were large but I wouldn't come back.,1
"Pricey soho joint, the only good meal/deal here is the burger or the chicken sandwich on the lunch menu. Matzo ball soup is OK. Salads are tablespoon portions and cost full-price. Communal seating, which makes your ass sweaty in the summer. Arrive after 12pm and expect an hour wait.",1
"Macarons happen to be one of my weaknesses. With that said, how could I say no to Laduree when I'm in the area? It is on the expensive side but it's worth every penny. Every time I walk in, my knees buckle and I'm suddenly engrossed in all the flavors available for purchase. My all-time favorite flavor is pistachio. All of the flavors are wonderful but I tend to stick to pistachio for reasons I really can't explain. I haven't been here in almost a year and my taste buds seem in search of macarons. Sounds like a need to make a trip to the UES and get lost in flavor heaven again.",1
"Came here for my birthday and it was amazing! I had the Tuna belly tartar (not on menu) - delicious, very fatty, fish was very fresh. Ricci e Cavolfiore: sea urchin never fails, but paired with the cauliflower panna cotta, splash of lemon and parmesan, gives a surprising explosion of perfectly blended flavors. Trofie Nero - squid ink pasta was very good. A nice mix of prawn, scallops, some other seafood with al dente pasta. Bouillabaisse - the broth was delicious, large servings of seafood with a few pieces of buttered toast. Astice - lobster is difficult to screw up, but their butter poached nova scotia lobster was perfectly medium cooked. It is hard to describe. Definitely recommend this. You get a large lobster tail with some claw meat. Service was amazing. Our waiter was very soft spoken and helpful when we asked for recommendations. He was passionate and animated when we asked him to describe some of the dishes, so we continued to ask for recommendations and descriptions of the dishes throughout the night. He never got annoyed and always happily answered our questions. I arrived with 3 large cakes that they gladly refrigerated for me at no cost. I also forgot my phone at the table and they chased me down to return my phone (I gave them a $5 tip for their efforts).",1
"So I've been searching for authentic Puerto Rican food in this neck of the woods (Chelsea/anything not in El Barrio) for about 2.5 years and....I've finally found it! When I say authentic, I'm talking about the kind that I get when I sit down for dinner at my Wela's table. Â Like really authentic. I mean the food was seasoned perfectly. The portions left you completely satisfied and the service made me feel like I was at home. Not fancy, but warm and inviting nonetheless. They let their food do the talking. My meal: Steak and onions White rice and red beans Maduros Pepsi Rating: Absolutely mouthwatering I'm a fan. As soon as I left I called my family and told them I finally found it! This was all Yelp too. Great work to all the previous reviewers who recognized the quality of this establishment. Que rico!",1
"The original Meatball Shop (other locations now include West Village and Williamsburg), is a definite go-to spot if in the neighborhood. Everything is great, and try whatever they have on special. Finish with a homemade ice cream sandwich. My only request is that they delivered, or at least took phone orders! You can do take out, but you have to go there and pay first, then wait 20 minutes for your food.",1
"I was actually expecting a lot and I wasn't disappointed! Everything everyone wrote was right on the money --- dark atmosphere, friendly waiters that weren't pretentious at all, and delicious food! We had: - dungeness crab for appetizers (SO GOOD!) - hanger steak - wild boar (SO JUICY & FLAVORFUL!) - risotto (YUMMM!! flavorful and cheesy-ish!) - toffee pudding (AMAZING! and it's NOT pudding, more like a toffee version of molten lava cake) I would say that ALL of them wowed me with the exception of the hanger steak. It was a little salty for me & my husband's taste. But OH EM GEE, the rest were FANTASTIC! I didn't even mind how they were teeny tiny portions. The powerful flavors made it seem like you were eating a LOT. It was the first time I could actually tell that certain flavors complemented each other. Like the toffee ""pudding"" came with a warm pear and ginger ice cream scoop, and although I found that a bit odd -- they tasted BETTER when you had them TOGETHER. One bite of each made the flavors soar! Â I'm very excited, if you can't tell. The price was just right. I was celebrating that night, so for appetizers, dinner & dessert + drinks for 2 was less than $150. I also made reservations about 45 minutes before we came in, so that was great as well! Bravo, Perilla! I love it.",1
I love coming here for the atmosphere. The food is okay. I've had most of the items on menu.,1
"Great atmosphere: exposed brick, small space, open kitchen right behind the bar, and terrific music. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and the huevos rancheros brunch was both reasonably priced and delicious. Our waiter suggested that we come back for dinner, which is apparently even better. Bar is wine/beer only - ask for a Michelada (beer/hot sauce/lime/salt)! Went back for dinner and was not quiteeee as impressed, though it was still pretty tasty. It's pricier in the PM, but it has an intimate vibe that would make it a good date spot.",1
"Just went to this place for the first time last night and loved it. Its pretty small and was packed on a tuesday night (no reservations so come in prepared for a wait.) But it was worth it! Had a good cocktail and wine list, and all the food was fresh and tasty. As a vegetarian (no fish either) I found plenty to eat. Loved the chopped vegetable quinoa salad, and the house made ricotta app was amazing too. Nice servers. Definitely a hipster spot, but for the decent prices and good sized, yummy portions, I definitely recommend it!",1
"While walking into the establishment I see a butcher table the middle and an extensive aisle of beer - I knew then that they mean business. Sat at the bar with a friend while watching Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 ... We decided to split the Lamb Belly. The Lamb Belly was the fattiest thing ever .. we didn't finish it, but it was delicious. A very laid back place with friendly service. The restroom has very cute decor and it was super clean. Meat and beer lovers should try this place out.",1
"Mushroom tempura special, and their sobas are one of the weirdest (in a good way) and nicest things to eat in j-village. Nice restaurant!",1
"Some of the dishes were really good, but not all of them... The music is a little weird so don't go here for a relaxed dinner or a romantic date :) I would recommend the Nacho Libre.",1
"Gets points for being the last thing open after we staggered out of the climbing gym at almost 10pm. We wolfed down hamburgers and beer, which were quite fancy considering we were all sweaty and gross. The hamburger is a good piece of meat, well cooked, served on a brioche bun that was notably good. Hipstery / faux-retro interior. Regulars at the bar. We might come back for brunch, it seems like people speak well of it, but I cannot feel super enthusiastic about coming back here regularly after workouts. If they had a more varied and affordable menu I would be all over it.",1
"Many people have suggested Ippudo as part of my diet in New York so I decided I had to try it. Instead of going to the original one and waiting for hours by myself, I decided just to trek to the one on the Westside. I walked in and there was almost no one there. Thank god. I sat down at this U shaped bar and was served immediately. I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with some added pork belly (because well I'm on vacation right?). Well the pork belly wasn't the best part. The outside park were well cooked and juicy, but the insides were a bit dry and not the best. The other parts of it though were amazing. Overall, good ramen. Would come again for the other items on the menu.",1
"Stopped by today for lunch. I have had this place bookmarked for a long time and really wanted to try it. A lot of friends recommended me this place for lunch and the reviews were great. I finally had time to check this place out! I got here around 12:15pm for lunch and the place is a hole in the wall. Really small, no wonder why there would be such long lines. Well lucky me when I got there I only had about 4 people ahead of me (good thing I was able to wait inside due to the cold). I waited only 10 minutes max to get my food. I got the small roast pork dish which cost only $3.75 and they loaded it up with meat! There's no seating there, so I brought mine to go and ate it at home. The meat was good and for $3.75 it was awesome! I've had this dish at other places which tasted better but this is well worth it. Enjoy!",1
"Huge open beer hall. Â We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed with a fun crowd of all types. Â We didn't have anything to eat, but the sausages looked good. Â Good beer selection and good bartenders taking care of everyone.",1
"I liked this place a lot! Came here on a Wednesday night around 5:30, a table of four..no problem getting in. The decor is pretty funny, super outdated and kind of messy. It has charm though. The food: I had the polish platter for my entree (almost all of us ordered this), everything was pretty good. I had my pierogies boiled, loved the sauerkraut ones. The piece of stuffed cabbage was massive, and one of my favorite things on the plate. Kielbasa was awesome. Mashed potatoes, meh..I've had way better. The stew-sauerkraut stuff, also really good. $11.25 can't beat it. Highly recommend the broscht with vegetable, super cheap and filling! I probably could have that as a meal. The strawberry & cheese blintze, to die for! So so good, like a toaster strudel and crepes had a baby yummmm. Service could have been better, he barely checked up on us, I had to physically go get him a few times to ask for things, and the place was not busy. Otherwise, he was nice.",1
"Oh man...I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and I was finally able to snag a seat with a friend late on a Wednesday night. Let me tell you, it's worth the wait. All the food from start to finish was absolutely delicious. From the charred bread Â at the beginning to the complimentary flan-like dessert (forgot the name). We started with the Greek salad and the veggie chips. The salad was so fresh and came with juicy tomatoes and some great feta. The veggie chips were thin slices of eggplant and zucchini fried lightly and served with a tzatziki dipping sauce. These were addicting and I would get them every time! For our entrees, I got the octopus which was supposed to be an appetizer but totally enough to be an entree. It was perfectly charred. It was definitely some of the best octopus I've had in NYC and I usually get it every time I see it on a menu, so that's saying something. My friend got the swordfish steak which was also cooked to perfection. The portions here are enormous!! You don't see that too often around here especially with the consistent quality of the food. I will be back to conquer the rest of the menu!",1
"Had the $30 prefix lunch. My boyfriend had the endive salad & the chicken, I had the foie gras & moules frites. All very good!! Cocktails also very yummy. We had the old fashioned and the reluctant debutante. Not sure if it was just the company, but all in all a great lunch. Def want to go back and see how they do dinner here.",1
You can feel harlem history as soon as you walk into this place. Â The food is tasty and the service is great. Â Each room has a different feel to it. Â The price is very reasonable considering it's now a popular tourist attraction.,1
"We ordered dozen tapas and each single one was unique simple and delicious. Sangria was quite good. It is a charming unpretentious room and it's always packed, so you might want to reserve in advance. Especially memorable was the kale pesto gnocchi.",1
"It's my go-to place for malaysian food in the area. The food here is standard, but there's a good variety and it's consistent. I love the roti canai and the hainanese chicken with rice, and their spicy shrimp noodle soup is good too. It's possible to have a sit-down dinner for under $15 per person including tax and tip, so prices are very reasonable too!",1
"I absolutely love this place! First let me start of by saying the generic stuff like how friendly budget this place is, it's convenient location and it's great food. Personally I don't really come here to get anything other than the pot stickers (the fried ones are better than the steamed ones, but they're both good!). But I have tried their other food. I think that one main attraction about this place is that they make the noodles in front of you. There are seats right in front of the window that they make the noodles which is cool! The noodles itself don't really taste THHATTT amazing. They taste like something that you can get anywhere else.. Oh.. and they have a language barrier which pushed it down one star. For the most part if you can't speak Chinese you'd have to point to what's on the menu and if you wanted a special request like no cilantro or less spicy that's going to be tough on you. The receipt is also in Chinese. OH!!! And they have unlimited tea :D",1
"For 4.5 stars average rating I was coming in with high expectations. Initially the seating for my party of 12 (with reservation) was on point and we were accommodated nicely. Food/Drink: I had a whiskey sour which was excellent. Pulled pork tacos were miniature but decent in taste. I've had better from Empellon Taqueria near christopher path train exit. Entrees are very tiny. I ordered the divers callop entree and I thought they messed up the order because they also have the same diver scallop app as a smaller portion listed under the entree menu. However the taste was 3.5-4 stars so that was pretty good. For dessert I had a Affogato (2 stars) which I had no idea was basically an expresso drink (not so much a dessert). I know it says expresso in the description but the rest of it does not indicate that this was the primary component of the dessert. I should be more appropriately labeled expresso shot dessert. After we got the bill the waitress did not show up for over 45 minutes. I understand that we were talking and all that but I would still expect some kind of service. Decent place to be, service had highs and lows, food was in the average range for the most part, overall avg: 3.",1
"Why is the regular size HUGE and the large size a bucket? Â Why can't you buy a portion that a regular person can actually finish? The lady behind the counter was very nice and let me try a couple sauces before ordering, but there are just way too many to actually make any sort of educated decision. Â  The fries were thick and very greasy. Â I prefer them a bit more crispy then they came out to be, so I wasn't super impressed. Â  I'm pretty sure, right now, all the oil from the fries is slowly (or quickly) killing me.",1
"We got the Israeli breakfast in pita, chicken schwarma in pita and roasted corn. My boyfriend loved the flavor in the schwarma, and wants to come back again. Roasted corn is actually on the cob with sesame seeds, and that was alright. The cashier was nice, and the place looked like a cafeteria, but nice ambiance overall. Kebobs and plates for next time!",1
"i was craving fried chicken & waffles. the plan was to make them for brunch, then i imagined the mountain of dishes and grease in my kitchen and decided to let someone else make them for me. we made a mad dash to get to buttermilk by 3pm and after every minor misadventure imaginable, we walked into buttermilk at 2:58pm. we were seated(!), albeit somewhat grudgingly. it turned out that buttermilk does not have c&w on their menu. a certain brother transposed the dish from the dinner menu to brunch, but they did have a fried pork chop & waffles! close enough... that is until we were informed that they are out of pork chops. we had bloody marys, the house-cured salmon platter, house pickles, a cheddar waffle, huntington eggs, side of bacon, and the burger. i loved my dish. what's not to love about pumpernickel bread smeared with green onion cream cheese, covered in thin slices of silky house cured salmon, and sprinkled with fried capers. that said, it's not a filling enough dish if your first meal is at 3:15pm. next time i'd only get this dish to split among a couple people as an appetizer. house pickles -- the dill spears were unimpressive and reminded of my failed batch of homemade pickles. the bread & butter chips were good. cheddar waffle -- incredible!!! huntington eggs -- perfectly poached, sitting on a delicious biscuit and smothered in creamy hollandaise. i did think the hollandaise could have used a touch more lemon juice and cayenne but nitpicking blah blah. burger -- didn't try it. my friend likes her burgers medium-well and that killed all my curiosity. she said it was at a midway point between good and excellent. bacon -- yes, please. bloody mary -- perfection. spice, body, punch. the space is bright and open. they play an upbeat pandora music mix. the best brunch experience in a loooooooooong time.",1
"We all had a great time at Ippudo. Â Of course, I had a fabulous ramen. Â We started with the pork buns and ended with green tea ice cream. The service was wonderful and it was a lot of fun seeing the chefs at work in the kitchen as there is a glass partition showing you where the magic happens. Â Best news: Â they have a counter! Â You can pop in for a pork bun fix when you're on your own, easy peasy.",1
"The best ramen in New York! (Though still not as good as what you can get in LA!) Wait: I've been to Ippudo twice - the wait was 20 minutes on a Tuesday winter night, 1 hour on a Wednesday summer night. Food: So far, I've tried the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and Akamaru Modern (both delicious and savory, even better with the boiled egg), and Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (seasoned cucumbers - very delicious). Overall: I have a few complaints: I had great service on the first visit, but (1) it was bad the second time around, when I visited in the summer. Waiters awkwardly repeatedly lingered by our table towards the end of the meal, picking up finished bowls every other minute. I understand that it's rush hour, but I was annoyed that waiters acted so clumsily, at expense of our dining experience. Try visiting outside of rush hours or during bad weather. (2) What you get for the price ($20 / bowl) is underwhelming. Not much ramen and that wonderful soft boiled egg also comes at an extra cost, in contrast to the shops in LA which are generous in toppings (egg!) and serving size. Ippudo disappointed me here.",1
"Love the rustic/wood decor and somewhat hipster feel of the place. Â Didn't like the wait but on a beautiful day in the village it's not too bad. Â They do have a small little bench outside so if you get lucky (or don't wanna wander around) it's ok. Came here for brunch on Mother's Day Sunday with a friend. Â Considering we weren't able to make it home to see our own mothers we wanted to go to a nice, homey place with the home cooked feel. Â It's more like a place my dad would run with my dad behind the stove but hey, it worked! Â I had the most perfectly poached eggs for the salmon Bennie and friend got an upscale version of shrimp and grits. Â We also got the fries (yum) and the Brussels sprouts (which were ok). Â  The place was packed with hipster looking folks and not many mothers in two but it was a fun place and would go back with friends. Â Can't wait to try to dinner.",1
"actually 3.5 - pros: good inexpensive meal, xiao long bao with pork and shrimp were great, sesame pancake was good. Â  - cons: servers are hectic and not careful enough.. we ordered sesame pancake, waited for 30 minutes, and figured out that the server didn't even tell to the cook in the kitchen.. and lastly, CASH ONLY even if we had more than $20.. Came here for Friday lunch with my friend who had studied in China for a half year. arrived here at around 12pm and we kinda worried about a long waiting, but we could get seated as we entered inside. most of the seats are big round tables for a party of 6~8ppl, so we had to share a table with a family of 5 ppl, and another mid-aged men. Food was nice, compared to its cheap price. But do not expect nice and careful waiters/waitresses.. some of them can't even speak english very well.",1
"- Waited about one hour in line to get a table (perks about going in group of 2 rather than large group - get to skip line if small tables open up) - Waited another 45 min. to get pizza after ordering (it IS fresh) - Wait wasn't justified. It WAS good, bu",1
"Saturday 8pm-ish. No wait, but there was quickly a short line after we sat down. So cheap. I know it's no longer BYOB but a bottle is like 15-20 bucks, so no worries there. The food is DELICIOUS - it all came out so fast. Everything was cooked to perfection and was fresh. My girlfriend and I split 3 entrees and an appetizer and ate it all. And despite being I was uncomfortably full, it was all worth it. We stuck with the recommendations on their chalkboard. Maybe next time we will venture out to some other things. Perfect for the vegetarian with the meat-loving significant other.",1
Eataly is a great place. The restaurants in Eataly are awesome. The pasta was definitely worth it. Eataly is a place to check out. I went there with my boyfriend to get a bite to eat. Eataly is worth checking out.,1
"There isn't a place in the world that I know of that will fulfill my fries craving like Pommes. Why? Well it's not just that the fries are made from fresh potatoes, fried perfectly, and come out greasy and delicious. The real reason is the unique sauces that come with the fries. Black truffle mayo, wasabi mayo, and rosemary garlic are some of my favorites, and some of the best dipping sauces for fries that I've ever tried.",1
Cho Dang Gol is my favorite go to Korean restaurant for non-KBBQ dishes. The restaurant claims itself to offer hand-made bean curd. 1) Spicy Galbi Jjim This is a highly recommend dish. The dish was flavorful and was savory and sweet with a hint of spiciness. The short rib was extremely tender and easily fell off the bone.The restaurant definitely did a great job braising it till the meat was soft - plus it was not filled with huge chunks of fat. The stew is also filled with rice cakes and slices of squash. 2) Haemul Cham Dubu This seafood tofu stew was extremely filling. The restaurant is very generous with the seafood. You will definitely find much more seafood in this tofu stew than the famous BCD Tofu. The broth is much more stronger and flavorful than BCD. The tofu was soft and silky. They only take reservations for weekdays. Therefore come early during the weekends or be prepared to wait in line as the lines start to build up around 630PM. The service could be better. It was spotty and the waiter was rushing us to order because there was a long waiting line for a table.,1
"Really don't understand how this place has 4 stars. I came here with 3 other people for dinner and we all unanimously found the food and ambiance to be pretty bad! Ambiance: -this was one of the loudest places I've ever dined at, we simply could not hear one another. - the table we were sitting at was in the middle of the room, a communal table with long benches which were uncomfortable and did not like the communal bench concept Food: - matzo ball soup was pretty good - couscous was awful - way too sweet and they put so much broth in it that it was served like a soup. Not made the way it is supposed to be at all - sandwich my sister had was very mediocre Service; - it was so loud that the waitress didn't hear us order dessert and instead brought us the check! Drinks: - barely any options at all for wine. we ordered a carafe of wine and it was quite frankly one of the worst wines I've had in a very long time",1
"Pros: Chasha Momo Hot sauce Cons: Sha Thukpa (made with spaghetti noodles, definitely not authentic) Chili Chicken (possibly the worst one of the lot; how can you mess fried chicken) Paratha (tasted like the pre-made frozen) You've got to know something's off when the most popular item here is the avocado salad. If you've ever been to the Himalayas (Nepal, Tibet, India) you know avocados are not native. Sorry, I'll stick to going to Jackson Heights.",1
"I don't think I even need to review this place, but my meal was so outstanding that I will anyway. Located in the basement of an office building, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. After walking down the stairs and winding through some hallways that could have just led to a boiler room, I stood before the waiting area of a Japanese restaurant. My friend and I got there early, so we didn't have to wait even though we had no reservations. We had the Hiyayakko, Maguro Yamakakke, Gyutan Yawaraka ni and the Kaisen Kimchi Don. Appetizers: The Hiyayakko Â was the loveliest piece of tofu that I've had in a very long time, perfect texture, perfect amount of onion and bonito on top. The Maguro Yamakakke might not be for everyone, but I love mountain yam in all it's forms and hardly ever have it at home, so I had to order it, the flavors are very simple, mostly from the soy sauce that I added, but the texture of the yam and taste and texture of the tuna in it were excellent. The Main Dishes, I will definitely order these again!: Gyutan Yawaraka ni: Deliciously slow cooked pieces of tongue in a rich miso base accompanied by tender mushrooms and turnip and potato. The chunks of tongue were a bit large, but they were so tender that I was able to easily splice them with my chopsticks. Kaisen Kimchi Don: The kimchi was delicious, yet not over powering.The sashimi used was so fine it virtually melted in your mouth, half a week later, I'm still thinking about it.",-1
yum,-1
"Huge portions, the green sauce is amazing. Â Great place for a bite. Â You will be full after. Â I really liked their yuca. Â  I went for dinner and it was much better than going in at lunch when it is super crowded.",-1
"Not that this pizza needs another review on Yelp for you to try it but Im gonna offer my two cents anyway. We ordered to-go and it was very easy and fast. Watching your pizza being made was great. We sort of just hung out int he back in front of the oven and nobody told us we were in the way :) Super nice staff, great friendly environment (Not like Grimaldis), and just a nice family feel. I would love to come here with a big group for some cozy comfort pizza the next time Im in NY. The only downer...of course...the price was $22 for a medium with pepperoni and mushrooms :( Worth it though.",-1
We had a great time. We sampled so many things and they weren't the usual boring fare so many restaurants put out. This place has delicious and unusual Japanese food. You have to try it. We had the tasting menu... it was great!,-1
"I love this lounge We had Â a small party with my friends . They have nice music and I love how they have couches , it makes it private.",-1
Went here with three other friends one time. There was a wait but the waitress was really cool. Ramen was amazing - definitely one of the best and generous servings I've had in NYC. Will be coming back very soon!,-1
Great for late night,-1
"I've lived near the original Taverna Kyclades in Astoria for 13 years, but have never been able to eat there due to it being legendary and non-stop packed with a waitlist on all days/times. So, I was thrilled to come across a T.K. in the East Village a few days ago. My friend and I, both lifelong Greek food fans, went in for lunch. We had some really tasty food (including spanakopita, grilled octopus, melitzanasalata and skordalia), but two things occurred that I never would have imagined in even the most low-end of Greek restaurants, let alone Taverna Kyclades. They had no pita. That's right -- NO pita on the premises. And what's more? They had no tzatziki. If you're thinking, ""WTF?"", I feel you. I'm not even sure you're allowed to operate a Greek restaurant without pita and tzatziki. There should be a law. Now, had this been a slammed Saturday night, we might have comprehended such a thing. But on Monday at lunchtime, there should be copious quantities of pita and tzatziki in a Greek restaurant. Just saying. [One other note: my beets with garlic and oil arrived as just beets. The garlic and oil were both MIA. Had to send them back to be properly made.]",-1
"The food at this place was so so good. I ordered the Steak and Eggs which comes with home fries, multigrain toast, and this amazing spinach cream. The home fries were nicely seasoned and the spinach cream was great to dip the potatoes into. The mimosa was made with fresh orange juice so it was especially good. My only qualm was after we were seated the hostess told us brunch was over and needed to be ordered within the next 10 minutes. No one came to our table to greet us or take our order for about 10 minutes but we were still able to order brunch. Highly recommend this place for brunch!",-1
"stopped by for breakfast the other day, got myself french toast with scrambeled eggs and it had an amazing taste to it. can i just say the service was fast and great for a busy morning.",-1
"Pretty good for the price and the quality, but I would say the $15 lobster roll was more bang for the buck than the $25 lobster meal as it seemed like more meat and a lot less work. Â Lobster for lobster meal however is prepared fresh when you order as they pull it out of the tank right then and there. Â And they gave us a whoopie pie (nothing special but it was free so it made it yummy).",-1
Friendly fast service. Â The tomato avocado salad was refreshing on a summer's day. Â The tuna tartare was meh..skip. I didn't like the chicken pot pie that much. Â I thought the filling wasn't creamy enough. The mussels were a lot better!,-1
AWESOME SPOT. Food is usually great and service as well. Sometimes a little aggressive. Calamari is Great and a lot of other items. Great Albanian Owner!,-1
"First off, I want to say that the service was exceptional. It started off with the hostess who I was informed was the assistant manager? I believe her name was something like Elisha. I heard from our waitress, Catherine, who was excellent, that she had recently been promoted. GOOD MOVE! Â She was very friendly & accommodating. No snobbery @ this place. They made you feel that your business was welcomed. After driving home from the Adirondacks I made a side trip into Manhattan before driving home to Long Island. There was a small wait but a half an hour without a reservation is no wait...I was happy to walk around alphabet city. Once seated I was graciously moved to a different location..lets say that due to a week of tent-living I needed a place to adequately park myself to enjoy the treat that was ahead. Food: clean tasting, fun, beautifully presented. My son & I started off with an order of crostini. We ordered the kale salad, which is deserving of the hype, and a fried green tomato & crabmeat with purslane (more purslane, please :) ?). Both were delicious. For entrees we ordered a wonderful tile fish with the slightest crunch atop. It was in a pool of green puree..fresh peas maybe. I tried to get every drop without making a spectacle & licking the plate!! Also ordered, the smoked carrot vegetarian entree. Simple, hearty & lovely. I thought the portions were nice. Of course @ 6'3"" my son could have eaten 3 carrot entrees! For dessert: the plum tart which was outstanding! It was not a traditional tart (with crust) but MUCH BETTER. It may have been one of the best desserts I have eaten @ a restaurant. The garnish of plum on the plate was tart but that did not detract from the sweet creation accompanied with a nice portion of hyssop ice cream. We also ordered the trio of sorbets. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous scoops. I also ordered a very nice glass of white wine (verdicchio). With tax a tad over $100.00. Great experience. Charming ambiance. The stools were very cute but personally I much preferred moving to a seat (table). Sorry this is so long but when I like a place I become very passionate about spreading the word. I will definitely return! I can't believe I only discovered it recently but very happy to hear that Northern Spy is going on 3 years!! WOOT WOOT....this is a goodie....(p.s. I do not eat any meat: red, white, or any color but every dish that went out was exquisite looking & meat dishes usually do not appeal to me but it is obvious that food is treated with respect here!).",-1
A cool comfortable environment with fresh and inexpensive food.,-1
"Came here for lunch and I could not believe how busy it was on a weekday afternoon. We had our shopping bags in tow and started with a few cocktails. I actually ordered a steak which was very very good. The service was excellent, very professional. I felt like I was in a scene from a movie from the 30's. Very nice place. It seemed as if we were definitely one of many tourists here. Either way food and drinks were great. We treated ourselves on this one as it definitely is not our usual price range for lunch but sometimes you just have to treat yourself!",-1
"This is probably the first restaurant I tried in the neighborhood, and it will always be my favorite. That's why it gets 5 stars. Not a gourmet experience, but a consistently good and well-priced home-cooking-style one. I go there knowing what I will order before I get a menu. I wake up after a night with a little too much drinking involved, and I know this place will have some combination of protein/starch to revive me. When the burden of choice in this food-centric city becomes too much and my boyfriend and I are about to give up over our collective indecisiveness, someone will chime in ""steinhof?"" and we will know in our hearts that this is what we wanted all along. They have nailed the comfort and style of a Viennese cafe...only wish I didn't have to mute my computer whenever I look at the menu online (the sound of music's ""the hills are alive"" comes on in full force). Versatile spot too, with both reliably good brunch/lunch, as well as a cozy weeknight dinner and bar offerings. What to order: haven't tried anything I didn't like yet. I usually order a beer and go for tubular meat, such as the weisswurst (veal sausage), or spicy debrecina, which come with potatoes and veggies. I'm partial to the pickled red cabbage. For vegetarians, the best thing I've had, arguably one of the best things on the menu, are the bread dumplings with mushroom fricasse, which could rival any meat dish for flavor. I even found good things to eat during a short-lived low carb phase I was going through, including a really tasty tomato soup with paprika and sour cream, and slew of delicious salads--love the chicken salad with sour cherries and the green beans with roquefort. For pescatarians, there's the trout, breaded or smoked, but I'm partial to the salmon cakes with spicy tomato salad. The sauerbraten tastes just like my grandma's brisket. Goulash night (Mondays) is a pretty good bargain. They also offer trout and a few sides and dessert for a good price.",-1
"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that the decor/ambience is a little down-scale for the fantastic food and incredible service. I've had eggs benedict all over Brooklyn and this place might have my favorite - with well-seasoned home fries and a generous green salad for a very reasonable price. I just brought my parents there for dinner and we had a practically perfect experience - attentive, charming servers, scrumptious boeuf bourguignon, fresh bubbly ($5/glass!). My dad devoured the shrimp and scallops, and my mother and sister had perfectly cooked skirt steak. Will be back soon!",-1
"Great burgers -- nice and juicy with some interesting topping. Â 282 has a bar feel (well, I guess it is a bar), but the burgers aren't your typical pub-tasting burger, which is a nice change. I like the 282 burger, with chilies and some kind of special creamy sauce. Â Fries and onion rings are fantastic as well. Â The sweat potato fries have a ton of flavor and are usually perfectly cooked. I haven't tried anything else on the menu as I'm a simple burger kind of guy. There mixed drinks are really well made too. Â The spicy bloody Mary is great, although watch out if you down one on an empty stomach as the spiceness isn't forgiving.",-1
"Fantastic sandwich shop. For all you schmucks who think subway is a good price for a shite sandwich.,, come here and try a great price for an awesome, awesome sandwich!!!",-1
I love this place. I've eaten here many times and the food is always fantastic! I would recommend the octopus appetizer to start with. Great atmosphere and definitely not overpriced. This is probably my favorite restaurant in Manhattan.,-1
Chicken and Rice at 4 in the morning! Yes please! There's a reason why this place always has a long line. Give it a try.,-1
"Nice dining experience. We had the tasting menu with paired wines. The menu was heavily slanted towards seafood....which was disappointing. The quantities were very limited...even for a tasting menu. The restaurant is small..20 seats...which was fun. The food was good but very little....""I cannot wait to come back entrees"". With all the restaurants in NYC I would recommend others!",-1

Food is excellent and great service!,-1
"My first experience was with their chicken&lamb with rice last Friday when it was pouring. I worked late (Yea, sucks especially on a Friday). I had the cravings for a solid dinner. I read from Midtown Lunch that rain is usually the best time to go to The Stand. There was still a short line of people waiting, I bought it, walked through Times Sq. in the rain (without an umbrella like the silly monkey I always am), and took the train home. Even after it got cold, I enjoyed the meal very much. I like how I was in charge of the sauces myself and the container is aluminum (not unhealthier and cheap styrofoam like most places). I've tried a couple of other places around my office but they are not nearly as good as this cart. The one on 48th and 3rd is decent though in the flavor dept. but they're lacking in size...which will lead me into the discussion of the day. 53RD AND 6TH VS. SAMMY'S I have summer fridays now so I can bounce earlier but late enough to miss the full-on lunch hour rush. I decided to hit up the not-so-famous 53rd and 6th lunchtime cart. They are just as good in foodwise. You don't get your own sauces, portion seems a bit smaller but it is only $5, not $6 during evenings, and still aluminum container. I grabbed a seat somewhere close and devoured my chicken&lamb with rice. It was good street meats. I'm usually a chicken&rice kinda guy but I like to compare the flavors in the combo so getting The Mix has been more and more my usual now. I went back to my area to chill and relax a bit with buds. Afterwards, on my way home, I decided to visit Sammy's, the Chicken&Rice king in Jackson Heights, Queens. There was no long line but certainly a bunch of people wanting to order. I decided to get my current usual, walked about 10 mins. back home, and tried my best to enjoy dinner. The food was alright. Something was missing though and the guy probably thought I wouldn't notice. How about equal part Chicken? How do you mess up Chicken&Lamb with rice? Well, by giving me 90% lamb and barely any chicken. WAY TO GO! I don't know if this is because I'm not a usual customer but come on now! He heard me say Chicken AND Lamb. The guy, not Sammy, but his assistant, even told me to take a can of soda with me. I knew it was kinda suspicious but hey, free soda! I grabbed my ginger ale and walked home of course! Maybe he thought I wouldn't complain since I got a free soda but he could've told me to wait for the chicken. I'm patient enough to wait with the crowd. Maybe he just wanted me off on my way and sent me packing with carbonated delight. I'm not fond of their styrofoam but they will not get any stars taken away for it. Let's do a final breakdown: SAMMY'S Food is good, Sauces are ok, no presence on hot sauce, my combo priced at $6 but I didn't even get enough chicken and adding soda to the unhealthy mix is an unequal treat to me enjoying chicken. Â I will give them props for their lamb, chopped into little chunks, and tasty. Portion is not hefty to justify $6 in Queens. Regular Basmati Rice is ok. Â  53rd and 6th (Day) Food is good, Sauces are ok, a better hot sauce, my combo is only $5 and this is in the City, not Queens, the slices of pita are a welcomed side, chicken is solid but lamb is average, not chunks, but slithers. Portion is decent for $5 in the City. Orange Basmati Rice is decent. Â  53rd and 6th (Evening) Same as day, except combo is $6 dinnertime price, you get your own sauces and still decent portion. Yes, much better than PUNY sammy's and their stingy $6 platter in Queens. The Winner: 53RD AND 6TH during Lunch. Somebody take away the Vendy that was ever awarded to Sammy's and make sure these guys get one! LOL.",-1
"One of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat in NYC. A perfect place for a romantic date or just catching up with friends. There's always a great crowd, small and cozy place, awesome music, friendly staff.. and it doesn't hurt that the food comes in pretty generous portions! Unless you get a booth to yourselves, be ready to get extra comfortable with the strangers around you. It's nice that the place is small but that means really tiny tables and being squished with the other guests sitting about 10 centimeters away from you. Good for eavesdropping, bad for arm room. Please don't leave this place without ordering the CORN. A little pricey for nearly five bucks for two corns on the cob, but they aren't JUST corns on the cob. They're rolled (laced?) with cojita cheese and sprinkled with cayenne pepper... with a squeeze of fresh lime juice at your disposal. Warm and smoky right off the grill. An explosion of creamy, buttery, spicy and zesty goodness in your mouth. I'm getting giddy just thinking about it. ORDER IT.",-1
"As soon as you buy it you MUST eat it. It's only AMAZING right then....don't let it get cold...once you do...it's a GREAT pizza....but still not as amazing...but you get the idea...lines are long, small space to order, be ready when you get there. Huge slice of a pizza I buy two slices and split it with my hubby!! We love it! (~$10 for dinner/lunch...not bad) We ate it so fast I never get a chance to take a picture of it! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! MUST eat the Artichoke pizza and eat it IMMEDIATELY!",-1
"What a beautiful new restaurant and bar. A cozy, warm space, exceptionally well designed by StephanieGOTO, managed by a team of truly passionate professionals serving hand-crafted drinks and highly creative food. Outstanding new restaurant. Great cocktails - let the mixologist create your cocktail - it will be just perfect.",-1
"I was introduced to this outstanding establishment last night, by friends who live nearby. From the moment you enter through a gorgeous courtyard, you step inside in a charming, multi-level, warm hued room. You simply must start a cocktail. My favorite was the ""Hemingway"". Many were enjoyed The food and service were simply outstanding in every respect. The ambiance was very special, and this place would be perfect for a romantic dinner and for a fun night with friends.",-1
"This was our first trip to this restaurant, brought in by friends who love it. We were impressed from the beginning to the end. Even though from the outside it presents an unassuming entrance, once we entered the place was warm and friendly, the service was friendly and careful for details, appetizers were delicious and my hake was fresh and nicely presented and spiced. My wife had a good appetizer, but she felt her hanger stake was chewy and could not finish it. Place hold promise tho and we will be willing to return.",-1
"I went with a big group with reservations on Friday night. Â Despite the difficulty of agreeing on a few dishes ( it is family style ) the food was excellent. Â The penne a la vodka was memorable and the sangria was good as well. Â I would come back here for sure. Â The price actually came out very low because we shared for 11 people we had 5 entrees, 2 apps and sangrias for everyone and it was only 22 dollars each with a 20% tip. Â Not bad. I was also impressed that there was decent food that wasnt too corny in the time square area.",-1
"Instantly felt at ease with the decor of this highly reputed restaurant...its an eclectic mix that works in a kind of blue jeans with Louboutin's kind of way. Relaxed service and vintage mismatching crockery follows the theme and so does the food..... Love the fine flavours of lighter dishes; the salads, the sea bass but there is bulk too if you want that...incredible fried chicken and one of the best hamburgers anywhere. This is a place to go in groups and have a great time but equally if you want a venue for a romantic date with atmosphere.",-1
"Great bistro with fun service and good food, can be very noisy at times , bread is some of the best I have had!!",-1
"I was there yesterday. haven't been there in a long time. They still haven't lost their touch. I vote it to be the best Thai in Bk and NY, The great thing is that its fresh and yummy",-1
I usually eat at this place and I can say their pizza is really good. The spamoni ice cream is a good ending to the pizza.,-1
"Food was pretty tasty, but the overall experience was just so-so. Good for those eating before plays as the food and service was quick. The service is great and the building itself is worth the visit. There are still glimpses of old NYC in the decor and layout of the place. Portions are good size and prices are very moderate for the area.",-1
"Rose Water has always been a favorite brunch place of mine, but I only recently tried their dinner and was sadly disappointed to have it fall short of my high expectations. I had dinner there with the Park Slope Dinner Club, a group of proud Brooklynites that gathers monthly to eat our way through the neighborhood. We loved the atmosphere and our waiter Wolf was super nice. We all ordered from the Market Menu. The bread was superb and was my favorite part of the meal. Others really enjoyed the shaved fennel salad, creamy polenta, and the roasted chicken. The tile fish failed to impress, as did the soup, which were both too salty. The most disappointing part of all was the dessert. The meyer lemon treat was not at all what we envisioned from its description and the pear cobbler could have used some more time in the oven. Both were OK and a far cry from the delight we hoped for.",-1
If there is one star option I'm doing it. Such rude crew in New York's restaurant is outrageous. AVOID THIS PLACE!,-1
The best restaurant on the lower east side. Â Host is very gracious. Â Love,-1
Let me just start by saying - Swine Punch. AHHHH!!! Had that itchin' for some bacon again too. And nothing beats the bloody marys here. Yea...you get a beer with that divine concoction.,-1
"One of Fort Greene's best new gems, and I keep wanting to bring everyone I know here with me because everyone should enjoy the deliciousness that is at Lulu and Po. The (very attractive) staff are really really nice, not at all pretentious, and really know their complex menu. The kitchen is open and the chefs seem to be enjoying their work, probably because they know everything they are making is incredible, and the small restaurant has a very chill vibe. I personally enjoy the whole open kitchen thing too, and so this makes the small space seem even more like a welcome and cozy place. The trout is so perfectly seared, and charred scallion bits cover the skin, mixing in well with capers and whatever else they put on it. The burger is always a home run, and the lentils mix a dollop of sour cream with enough spice to give them a kick, and make Â lentils all of a sudden become interesting again. I am also a huge fan of their cheese selections (all local) and their spanish octopus comes with a refreshing mint jalapeÃ±o sauce. I recently had the bone marrow tacos - this was actually my first time trying marrow, and I decided that I simply am not a fan of its texture really, although I could tell that the bones had been very well roasted and were packed with flavor, and the side topping of cilantro and pickled red onions was an appropriate complement to the marrow and the corn tortilla. Â Oh, and the fries are ridiculous (in the good way) and their house salad always has nice crisp greens, and lovely sugar coated walnuts to offset the more acidic dressing. I will also say that I love the tapas portions they offer, because I never leave too full, and have a personal dislike for the culture of excessive portions. However, between my boyfriend and I, we will easily finish 6 things, and still have room for dessert. So, the only down side is that it all adds up, and so I can't eat here every day, and instead have to limit my visits to once every 2 weeks or so. In the long run this is probably a good thing because it just wouldn't be fair for me to be able to eat food this delicious every day of my life. At first they were cash only, which annoyed me but I kept coming back, and eventually they figured this out and started to accept credit cards. Thank you Lulu and Po! Â This place definitely puts Fort Greene on the NYC foodie destination map.",-1
"We came here because we had a living social voucher, but i would definitely come back. Â  I had the quesadilla- which was so good! It's not an American quesadilla at all with just meat cheese and veggies but filled with all sorts of deliciousness- rice, beans, etc. It also came with fries. In addition to that we shared two papusas and flan. We also had three drinks and our bill was low Â Plus I still had half my quesadilla to take home since it was very large. I also give them credit- it seems like they are reading the reviews because A) when I asked for water the server asked if I wanted tap or bottled for $1 B) spoke English to us, or at least enough to communicate back and forth ( but even if they didn't, the menu is in English- you can get by) and C) was very friendly and food came out quick. Â  Great place",-1
Amazing little classy market,-1
Stumbled on this place after some wine and cupcakes. We did not know what to expect as it was just a chance walkin. We were welcomed and given a table infront of the open kitchen. Our meal was fantastic with a nice bottle of wine. The service was very freindly even though the place was packed.,-1
"Lam Zhou is absoutely the best noodle shop in NYC , they taste great and have probably the best tasting handmade noodles in North America. Â try them you love them",-1
"I've been for lunch the last 3 weekends out of 4, and I missed the one Sunday because I was out of town. That's how big a fan I am of this ramen joint. I've eaten at 2 Momofukus and at Setaya, and Ippudo beats all of them hands down where the ramen is concerned. The tonkotsu broth is rich and dericious! I've tried all the permutations and combinations, and still like the basic broth best, though the ultra rich miso runs a close second. However, Momofuku does the Hirata pork belly buns better. Ippudo's is a wee bit too sweet - I am not a huge fan of the kewpie mayo they slather on it, and neither does the lame iceberg lettuce leaf do it any justice. Momofuku's buns have tons of scallions, a very nice compliment to the juicy slab of pork belly. All three times I've been there, the hostesses have been non-Japanese, but yell out the required hellos and goodbyes appropriately, and loudly. I wonder if everyone has to be a Japanese speaker ...",-1
"Always have had great experiences here! Eating in, take out, everything. The food is great, I like that they have stuff marked as Vegan, Vegetarian, and Gluten Free, and the service is wonderful. Not to mention the decor is quite nice and inviting. I could eat barrels of their black beans and sweet plantains. mmm Also they have a big drink menu and even some really nice non-alcoholic ones--the mango mojito is amazing, though I'm not sure why it's $4...",-1
"Honestly the only downfall I found about this place is that there can be a long wait which is fine usually but there is no where to stand or sit in the venue while waiting, and in the winter it can be rough. Nice hostess and staff. Really freaking great food. I've had everything from the couscous, the Sausage Merguez Sandwhich, The Breakfast Plate, Avocado Toast and Baked Pasta. Loved it all really.",-1
"Good size portions + yummy margaritas. Salads are delicious, so is shrimp. We got the best table in the middle of the balcony area.",-1
"The chicken is nothing special. Â to make matters worse the service is awful. There was a line and one of the workers said "" I can't help you because our manager jen said only one to a computer"" wow. then to make matters worse the owner decided to crank the techno beats so loud that you had to yell your order, and then cashier had to yell your order to the cook even though they are next to each other. Â Don't waste your time here",-1
"Its as rare as seeing a white tiger- a hip restaurant where the staff is friendly, professional and warm and the food is central to the mission. My three visits to Public confirmed this is one of downtown's great dining experience. First Alsatian white and consummate people watching at the bar. What a mix of artists, writers, hipsters and the cultured class. Then off to our table for a brilliant meal. It doesn't matter what we ate.. It was just the kind of perfect new york evening where we never wanted to leave.",-1
"the food is as good as it gets they have a great mix of things, something for everyone always fresh, clean staff great manager always checks in to make sure things going ok restrooms clean there is one big problem here that they need to address, the right side of the place the floor is on a slant, DO NOT LET THEM SEAT YOU THERE, you will feel like you are sliding off your chair, when you go eat somewhere you should be able to enjoy your mean and not worry about flying off chairs, in addition a few of their tables are shaky, common problem in restaurants but this place needs to buy new ones when that happens. they can also stop with the glass ketchup bottles, its annoying, high risk of making a mess and the easy to squeez is just fine.",-1
"something that tastes this good and is this cheap will have you pinching yourself and making plans for the next time you can stop by. Â fried is better than boiled. also, get a sesame pancake with beef or duck - considering how cheap they are you should probably just get one of each.",-1
"Sophisticated, creative food without the fuss and stiffness from a high-end restaurant. The menu is simple and focused, transforming simple ingredients into innovative dishes.So nice presentations! They take the snob out of fine dining with a cozy and comfortable setting. Heavenly fresh foccacia with ricotta to start. Kieran takes you thru the beverage list. Restaurant that manages to feel intimate, bustling, special and everyday, all at once.I just love this place.",-1
"I was pleasantly surprised over pretty much everything at Hudson Clearwater. Pretentious little entrance that tries to be anything but leads into a great little garden and a nice, laid-back restaurant with a great attitude and great food. The staff that looks like they were hired mostly because of their ridiculously Â good looks caught me off guard by being knowledgeable, professional, and simply great. Amuse buche was delicious, a perfect little palate cleanser and absolutely unexpected. I had the skirt steak, which was cooked to perfection and while not being dressed up in a ton of stuff simply delicious. Sometimes the meat and produce should be allowed to do the talking, and the kitchen staff here are apparently good listeners. The only downside here were the cocktails, unfortunately, but a decent wine list and the surprisingly low prices in addition to everything else about Hudson Clearwater will ha Â eme coming back for seconds and twentythirds.",-1

"This place will always be special to me since it was the first fine dining restaurant I ever tried in New York City and it blew me away a few years ago. It's hard to give it 4 stars but I'm edging my way over there since I'm getting spoiled by some nicer restaurants that have been popping up lately. Still, it's very reliable and the spicy duck meatballs never disappoint. I took a first date there this past Saturday night and it was great. A little awkward (mostly for her since I don't have the embarassment gene) since the tables are very close together so our neighbors could hear pretty much everything we talked about. I'm sure the eavesdropping didn't last long as my toilet humor probably wasn't that interesting to listen to I'm sure. As always, I'll be back in a few months to check on things. Harold's still got it.",-1
Pizza with Pizzaz!,-1
"I really don't get why this place is always so lively. It's really badly decorated, with tacky Ikea Furniture poorly arranged. The food is good, but the portions are tiny and it's DAMN expensive. I feel like it's for all the young PR people in peacoats who used to live in Chelsea or SoHo but now live in shiny new Williamsburg condos, and are driving prices way up, for everything, in this case, food.",-1
I've been Saraghina a couple of times. Â Always great service and great food. Â My husband and I took my sis and her hubby when they came to visit from NJ - they loved it. Â  Can you believe since then they've gone a few times to eat at this place but they didn't come visit me??!! LOL Just beware it's cash only and the place can put a dent in your wallet.,-1

"This place is SOOO DELICIOUS!!! Ive read about this place and have walked by it during lunch, but the line was just too long for my short lunch period. But today i was able to try it after work around 530 and there was no line so it was perfect. I had the first thing on the menu, the pulled pork sandwich along with a side of the grilled corn on the cob (covered in chili mayo, cayenne pepper and coconut flakes.... AMAZING!). The sandwich was out of this world...dare I say a top 3 sandwich I have ever had (rivals that of paseos in Seattle). They piled on the pork, the ingredients were compiled perfectly, the chili mayo complimented terrifically, and the bread was great with just the right consistency of softness and crunchiness. They really hit a home run!!! I must mention again that the side of grilled corn on the cob with chili mayo, cayenne and coconut was SO great!!! A+++++++++ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Only down side, my drink... Â I got the blood orange lemonade and it was sooooo sour and tart that it really was undrinkable. But im not gonna let one bad drink take any stars away... This place rocks!!!",-1
"I love this place.Loved the steak burrito and the grilled steak sandwich.Their portions are also very satisfying. Always crowded, so stay away if you are not from the neighborhood. Definitely going to back to try all the other yummy sounding things on the menu.",-1
"Better than the tacos from the trucks, although also more expensive at the strange price of $3.67 (none of the prices have round numbers and I don't think it's so the taxes will come out round). Carnitas was a little too greasy, chicken about right. Â Strange to hear ""next guest"" called at a tacqueria.",-1

"Yes...I love this place. Â Worth waiting 2 hours? Â NO WAY!!!! Â I have been here at least 40 times....my go to ramen place in NYC. Â I try not to to with more than one other person...infact, I try to go her alone as the line is short for a single Â :)",-1
"The food is excellent here! Â The eggplant with olive always made my day. Â I also love the crowd in here, it's filled with young artists and gallery assistants. Â The price is great the for the value. Â Just as long as you stay off staying at the hotel or hanging at the tiny bar/club you'll be more than satisfied!",-1
"I went in on a pretty quiet afternoon for a late lunch with some friends from town. The decor is not bad, wooden chairs and tables, some booths, a very worn look, but its meant to look like that. The tables however were not meant for more than 2. We were a party of 3 and space was scarce. The menu is a single page and quite frankly nothing special. Pricing is not that great either, which is the my main plight with The Smith... no real bang for your buck. I ordered two appetizers, fried calamari and a seafood platter, nothing special here. My entree however, a salmon salad, was delicious, and it was a huge portion, but it was more salad than salmon and that's a real bummer since it cost me $17. A nice casual lunch spot, but it isn't going to be a regular for me.",-1
"Bring your sweatpants and loosen your belt because they are very generous here. I've had a couple dishes: steamed buns, pork noodle soup, beef noodle soup and spicy beef soup and of course, their signature dumplings! It's very casual, mostly Chinese customers which is always a good sign. The decor or atmosphere isn't 5 star quality but the food makes up for it. For the beef and pork noodle soups, they give you a TON of noodles. Like the amount of carbs one would eat pre-marathon. All homemade. The beef one was ok- not too generous with the beef. The pork, however, they were very generous with. The broth is decent. The steamed buns are cheap and delicious, nothing extraordinary by typical bun standards. The spicy beef soup was vegetable laden, filling and SPICY. They are very generous with the meat but skimped on the noodles (which isn't bad, you'll struggle to finish it). I wish this place was open later- their fried dumplings are perfect drunk food. Greasy, savory and fresh! They're also very affordable. Seating is limited so it's best you don't come at peak lunch and dinner hours. This isn't a date spot by any means, simply a place to get some AMAZING food. I always end up waddling out cursing your small stomach. Cash only.",-1
"Great surprise at the end of an alley! Waiters were really nice, delicious drinks and food (the fish of the day I had, served full but without any fishbone was scrumptious!), great ambiance... A place to go definitely, the only drawback being that you cannot always reserve a table.",-1
"Great little French Venue with very good prices. I'm a fan...Best Onion Soup in NYC, Â I love French food and I'm always looking for a new place to try, since I tried .Le Grainne Cafe, I've been back 4 or 5 times. When I visited NYC and tried La Giranne, I was completely blown away by the food and the service.",-1

Service was proper.",-1
"I went there recently and I have to say this is a great place if you're looking for Penang style hawker/street food. It is very authentic and the food come very close to what you would get in Malaysia especially in Penang Island. Even the waitress is from there. I can't speak for other ""types"" of dishes since my goal was to get those exact food I mentioned above and for that I was very satisfy with it.",-1

"It is a small, cute place but I was not blown away. I went during the week for lunch so luckily we did not have to wait. The service was fine and the food was OK. I guess I should come back for brunch.",-1
"The food and service weren't bad but not as good as we've had elsewhere in NYC and not as good as I would have expected based on its reputation. It was morning so didn't try the legendary cheesecake. The place itself looks great though! I heard they are moving location as the site is to be developed, so maybe that is having an impact on things.",-1
"This is my first visit. We had a department lunch and it was remarkable. Ancora is the - old world ambience, friendly wait staff, creative dishes, outstandingly fresh cuisine. I had my favorite, Chicken Marsala, which was excellent. My coworkers had a varied assortment- ravioli, steak, scungilli, and snapper. Everything met or exceeded expectations. While the service was impeccable, the wait between courses was exceedingly long, but that may be attributed to the holiday rush. It was a full house but worth the wait. Looking forward to returning for dinner.",-1
"The ramen is very good and the add-ons are delicious, I highly recommend the pork bellies! Whenever I would go to ippudo, the food is always great and I like the fact that you can get more at a discounted price so that you don't have to waste your broth! The only down side is the prices are a bit high for ramen but I guess they've got to pay the rent somehow. The lines are also ridiculous, I've shown up and have been told the wait was 2 hours in the past so I left to go elsewhere. The staff is so-so, sometimes you get a really good server and other times you get servers who look like they don't want to be there. The hostesses are also a no-go, with the crowded entry, a lot of people flock to stand outside. Don't rely on the hostesses to come get you if you stand outside. They never leave their podium and speak softly so you can barely hear them when you're standing by them. Ippudo should really get the hostesses to speak up and to also go outside and call out names as well. For the amount of money you pay, you want every staff member to treat you well. I'm hesitant to give them 4 stars but if the food wasn't so good and SOME of the staff were so good, I'd drop it down to 3 stars.",-1

"AWESOME pizza, went early-ish (4-5pm) on a Friday and with their new place there's TONS of seating. Maybe waited 15 mins. Easier to get in if you have two people in my opinion. Pizza is very affordable and the location is nice you can walk the promenade afterwards. Combined pricing, atmosphere, and most of all TASTE makes this the best pizza I've had. Will definitely go a couple more times this summer!",-1

"I live and recently started working very close to Williamsburger, so despite a sub-par experience there right after they opened, I've ordered lunch several times in recent weeks. My experiences as a whole with their food have not been great, but I've continued to order because they're super close and sometimes I need to eat quickly. As of today, however, I'm officially done. Here's why: 1. The price of their burgers relative to the size is outrageous. I actually prefer way smaller portions than what most people wolf down these days, however, to charge steep prices for smaller than average burgers is not okay. They do give you an enormous bushel of good fries with your burger, but it feels like they're meant to distract you from how small your burger is. The burgers do taste good, but are not worth the price. 2. Â They appear to care more about the ingredient design of the food on their menu than whether or not their customers actually want to eat it that way. I've attempted to order things on a few occasions and asked for an ingredient or two to be left out (such as their ""signature salad"" which has around 20 ingredients) and been told by the staff that they can't make alterations. If I'm willing to give you $12 for a salad and all you have to do is leave out the tomatoes, celery and apples, wouldn't you take my $12 and give me my salad they way I want to eat it? 3. Their food is inconsistent. I've ordered chicken fingers a few times, because Williamsburger actually makes some of the best damn chicken fingers I've ever had. Huge and meaty, 100% white meat, awesomely battered and gnarled-looking, not greasy, and with excellent dipping sauces. So today, in the midst of the umpteenth storm of this winter, I ordered the chicken fingers and trudged through slush and rain to pick them up. I get back to the office, open the box, and...what the hell are these? They're flat, uniformly shaped like pears, clearly made from processed chicken, and truly disappointing to eat. They tasted like frozen chicken fingers from a diner or even a fast food restaurant. They were unrecognizable visually and taste-wise from what I've ordered many times before. So now, no matter how far I have to go or how long I have to wait for lunch, I'm no longer eating at Williamsburger. I'm sure they'll do just fine in this industrial area with a lack of restaurants nearby, but they'll have one less customer.",-1
"For those willing to make the hike to BK, Rose Water is definitely worth the trip. Â Rose Water has a nice, cozy atmosphere with the option of sitting outside.

Nice little Cuban place for food. Â It smells great from outside. Â I had the Arroz Con Pollo Â and it was pretty good. Â I'm taking off one star because it was as little dry.

This is a small place with an incredible vibe. The food is fantastic. I had the chefs tasting menu and every dish was on point. A must try!,-1
A bit hard to find but worth the effort. Asian/Japanese cuisine with some emphasis on Kobe beef. The very knowledgeable server explained all dishes very patiently to a crowd of 6 (some of them picky eaters) and made selection easy. The food is excellent with great flavors and presentation making it a perfect evening. Good value. We are looking forward to our next visit.,-1
"Everything that came out of this kitchen was better than anticipated. The falvors, textures and visiual appeal of Mr Forgione's creations will thrill you. The service is thoughtful, attentive and I felt I actually got sincere answers to all my menu questions. The waiter even recommended a less expensive bottle of wine when I asked for some help with the lengthy and quirky wine list. Really nice place to dine, thanks Marc.",-1
"Cheap, filling, salty and a bit greasy. Go for the pork katsu. Yes, it's a big piece of meat. I'd avoid the shrimp just because everything here seems so processed.. I dunno. Doesn't scream ""fresh"" to me, and seafood's gotta be fresh.",-1

I've been to Peaches several times since it has been open. Â I'm so glad they opened up in an area that is clearly in need of some decent restaurants. Â The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly. Â The downside is they have consistently slow service too. Â I wonder why after being open a couple of years they haven't improved their speed...,-1
"Yup they nailed it alright! Best burger I've had on the East Coast. Probably the best burger I've had ever. I think it's absolutely justifies the hype. Every bit of it. I had the truffle burger and wanted to come back the next day for another. The wait times are a bit long. Come early, avoid weekends at all costs and come hungry. It will not disappoint.",-1

Wow!! The best Thai food I've had in manhattan! I've been dying to find a place that makes Thai food the way I've had in Thailand and this is the first place in manhattan that makes padthai right (not super sweet). I stumbled on this place with a friend who lives in the area and it seems to have popped up out of nowhere. But we were so glad we found it. The decor is really cool and has a nice grungy look. The chef was this really nice thai woman and took the time to talk to our group. I don't usually write reviews but this place is new and i really want to support them. Go check it out!,-1
"I had dinner at Osteria Morini with a couple friends the other day and had a wonderful time. I don't really remember what we had exactly, but the meatballs and the tagliatelle ragu was excellent. However, the restaurant was a little crowded and my elbow was constantly bumping into the person sitting behind me.. Apart from that, we all had a good time during dinner and will definitely come back.",-1
"We had the whole Sea Bass,which I would absolutely recommend. The service was fantastic and the Christmas decorations made it very cozy. Only thing I would change would to be make it a tad brighter, as we had difficulty reading our menus.",-1
"This place was great not a fan of the waits though..... I took some out of town visitors for dinner here. Â They LOVED it! Â The check for dinner was really small.....(under $100 for four entrees and appetizers, including tip and tax!!!) Â granted it did not include wine. Â We already had glasses wine from the bar next door (we just received out bar order when we were escorted to the restaurant). Â The host gets a pretty good work out, running back and forth between the restaurant and bar, fetching diners when Bianca is ready to seat them. Â He appeared to be a little stressed out BUT he was nice to all of his customers. The restaurant serves traditional Italian fare and they do a pretty good job. Â I had the lasagna (traditional Bolognese) and shared the fried artichokes and grilled octopus salad appetizers. These were delicious. This eatery needs reservations - they only seat full parties. Â Several people were abandoning their 4th diner because they did not want to wait another 30-45 minutes to be seated (rough crowds or lousy friends). Â They also need a larger space.",-1

"It's so tiny we missed it walking down the street and had to turn back around. Glad we turned around because this was exactly what we were looking for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, potatoes, tostada, cafe con leche - Yum. This place was cheap for NYC in the Theater District. We definitely paid less than $20 for breakfast including the tip. We saw them making the Cuban sandwiches before we left and ended up coming back there for lunch. We ordered the Cuban Sandwich and it was really good too. They offer a lot of traditional dishes cafeteria style like arroz con gandules and pernil. They gave us a free sample of some chicken drummette which I really enjoyed too.",-1
Great place to buy and eat Italian food !!!!!,-1
"Never had a meal I didn't like here. I've been for brunch, lunch, and dinner and it's all great. It can get noisy but not too bad. Back patio is really nice, especially for brunch. I also like hanging at the bar. They have a tv and play the games, which is nice. When the World Cup was playing this summer we wanted to watch the US game there but when we asked the guy if they would play sound, he gave us a totally unnecessarily snooty answer. Other than that, the ppl are really friendly. Â Definitely recommend.",-1
"i should preface this, and probably all of my yelp reviews by saying i do not have sky high standards. Â i've lived in new york my whole life and despite, or maybe because of this, i don't feel like every meal has to be my last. Â  went here for the first time the other night and echo what other reviewers have said: i like the idea a lot. Â and yes, it seems a little pricey, but what do you really expect to pay in the land of all that is hip in 2009? Â  the best of the pizzas we ordered was the margherita, and yes, i'm sure that's misspelled. Â it was simple and tasty, the right amount of slightly sweet sauce and salty cheese. Â me likey. it's a bit of a trek for me, but if i lived around there, i'm sure i'd get take out all the time. Â i wish yelp could do 1/2 stars, cause this a three and halfer for me.",-1
We luckily arrived before the big crowds came for brunch. The menu has Mediterranean overtones and the whole menu is offered all day which is a nice perk. Feel like a burger at 9am? Go for it! The house cured duck bacon should not be missed. It's definitely worth a shot if you're in the neighborhood. They offer some really unique items not on your standard eggs and toast menus that you can find elsewhere for brunch.,-1
"Great ambiance, small place with good vibes, but the food was not what I expected, all our 4 dishes were served with toast, same bread, it made the diner bowering, considering, in my opinion it was over price.",-1
Very good Italian restaurant. Started with mortadella and cheeses which were excellent. The service was very professional. Would highly recommend to friends.,-1
"Get the sticky buns, you wont regret it. I don't understand all the negative reviews for waiting time, I'm a frequent here (as I work down the block), and all hours of the day I never see any lines, or when I do, everyone is served quickly. Really good on the wallet as well, when it came time to assess the damage done to me, came out to $15 for a really filling meal. Would definitely recommend.",-1

"Hey Newyorkers what happen to you? Is this what you call a great pie? Did you start forgetting about your own roots? I had their famous Artichoke:, thick slice pie with pieces of artichoke, spinach, in Alfredo Sauce along with regular mozzarella. Excuse me but highly overrated, I didn't see anything special in their pizza. Â This pizza joint for clubbers, you go there after you get drunk. Everything tastes good once you got drunk anyways. I also tried Margarita and Sicily. I should give them 5 star based on ther Marketing but Yelp don't care about that.",-1
"Went for a quiet dinner here one evening in September. It was really warm outside even though it was after 9pm so was delighted that the place was air conditioned! Cannot recommend this place highly enough. The staff are so nice and friendly without being too intrusive, the food is amazing and there is a lovely, very italian atmosphere in the place.YUM!) 5 stars!",-1
"They might have some really good marinara pizza, but it definitely is not worth the 5 dollars a slice they charge. I mean seriously 5 dollars a slice? It also took them almost 25 minutes just to get the pizza. If it werent for the pricing and wait time, this place would get at least 4 stars. Also, they close almost instantly when the run out of doe ha!",-1
"Really? Yelpers, I'm dismayed at your inflated reviews...Not only does the emperor not have any clothes, there is no emperor!!! This guy was trying to become the next IRON CHEF??? (Or was it Top Chef Master?) The dumplings were literally worse than frozen dumplings from a bag. Â Bland and uninspired. Â the pork buns were so boring. Â No crunch, no flavor contrast. Â Just some mushy anise tasting meat in a bun. Â The skate dish was unbearably salty. Â We'll never return.",-1
"This restaurant was fantastic. As you would expect the food here was sensational. In addition the staff went above and beyond to make our dinner to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary even more special.

"In the heart of the theater district, Carmine's serves Italian in HUGE family style portions, My wife & I got chicken parmigiana ($36) and took half of it home, so go with at least three or preferably four people. Everything is a la carte, including pasta and salad (which were immense). Quality was good, not great and the place is very loud so, it's a great location for a romantic dinners or even conversation, but it is an experience and close to most Broadway theaters.",-1
best pizza place in brooklyn!,-1
"I must admit, at first when I looked at the food, I lost my appetite a bit. They should definitely work on their presentation. Otherwise the flavors were new and awesome for me. The lotus root fried chips dish - Renkon age is to die for. My friend had the Pork Tatsuta and I was tempted to grab her plate and eat all of that too! The service was decent.",-1
"Having been to many of the top rated restaurants in New York City, I was looking forward to eating at Bouley, rated 2nd for food in Zagat. Unfortunately, I left quite disappointed with the experience. I had the special lunch menu of five courses...none were a culinary ""wow"". Although the quality of each ingredient was superb, I felt that the somewhat exotic additions to each dish resulted in less than wonderful flavors. Please note I welcome creative cusine; I simply feel Bouley's attempts at modernity did not work. Service was also less than expected for a restaurant of this reputation. We waited more than 5 minutes after being seated before anyone came to to take our orders. I ran out of water midway through the meal; no one came to refill it until I was almost finished with the dessert course. We had several waiters bring courses,and we were never served by the lady who originally took our orders. I find this odd. I actually wish I could give Bouley a 3.5 rating. Needless to say, I do not intend to return to this restaurant.",-1

The prices are good, you can get a good steak for around $20-26. It is a must even if you're from New York or not!!! If you want to eat there the best is to make an reservation.",-1
"Really fun spot. Food was good- the crab fritters are packed with crab meat, and the crab pot had a ton of crab in it. Shrimp scampi was very tasty as well. Not that busy when I was there, but I bet it's packed in the Summer. Can't wait to go back and play mini-golf before dinner.",-1
"Ok so this weekend, I went to Lombardi's. I was expecting a lot more of a wait than I got. Â Me and my boyfriend went on Saturday around lunch time and waited 15 minutes. There was lots of places to sit and wait and smell and watch. Now we love food especially pizza. So I have very high expectations. We sit down and ordered a large pie with fresh garlic on it (because it was free). It came maybe within 10 minutes which was great. The first bite was amazing, cheese, sauce, crust, very tasty. The crust is amazing by the way. Â If you don't go for anything else go for the crust. Â  The only place where this pizza was lacking was the sauce. And that's a problem because there's alot of places where its only sauce and crust because the mozzarella isn't shredded its put on in slices. Â The sauce is very plain. Just tomato basically. Â And I guess thats probably ok for some people but I like a flavorful sauce. Â  The other problem here is that it's very touristy. Â Its worth the trip and it is very good pizza, but not the best. p.s. Â If you want the best pizza ever...got to Elegante's in Brooklyn. p.p.s. I came here a second time and liked it much better, must have been an off night. I will give it a 4.",-1
"UMMMMMM AMY RUTH's FOR DINNER TONIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT UNTIL I DIE!! It may be because I have always had horrible experiences at soulfood restaurants but this has to be the best taste of mama's kitchen cuisine that I have ever had! I ordered the fish, macaroni and cheese and candy yams num num num!!!!!!!! My friend brought me here as a ""GIRL I MISSED YOU"" present (which I take with pleasure) anywho, the moment I looked at my food I thought "" OMG, why does my food have no color?"" It looked so weird to me. THEN I took my first bite and oooo weeeee. Those candy yams mixed in the mac n cheese... WHAT!!! I was in soulfood heaven. I couldn't take the fork out of my mouth fast enough to scoop up some more food. I don't even want to finish this review, i'm about to head there right now. I suggest you do the same.",-1
not really good food. Its good for only Sake.,-1
"So happy this finally came to the west side! Had the pork buns - must get. excellant flavor. The chicken wings can be skipped- you'll get better ones at bon chon. Got the Akamaru modern ramen. Nice flavor, very good. I'll def be back",-1
"Great wood clad cafe right down the block from the Tenement Museum perfect for a late lunch waiting for a tour to begin. Kind and patient waitress helped us make selections of beet salad, warm white asparagus salad (special of the day) and schnitzel sandwich for late lunch accompanied with appropriate Maibock. The special was generously served and so tender for Asp spears half the thickness of a broomstick! Perfectly balanced with lemon dressing. Our dessert was a perfect liquid end to our meal. The walnut schnapps recommendation made our afternoon. Just sweet and potent enough to cap our lunch make us smile out the door. Will return for another meal if given the chance.",-1
Just ordered the Gouda burger and it was great. I'm sure the other food is good as well. Online ordering was easy and fast.,-1
"The Ramen and the pork buns was absolutely delicious , the waiter was supper efficient with his service. Â  Ippudo never make me disappoints. This is the one of my favorite restaurant. If you like Asian small plate dishes and noodle soup,you must go to here. Which is the reason why there is a long wait to seated !",-1
"This place is near where I work, and I've been here many times to hang at the bar with colleagues or have dinner with friends. Â Love the oysters at the bar. Â The norwegian salmon and braised short rib entrees were truly exceptional. Â There are 2 reasons why this place didn't get 5 stars, number one being that they do not allow you to order off the full menu at the bar or in the bar area in the front, and considering how large the bar area is this is kind of annoying. Â The second is, the first 6 months they were opened they had this grilled octopus appetizer that was something out of this world, and I can't beleive they took it off the menu.",-1
Best squares in the world. Â Worth the trip,-1
"A great place to get some of the best foods of NYC. Â The careful preparation and great taste, and for a very reasonable price . it a really good choice , lots of veggie options.",-1
"long waiting! but worth the eait.. for starters we had pan cake balls,the munchkins tasted good i wish it was served with a sweeter sauce instead of lemon sauce i had a very sour tart taste and i guess i like my pancake with a sweeter sauce like maple or chocolate.. i had teh huevos rancheros which was interesting..and my other half ordered scramble eggs which he loved.. our server was super good James! the total of our check was also affordable...good food for good pricing.",-1
"Oh Becco. I am surprised to read to many negative reviews about this place. The service is as good as it gets, the food is classic Italian, and you initially get this variety of bread that is going to knock your socks off. I have to chock up the bad reviews to bad people, because they almost scared me off from going here. Don't listen to the bad reviews, try it for yourself first, you will not regret it.",-1
"The weather was beautiful, and we were looking for a place with outdoor dining. We stumbled across this restaurant because it said it had a garden. The drawback is that the garden is glass-enclosed, which was the only bummer. We got over that though because the garden was so peaceful, with natural lighting, a ton of plants, and rustic brick charm. Made us feel like we were outside. The waitstaff was super friendly. We opted for a selection of cheeses and meats. The cheese and wine selection was terrific. The crusty warm foccacia bread was amazing. We topped off the meal with homemade pecan pie and cappucinos.This was such a peaceful getaway. Made us feel like we were in Europe. We'll definitely be going back.",-1
Great oysters,-1
"I need to come here again. There's just so much to look at and things I want to try. It has all your quality kitchen needs. Plus, an ice cream and chocolate section!",-1
Good food. Nice people.,-1
"Great find for us, just on the edge of Chinatown. Opposite a park and library. Great feel, friendly, relaxing and easy going. We only went there for breakfast but it was so good, we kept going back. Pancakes, eggs, continental options all extremely well presented and tasty. Met some lovely locals too. Loved the round table in the window, people watching was fun.",-1
"Having spent a fair amount of time in Japan and being a big fan of Japanese cuisine this place was a bit of a let down. We went there for a Valentines day dinner expecting it to be amazing (after all it has over 2000 reviews and still 4 stars on yelp, who has that??) and although it wasn't terrible it was just underwhelming. The hostess was incredibly disinterested. The food seemed to be an 'American' take on Japanese food, all the tempura was very heavy and the flavours couldn't be said to be precisely balanced. To be fair we ordered a series of appetizers and didn't try the Ramen which seems to be what this place is lauded for, however after my boyfriend almost regurgitate his oyster, we left feeling less than satisfied.",-1
Wonderful service. Beautiful atmosphere. It's a great price for brunch $15 for eggs Benny plus the free drink was pleasantly shocking for the neighborhood! I recommend this to anymore who appreciates a beautiful atmosphere accompanied with great food.,-1
Still my favorite place for ramen. Always must get the pork bun. Lines are always bad. Unfortunately the lines are justified. Easily the place you bring people from out of town to try ramen in NY.,-1
Service is slow but the food is tasty.,-1
"Perhaps the best know restaurant on 31st Avenue, Astoria and top rated restaurant in Astoria Queens, this gem of a restaurant attracts the young, hip and local food connoisseurs of Queens. Off the beaten paths of Broadway Long Island City or 30th (Grand) Avenue, Astoria, Il Bambino is one of a growing number of trendy restaurants sprouting up on 31st Avenue in Astoria. I have been coming here since 2008, and have lived on 31st Avenue nearly half my life, so I have seen many restaurants come and go. Il Bambino has survived the ups and down of our great recession and bucked the average closure rate for most eateries in NYC. Over the years, the co-owner, Darren Lawless, has worked tirelessly to maintain and run this restaurant at very high level, and this is also reflected in the fact that there has not been much staff turnover recently. You can usually find the same crew ready to serve food or coffee to those who come and go on a regular basis. My favorite is the Prosciutto panini, on the menu. Oh, and did I forget -most items on the menu go for the less than $15 and in many cases less than $10/item. Il Bambino provides outdoor seating, but no scenic view I am afraid, just a view of other apartment blocks and buildings facing 31st Avenue. However, in the summer it is nice to have a beer here with a sandwich. Restaurant is Rated A, but I will give them an A+ for excellence. They are also Zagat rated. Kudos Il Bambino -. KEEP ON COOKIN'",-1
"I know those little phrases that seem so innocuous and, once you let them in, pollute the whole of speech. Nothing is more real than nothing. The Levee rises up out of the pit and knows no rest until it drags you down into its dark. My notes have a curious tendency, as I realize at last, to annihilate all they purport to record. Nothing to be done.",-1
"Went there yesterday to try it out and it was delicious. I was skeptical despite the legion of good reviews. Cmon 5 dumplings for a dollar? They can't be THAT good. Prosperity Dumpling proved me wrong. Not going to say much because pretty much everyone else has said it all. I'm going back later today to get more. I however can't help but think they are using less than desirable meat parts, how else can they sell it for so cheap? Buuuuut I don't care, too good to care.",-1
"Really excellent brunch; both dishes we ordered were very well done: the parmesan biscuits and the polenta with eggs. Â The service was also extremely good, and the coffee hot and refilled. Â My only complaint would be with the space - on a sunny morning for brunch, it's a bit sad to be in a windowless room, pretty as it is.",-1
"I came here for dinner last night. I was pleasantly surprised by the interior layout of the restaurant. It has two levels and interesting woodwork designs. We ordered the Matador since that seemed to be a popular choice. It's a lot of food. It feeds three people comfortably. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The plantains were good; I especially liked the butter/lemon sauce it came with. The salchipaps were mediocre. The fries were soggy and I wish they crisped the sausages. They could've been more generous with the rice/beans. Bottom line, the food is good enough.",-1
The food was great as well as the music. I was dancing and eating at the same time. The service was good as well. You were supposed to have a reservation but they allowed us to sit anyways without a reservation.,-1
"great restaurant and amazing brunch, food always fresh and delicious, perfect for dinner, can't wait to try for lunch. Order gnocchi , they are amazing!",-1
"Better than Chipotle in terms of freshness and value, beef chili had great flavor.",-1
"completely overrated. i went for brunch a couple times cuz my friends insisted, but never really had a good experience. over priced food that can be found anywhere in the city.",-1
Your typical meat packing B & T crowd. Â Not worth the aggravation of trying to justify that you are hear by choice and not that it is or was the place to go. Food is ok. Way overpriced for what you end up with. Â Same with the cocktails. Not my cup of tea. Leave it to the B & T'ers. Â These two deserve each other.,-1
"I love coming to Maialino, whether it's for Sunday brunch or a late night date at the back tables the staff are always responsive to the mood and the only time the food has disappointed me is when they take something I really liked off the menu (*ahem*, Olive Cake!) - then again, what they replace it with always makes this restaurant a venue I want to come back to regularly!",-1
Brunch! Â Everything is great!,-1
The food is simply excellent. Everything is as close to perfect as you can get. The atmosphere was also great and the service was great! I highly recommend.,-1
loveeeeeeee this place.... happy hour is best!! especially on tuesdays with half off tapas!!... the tapas are great!!.... i definitely think i know food and the tapas are VERY good.... especially for half off... Â the mojitos/sangria are strong and great... definitely a great place after work any day of the week!!,-1
"delicious food.... great flavor pairings... fun atmosphere... alive yet very dinner appropriate lighting. Â Try it, I'm sure I will again.",-1
"The lady who evidently thinks she's the boss was just plain rude. So much so that although we live 75ms away, we ain't never going back.",-1
"Yes, the lobster roll is fresh, tender, and delicious. Â There is however one item you should be aware of, the lobster meat is claws only, no lobster tail meat. To their credit the claw meat they use is very tender but its still not tail meat which is what you get in Maine or Mass. This is based on a few visits and also a roll from the Williamsburg booth. Nothing wrong in using just the tail meat but at 16 bucks a roll I would expect at least a mix.",-1
"a bit overrated but never bad. If you walk in a little too late in the evening, before they are about to close the kitchen, or when theyre just not in a great mood, beware. I've always had wonderful service during the day, but I don't appreciate the irritable late night servers. On several occasions, when the bar is busy even, they really like to kick everyone out. I know what it's like to want to get off your shift, but I've never known a bar to be so pushy. The food is fine, but nothing I would crave. The prices are reasonable, the music is excellent. And i do enjoy the decor and bathroom charm. Not a favorite of mine, but hard to find too much fault when its so aesthetically charming.",-1
"Really cute, quaint Park Slope restaurant with about 15 tables in a small, square room. Some of the tables are too close together, and the service is a bit hit or miss (sometimes really quick and friendly, sometimes i Â feel like my waiter has forgotten that we're there). Â  Really, really good organic food. Probably the best mid-priced food in Park Slope. Good for a lazy Friday or Saturday night with family or close friends. Â I wouldn't advise going with big groups because it gets a little cramped and the service starts to slip the bigger the group. Right group size is probably 2 - 4 ppl. Â  Sometimes I feel like their menu is too short, and there aren't enough options from which to choose. There organic brick chicken is outstanding and there meze plate (3 dips and hot pita bread) used to be DELICIOUS, but they discontinued that dish. Not sure why.",-1
"best ramen in north america. most authentic ramen, compared to ramen in japan.",-1
"This place is all in the name - definitely go for the 5 for $1 fried dumplings. Â Everything else is also dirt cheap and tasty, but nothing trumps the fried dumplings (I thought the duck sesame pancakes were a little too greasy and not sauced enough the one time I ventured outside of dumplings there). Â I would however suggest getting the steamed ones if you're taking it to go, and fried if you're planning on eating it within 10 minutes of ordering. Don't forget a hefty dash of the two sauces directing onto the dumplings before you leave the tiny and often cramped room. Â  They also sell 50 frozen dumplings for only $9, meaning many deliciously fast and lazy meals when I'm too lazy to cook/leave my apt/order delivery. Basically, I have a hard time bypassing this place whenever I'm in Chinatown.",-1
"The food is executed well- the service is impeccable and the overall ambiance is warm- if there is a complaint- well- it is pricey. The service was fantastic, very friendly and accommodating. Everything we had on the tasting menu melded together perfectly. Everything tasted very fresh and organic.",-1
love this place.,-1
Good meatballs! Greens are nice too! Try the sliders so you can try a bunch!,-1
"Their food was okay in my opinion. We ordered a pitcher of both red and white sangria. Although both tasted watered down, I preferred the white over red. The Warm Feta, Tomato, Caper, Anchovy, Pepper, Olive, Pita Bread and calamaris were good starters for the table. The chicken pita was good but needed more tzatziki so we ordered a side of it. Â Great food and the price is right.",-1
I brought all my friends here and they all loved it. We do not mind waiting for 45 mins (sometimes an hour) since it is all worth it! Noodles were so tasty - kai dama! Broth was always heavenly! And the pork bun? To die for!,-1
"I've been here a few times and it's always fantastic. The prices are unbeatable, especially for homemade pasta. I usually get the gnocchi with the sage and prosciutto and it's always delicious. The octopus and potato salad is also great. Great food for very little money!",-1
"BYOB. Great food. Great vibe. Great service. Good prices. Cool crowd. What else can one want from a brunch spot? I've been here 10 times. Everything is really tasty and fresh. I've never felt gross from eating anything. Slightly hipster, if ya like that sort of thing.",-1
"I used to love this place madly. Â I went there once a week before everyone discovered it. But while the service remains speedy, the quality has diminished slightly, plus they now play really loud music. Â But the ramen is unparalleled and the green tea/ mascapone desert is outrageously good.",-1
"well.... did I expect too much? after watching Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, I was so eager to go to this place. I ordered the fried chicken with waffle and an homemade ice tea. Annnnnd, oh-oh... the chicken had no moist at all.. very dry so It was hard to swallow. I just want to believe the cook on that day was in a bad condition. Homemade ice tea! I think they shouldn't call it as a homemade... tasted like an artificial flavored soft drink. For the main dish and drink, I should give them two stars.- disappointing! However, I should give them one more star for the donuts! I have to admit that the donuts are amazing!!!!!! I think they have to change the name ""Pies 'N' Thighs"" to "" Pies 'N' Donuts"" something!",-1
yum,-1
"This is my favorite Italian place in Manhattan. Service was good, food was excellent. The sauce was to die for and the thin crispy crust was perfection. The dining room is bigger than it looks, dark, very intimate. It was a great place to relax as the snow was falling outside, put down some pizza and a nice beer. The key here is fresh fresh fresh and a must in the city!",-1
"Nice small place, good for brunch. Â French toast is great!",-1
"I hate any place that does not take reservations. I find it incredibly annoying and unnecessary. The hosts here are also annoying in a condescending/hispter kind of way. Also, the service is bad. The people that work here come off as if they feel like they are saving the world by working here. Other than this, the food is extremely delicious (so much so that it outweighs the bad service/experience otherwise). Obviously the food is very unhealthy, perhaps excessively so- one of those places where there is butter, salt, and fat added to anything and everything. I'm surprised there wasn't a stick of butter in my water. That said, it was one of the best tasting cheeseburgers I have had in my life. It was out of this world.",-1
"THeir black label burger is the best burger I've ever had! Reservations are a must, but there is often bar space + that's good enough for me! Wonderful, helpful staff. The bartenders are the best, the hosts are so lovely! I miss Amandi - she was my favorite!",-1
"these are one of those places where at the most random times of the day/night, you just gotta' have it. drunk or sober, its something that can hit the spot in an instant. chicken and rice on 53rd and 6th. Â the infamous yellow bag. Â long lines, drunk new yorkers and tourists; hungry for some good cheap eats. Â from about 7pm till 4-5am, rain or shine, these guys will be there. Â i think if a freakin' tornado hit new york, these guys would still be standing delivering the goods. its pretty simple when you go, chicken and rice or chicken/lamb and rice. Â if you ask for a sandwich you should just turn around and go to the end of the line and think about what you just did. either platter is six bucks and you can load your dish with bbq, hot, and the white sauce. Â i actually have never had it with bbq sauce, but loads of white sauce and a little bit of hot sauce and you're ready to dig in. Â the hot sauce is really hot so just watch out...you want to be able to enjoy your meal. Â  now lets talk about that white sauce. Â what the heck is in it? Â im a culinary school graduate, and many of my friends have asked me to replicate it. Â i can figure out some of the components but i know i dont have it all. Â ive thought about it quite a bit and i've come to conclude that they use crack cocaine. Â this white sauce is crazy good and you'd be a fool to not put a heck of a lot on. there are only a few negatives about this place...there arent really a lot of places to sit if you want to stay close, the lines can get really long, and lastly, it isnt the most healthy thing to eat. Â i eat this ish once in a while and it fits the bill, but this is something i cant eat on a regular basis. Â so if you're drunk or in the mood for something heavy, this is your spot. Â just eat with caution.",-1
yum yum ! great experience at this place . food was very good .drinks were even better . excellent Mexican spot,-1
"What a great choice! We ordered several dishes to share family-style, and it was such an enjoyable meal. Some of the dishes we ordered:chicken masala, saag paneer, vegetable samosas, and a curry dish, several types of naan, along with a few other dishes. Every dish was freshly prepared and delicious. The staff was attentive and efficient. Our bill was only just over $73.00 for 6 people. And then at the end of our meal, they brought us servings of mango ice cream and pistachio ice cream. It was enough for all of us to share, and both ice creams were smooth, fresh, and delightful. It was a great experience.",-1
"We arrived around 10 on a Saturday night. I expected to have to wait. Instead the 4 of us were seated immediately. It was the night before Easter, maybe that's why? The pizza was great. What was most impressive to me, however, was that when our friends ordered a cheeseless pizza, the waiter didn't bat an eye. And they enjoyed it. The dough and sauce were special enough to make them very happy. So vegans need not shy away from this place. Also,a Â pizza is very reasonable when two are sharing.",-1
"there must be some secret to the jerk chicken's tenderness because it was more silken that any other chicken i've tasted. usually one has to tug at and wrestle with chicken pieces, or at any rate be aware of the sawing required to make bite-sized pieces. this chicken obediently slid of the bone onto my fork and melted quietly in my mouth. Â  the people who run the kitchen are imperious but not in an objectionable way-- they simply have to cater to many eager, hungry mouths and have confidence in their culinary flair. i'll wait in the sweltering heat to get a portion of chicken, i will.",-1
"Balaboosta gets five stars, despite the fact that the food was not perfect (well, one thing was not perfect, but more on that in a second). We sampled a lot of different appetizers, and I also had the skirt steak as a main dish. The falafel meatballs were amazing! I've never had anything like them before, and it's well worth a trip here for these. The chickpea layer gave way to a ground beef center, and the two flavors complimented each other perfectly. Another highlight of the appetizers was the cauliflower. There was a layer of lemon on top of the crunchy cauliflower, which was fried but not too oily. The pine nuts added a nice nutty bite as well. Between the falafel meatballs and the cauliflower, I was in heaven. The one appetizer that I did not love was the hummus. I prefer my hummus very thick and smooth, and the one here was rough, with chunky chick peas on top. It was not seasoned with enough spice or olive oil for my taste. It was, however, incredibly fresh. The skirt steak was delicious too, and I loved the potatoes it was served with. Everything arrived hot. We had malabi for dessert, which tasted like panna cotta. The nuts on top added some nice texture. Our waiters were so nice! We had one waiter, who I think was Assaf, who was super-nice, but then all the other waiters helped out when they could. There was definitely a team effort going on. Everyone was very friendly. It really added to the atmosphere. Usually, every dish has to be perfect for me to give a restaurant five stars, but Balaboosta had that something special, which made me overlook the only dish I wasn't crazy about. The food is super fresh, and it has that pop, that zing!, those unique flavors that are rare to find.",-1
"I love good pizza. In Nj there is some good pizza. At Grimaldi 's in Brooklyn I got some great pizza. Â The line wasn't there, we walked right in, the servers were attentive, and the table relatively clean. Hey in this part of the city, everything is relative. Crust is very important in pizza. This was crisp with a nice thin layer of sauce , bubbling cheese, and just the right touch of spices. The large size was large as in let's take the rest home and eat it for breakfast. Recommend and hope you get the same cook who did our pie- a work of yummy art!!",-1
"Don't really see the big hype about this place. The Food: I thought it was a normal pancake. It tasted to me the same as my home-made aunt jemima pancakes. There's really not much hype about the pancakes or the eggs/bacon. They don't even have a big selection of pancakes, I prefer I-Hop a lot better than this place. (Lost 1 star here) The Staff: Constantly running around, too busy to come up to your table and ask you how everything is. You have to track them down and call them over. I didn't even bother asking my waitress for extra sauce, i asked a dish-washing boy to get me some. But hey, for a really busy place, I don't blame them. The Environment: Very tiny small place. You're literally eating with a bunch of strangers next to you. Not much elbow room. If you're a person who needs their own personal bubble space, this place is not for you. (Lost 1 star here) The Price: Cash only. Seriously? We're in an age of technology and plastic cards and for overpriced food, cash only? That's total bullshit. (Lost 1 star here) The Wait-time: Come here at 11 AM, be seated at 1 PM. That's how long of a wait, they text you when a table is available. Overall, not coming back here again. RATED 2 out of 5",-1

"Lombardi's.. Lombardi's.. Lombardi's...I have heard so many great things about this place yet I was skeptical for so long. Finally I went and I have kept going. I have NEVER liked meatball pizza EVER before. But..there is always a first time and Lombardi's came out tops! The meatballs are soooo tasty, making the pizza even more juicier! My only thumbs down is that the crust is a little too soft!",-1
"I visited Cafe Mogador for brunch one Sunday. The menu has a number of good dishes. The food is very good, with interested Mediterranean-style choices. Like most brunch spots in Williamsburg, the cafe was full of people and had a really upbeat atmosphere. Great experience overall.",-1
"First thing I need to say is as amazing as the duck meatballs, I want to promote the Calamari Salad. It was crisp, tasty, and delightful. My main dish (hanger steak) was good and beautifully plated, but I regret not trying the duck or fish. The chocolate soufflÃ© (WOW-- order it). The salted caramel brownies at the end were a nice treat. I will definitely be going back!! OH -- if you are a group of two, chances are you will sit along the wall and the tables are a bit close together.",-1
I love The Runner! A great addition to the neighborhood. Be sure to order the popovers and the grilled oysters.,-1
"Everything was so delicious and cooked to perfection, and the service was great! The staff were very nice and accommodating about our giant stroller. I would definitely come back here.",-1
"SHOCKED that this place only has 3.5 stars. That is just a sign that us New Yorkers are a little hard to please sometimes! This place is an amazing place with delicious fresh food. Yes, it is crowded, but that just means it is a great find, right? Phenomenal pastas, sauces, and cheeses. Love it.",-1
"The chef stuffs your box like theres no tomorrow that he will rubber band it. Extremely generous with portion and very tasty. Though certainly not the highest quality ingredients you will find, this place is the least expensive and most filling for thousands of miles. Just a lunch box is enough for 2-3 meals. He chops fast and is the only person chopping food so it might be a bit of a wait but definitely worth it. I recommend the BBQ Pork, Chicken Wings, Soy Sauce Chicken and Ginger over the other sauces, though he'll pour those in as well. Go there if you're hungry. It is quite an experience.",-1
yumm,-1
"In my opinion, the service is like trattorias in Rome. I think could be better. Dishes are very well made, with lots of flavor and aroma. The atmosphere is good and quiet place and very central location of many restaurants in the area. The prices are fair. You can check the restaurant's website. I recommend a business meal at noon, Monday through Friday. In conclusion, it is highly recommended. Especially for lovers of Italian food and atmosphere similar.",-1
I can't believe it's taken me so long to find this place. Went there last week and was blown away. Authentic Italian food. Had the risotto with squid ink and thought I was having a heart attack it was so good. I cannot wait to go back.,-1
"Great spot for a date or small groups ... for 3 or less, I recommend sitting at the bar as the chef's sometimes have amuse bouche on offer. Make sure you grab a bottle of wine before you get there - it is BYOB and corkage for your first bottle is nada. Best value sushi restaurant for the quality, especially if you hit up happy hour. Note that they do not take reservations on Friday or Saturday nights.",-1
"I've been to Bianca twice. I had a gnocchi first time. It was good and taste a little bit heavy for me. Also, 2nd times, I got what kind of a pasta, salad with goat cheese and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream etc... But Pasta was terrible;( It was no taste. But other stuff was good.",-1
Excellent Waffles! Â I am still dreaming about them. Â We came here for a brunch and it was the perfect place to get a big fluffy belgium waffle smothered in a variety of wonderful things. Â On the way out I also saw they had a wonderful selection of freshly made salads and mini quiches for lunch. Â I was sorry we couldn't go back.,-1
"I don't think this is the original location of the famous Lombardi's, which claims to be the first pizza restaurant in the whole New York City. Nonetheless, we have been to this Spring street location twice already and each time we loved it! The basil pizza is our favorite. The crust is right on the thickness and texture, not too doughy and quite crunchy! I heard they are very diligent on their water, maybe that's why New York pizza wins out, it's all in the dough!",-1
the pizza is divine,-1
"4 of us ate here and all enjoyed our food which included a Filet Mignon, Chicken Boiled in Vinegar, Grilled Salmon and the Seabass Special. We were unable to eat dessert due to the Portion Sizes which were very large. We enjoyed a lovely bottle of Nero Sicilian Red Wine.",-1
"UPDATED 4/8/14 This place is a chain. There is one that opened first in Brooklyn. I've been here 3x but will definately coming again and update my experience as they will soon be offering lunch menu. FAVORITES - Hibino Teriyaki Chicken $15 (generous with the meat, vegs change) - spicy scallop with roots $5 (tapa option but haven't seen it offered again) - grape veggie juice $3 (21 ingredients) - ice cream sandwich (green tea ice cream, strawberry, red bean) - argula with tofu skin (tapa option) PRO - new $5 tapa options daily - authentic japanese food - high chairs available - fresh fish - nice interior design - got to interact with the one of the chefs CON - inexperienced waitresses Â  Â  * waitress took forever to give the bill. Â  Â  * while we were enjoying our food, waitress would disturb us to walk through the Â  Â  Â  tight aisle when she could have walked through the other aisle. keep in mind we Â  Â  Â  have a stroller Â  Â  * water refill needed to be asked. Â  Â  * I needed to follow up with the waitress to give me my food that I asked to go - not childproof (a young child was sitting on a heavy stool and fell) - not all tapa options were available - many sushi rolls have shiso leaf which i'm allergic to (only spot had it though) - no kids menu - no written dessert menu - no staff says Arigatou gozaimasu/thank you for coming here - only 2 credit cards for 1 group NOTE The crowd seemed like - singles night on Thursday - family night on Friday - couples night on Monday Offers delivery Mon-Fri now. Fried pork entree was a little dry and using flaky bread would have been better.",-1
"I had to visit this restaurant twice for lunch in a week to have the raw fluke, asparagus, radish, and lemon chilli yogurt dressing. I just loved this place! everything is beautiful and it's the best lunch I've ever had. Don't miss out on the mushroom and egg pizza but share it unless you want to fall in a lunch food coma.",-1
"The garden room at this cafÃ© is fantastic. So beautiful. Their specialty is pizza, and it very delicious. They also have a large drink and dessert menu, and everything I tried was excellent. They play jazz music downstairs, and the atmosphere throughout it incredibly close, relaxing, and comfortable.",-1
It has good spicy noodles which is vegetarian...their veggie sesame pancakes are a little odd - fried/baked bread with julienned carrot and cucumber slices and cilantro sandwiched in between two slices. The reason why I didn't give four stars is that the menu is quite limited for vegetarians...no veggie dumplings available. But I thought the service was friendly and my lunch cost $5. Though it is so cheap I don't know if that is good or bad. It is not a dirty establishment at all and those who have written so before prob have a different view on what is clean. It is just a basic dumpling shop.,-1
"I love their Chives And Pork Fried Dumplings. They are cheap and good. Don't go to dumpling house which is very close to prosperity dumpling. The dumpling house is more expensive and not that good. However, when I bought their frozen Chives And Pork Fried Dumplings and cooked them home, I have noticed how much fat came out of them, and it was too oily to eat. I guess I need to know a better way of cooking them or try boiled one.",-1
Everything about this restaurant is perfection! Good cheap food and great service.,-1
"I haven't had popovers since I left the UWS 15 years ago!! Great service and excellent food. This is the area's best option right now, and one of the best new restaurants to open.",-1
"Really nice people, great atmosphere and really good food. It ranges from good to excellent.",-1
"I wanted to like The Pines because of the concept, antique interior, and location, but the initial smell when walking into the restaurant should have been a sign that the experience would be bad. Â The place smelled like a bathroom. Â The restaurant is over priced. Â I think we left the restaurant feeling like we had spent 100 alone on bread (because our entrees and share plates were so disappointing). Â The drinks also could have been better. Â  The oxtail cappellacci was mediocre. Â I know it gets many good reviews online (probably by reviewers who get comped meals) but anyone who I have talked to who has been there said they were also really disappointed. Â We also had the wagyu culotte steak - this dish was incredibly disappointing. Â In this case the rare steak was not done correctly and after sending it back to be cooked more it was actually edible. Â I appreciate the effort to have the other featured ingredients with the steak but they didn't work (part of the reason I ordered the dish is I love mushrooms). Â  Our share plate was so forgettable and not very well put together. Â I remember that the share plate had almost as much bread as the bread plate. Â To be fair, I went here a few months ago but was really so disappointed with it. I heard through friends the only reason one would want to go is the backyard to drink but that the food is not worth your time and money. Â The Pines is definitely overhyped and part of an overhyped wave of new overpriced restaurants taking over brooklyn, manhattan, etc. that we are force fed reviews by young freelancers who wil write a good review for anyone who comps them a meal. Â For a regular person who has to pay for their own meal (or makes the mistake of going here on their birthday like I did) - I would highly suggest skipping it and going elsewhere.",-1
"This place rocks, fast service, great atmosphere, EXCELLENT FOOD!",-1
Pizza and sides are outstanding! Â Great service! Â Love the bartender.,-1
"Ok so whats not to love about this meatball mecca? Â Nothing! Â From the dÃ©cor, to the hip staff, to the knock your socks off meatballs. The only person who is not gonna enjoy this place is a vegetarian(no offense intended) They have ""naked"" meatballs with no bread. Â They have heros and have single sliders. Â you choose from meats:(chicken, pork, beef) and then choose a sauce and then a cheese Heaven:) Also excellent are $2.00 pints of Blue ribbon and to top it all off excellent Ice Cream!",-1
Best pork belly in town! Â Service was great - knowledgeable/friendly staff,-1
soooooooooooooooooooooo good. hopefully all the other cheepskates would not go back here and add more to this the lines here.,-1
Amazingly fresh and delicious food. Â Attentive service without being intrusive.,-1
"This place is named for its main offering, the tarte flambee, which is the thinnest crust delicacy ever! We ate here twice, and the light, delicious main course felt more like a dessert. Try the traditional or the veggie and make sure to get the emmental cheese. Splurge and the top of the tarte menu will run you $13. (Other meals are more costly, but still cheap by NY standards--and Monday is half-price beer, Tuesday half price on bottles of wine) The wait staff was charming and efficient, the floors and tabletops clean, and the overall atmosphere quaint and inviting.",-1
Always a good place ! Good food and impeccable service.,-1
Five star for a great meal and experience! no matter what other will say. and please whoever will give them a one or two or even three stars does not knwo anything about food...,-1
"So disappointed with the food and service. The food is really basics, nothing imaginative or interesting. Not enough vegetarian option, the bartender ignore me the majority of the time. This was my first and last time.",-1
"I can also say great things about this restaurant. i went with the Park Slope Dinner Club, a group of friends that gather and enjoy the great food in our neighborhood and all of us were amazed. The highlight for me was the cocktail - one of the very best I have ever had. The fish was also stupendous. And the service superb. There are a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions between us and the they were super accommodating and flexible. The only thing not positive that I can say was that the restaurant got very loud and at times it was hard to hear over the din. That said, with such great atmosphere, food, and spirits who really needs conversation?",-1
Pros: - Â atmosphere - Â presentation of food - price - food Cons: - service (took forever to order hence 4 out of 5 stars,-1
"our visit to Balthazar was very memorable, escargot was my favorite along with the steak au their wine list is great.... try to get a reservation...",-1
"This place, by far, has the best vietnamese pork sandwiches. Â Their sandwiches are huge and filled with a hell lot more inside than those small, dingy vietnamese sandwiches at other places. Â And it's only $3.75! Â I can't speak for anything else on their menu since I only order their pork sandwiches (I get it spicy to have that extra kick), but I'm sure their other stuff is just as good seeing as how yummy their pork sandwiches are.",-1
"they used to so good but not anymore! where is the best sushi in the city? no azabu, no 15east....",-1
The food was delicious! Its service was alright.,-1
"Stumbled on this amazing place!! Had an excellent breakfast!! Wonderful staff, great food, great atmosphere!!! The Grandma Pizza was AMAZING. Such a simple type of pizza, but everything about it was delicious. I loved the crunch of the batter/crust, and really enjoyed the yummy sauce. Not too much tomato, not too much garlic - just enough of both. There wasn't too much or too little of anything. Somehow they got it right! I was also thankful for them warming it up! Best New York pizza I've had so far. Definitely going back.",-1
"Ah, Eataly. The holy mecca of all things Italian located in New York City. Eataly is one of my favorite destinations in New York. Located on 23rd and Park by the Flatiron, Eataly is a massive portal of Italian food counters, delis, supermarkets, and numerous restaurants. The first time I walked into Eataly (before knowing anything about it) I walked into the entrance where they serve gelato. Completely naive, I started wandering towards the back as I saw swarms of people, wondering what on earth they were all doing, in what I seemingly thought was a tiny gelateria. As I continued to walk back, and the space continued to open up, and I saw more people, and the noise volume grew. I felt like a little kid in the M&M store in Times Square. The NY Eataly is designed after the superstore located in Turin, Italy. Eataly offers a bakery, a butcher counter, seafood, fresh pasta, dry pasta, every cheese under the sun, hundreds of olive oils and vinegars, a massive selection of dairy, fresh produce, and so much more... In addition to the markets and counters, there are 7 restaurants in Eataly. Yes, seven. Each of the restaurants are located next to the fresh market that provides its ingredients. I have had the glorious pleasure to have eaten at La Pizza & Pasta, and Birreria. Kyle and I went on a Saturday to La Pizza & Pasta and waited for about an hour. The plus side to the wait is you can walk around and explore (and spend money on imported Italian goods). It's bustling with people, a bit cramped, but the smell alone, of the authentic Italian flavors and fresh buffalo mozzarella melting onto the pizza in the oven nearby, makes it all worth it. We started out with wine, served with fresh bread from the bakery and olive oil, a deep golden yellow, almost green. The greener the oil, the better the oil. The olive oil at Eataly is phenomenal--fruity, a bit salty with an overall deep, earthy flavor. The bread is served in a paper sleeve, piping hot out of the oven. We started with the San Marzano pizza- a Margherita pizza. Authentic. Simple. The cheese is fresh and creamy, drizzled with their olive oil, and the crust is buttery, slightly crispy and not too chewy. It sent me right back to Florence. The pies ranges from $9 to $18 - surprisingly reasonably priced, and great for sharing. We then couldn't resist trying another pie (oops) and ordered the Quattro Formagio (my favorite while in Italy, so I had to try it here). With mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmigiano, and cacio cavallo, this pizza is something that I cannot even try to describe. You've got to go and try it for yourself. Â Two pies are perfect for two hungry people (with maybe a few leftover slices that will be great thrown in the oven the next day). My second experience at Eataly, was with my friends Liz, Gaby and Jules. Birreria is Eataly's rooftop restaurant, specializing in house-brewed beer and Italian food with a twist. It was a warm summer night, getting closer to Fall. There was a slight cool breeze making it enjoyable outdoor dining. The rooftop looks out onto Flatiron and all the tall buildings surrounding Madison Square Park. Â We started with the Formaggi sample (you can choose either 3, 5 or 7 of the cheeses) for our first appetizer. We of course choose the sampler of 7, for the 4 of us to share. The plate arrived with Ricotta, Parmigiano, Asiago, Robiola Bosina, Tallegio, and Gorgonzola. Each one is unique. Served with hot bread, oil and honey, it's the perfect appetizer to share! We also ordered the meat plate (deep apologies for not having a picture, it was devoured quickly) to accompany the cheese, which included a sampling of Speck, Sopressata, Mortadella, Cacciatorini, and Coppa. The Sopressata and Cacciatorini were my favorite. My other favorite at Birreria (and also one of my favorite appetizers of all time) are the Shiitake Fritti Con Salvia. I intensely crave this appetizer regularly. Whoever thought of deep frying mushrooms was an absolute genius, and I'd like to personally meet them and thank them myself. A heaping portion of hot, fried shittake mushrooms with sage. Perfectly crispy, crunchy and salty, with the warm, tonal flavors of the mushrooms. Last, we ordered the Pork Shoulder, braised with their homemade beer, celery, local apples, and mustard vinaigrette. Creamy, tender, and flavorful. Birreria is perfect for any occasion with anyone. Delicious food and fantastic beer. The beer I got was a special, that I can longer find on the menu. It was slightly hoppy, with delicious summer flavors of apple and pear. Eataly is sure to thoroughly impress anyone you take. I recommend La Pizza & Pasta for a weekend lunch, and Birreria for dinner. It's an epic experience you don't want to miss. Also, if you're wondering, Eataly also has a bookstore and offers food classes.",-1
"It is an amazing place if you are going to eat Korean food! I went there this morning with my friends and we both loved what we ordered. The design is amazing, which reminds me of Korean traditions and the service over there is absolutely wonderful! It's a little bit hard to find but it's definitely worth the effort.",-1
"I previously wrote a review and gave Lamarca four stars. I'm now giving it ONE star. Why, you ask? Because I found out that they use Barilla pasta. I saw an entire stash of all sorts of Barilla pastas in their shelves behind the counter. They are royally ripping the customer off! You can buy Barilla pasta at the grocery store for pennies on the dollar, and they charge you the very expensive price of $7.05 for a bowl at the cafe. (Where the hell did they come up with the idea to charge the extra nickel, anyway? It's just fucking irritating for the customer if you don't have a nickel with you, and then you have to keep 95 cents worth of change in your pocket the whole day). They must be making a FORTUNE ripping their customers off! Please, please, PLEASE, do NOT go to this horrible restaurant who are knowingly ripping their unsuspecting customers off! That is, unless you like bending over and being raped with high prices for the same generic Barilla pasta you KNOW you can purchase at the grocery store for under $2 for an entire bag of pasta! SPREAD THE WORD SO EVERYONE WILL KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT LAMARCA AND RIPPING THEIR CUSTOMERS OFF!",-1
"Philippe Massoud has a story to tell at Ilili (which means tell me). Ilili is a high end, contemporary Lebanese restaurant, located in the Flatiron district. Massoud's culinary tales are woven into the nouveau Lebanese cuisine he's created that draws on his beginnings in hospitality in Beirut and experiences that followed suit in the United States. The space is expansive. There is a funky lounge area, a large dinning area, several private rooms and a DJ to set the mood. One would really expect to find this kind of place in the Meatpacking District. The brunch at Ilili, which was recently introduced, pairs classic American offerings with a Middle Eastern twist. These inventive combinations present a great alternative to traditional brunch dishes. It is priced at $25 for a cocktail and two courses from the brunch menu. Dessert is not included but definitely worth trying. I'm going to go back to try out their lunch and dinner deals for sure. Everything we tried ranged from good to very good. So, if you are looking for something a little different to do on a weekend morning...mosey on down to Ilili for brunch and tell them that the Restaurant Fairy sent you along for some good eats.........",-1
The panini here was delicious and the staff here was great. The service was impeccable. We were seated within a minute of our arrival. The wine they had was also really good. I loved pretty much ever aspect of this place. I'll definitely be back again.,-1
Once a month my younger cousin and I have a Dinner PlayDate. The ambiance was very nice. The food was delcious. The staff was very hospitable. I would reccomend this location for autentic Indian cuisine.,-1
"Last year after going to the Roseland Ballroom for the Halloween Bash with my friend John- we heard about this place from Jeanne's friends. (she was the one that convinced us to go to Roseland Ballroom) After leaving Roseland, Jeanne's friends offered to take us back home. Â When we were in their car, they were raving to us about this place that's just a cart. Â They kept on saying how good it was and we got to try it. John is such a laid back character--- he gets all excited about the food too! Â So John and the rest of them ended up getting out to wait in that ridiculous line - John asked if I wanted anything. Â I told him I'll pass since I wasn't hungry. The driver and I sat in the car and waited for them. Â During the wait we saw two Indian guys approached this one Indian guy while he was waiting in line. Â I guess these two Indians were trying to start some mess with this one Indian dude. Â All of sudden that one Indian dude's friends all came out of no where. Â There were about 18 of them against these two Indian fellas. I guess since they were outnumbered, these two guys ended up backing away and got into their get away rickshaw. Â Yes, I said RICKSHAW---not a get away car but a damn Rickshaw. The 18 wanna be gangstas---they shouted after them while the two dudes in the Rickshaw shouted back saying they will get them soon. First of all, I found it to be HILARIOUS and Second, they are bunch of posers! Â If they really wanted to do something, they could have done something - They are just bunch of children! After that a whole fiasco, they all came back into the car. John ordered this large order of the Chicken Platter and they got him so excited about the food. I swear that boy gets excited about everything - he's so crazy! They ended up taking us back to my place where John ate his food - I just had a bite from his order. Â It was good, but it wasn't so freaking good like how they were describing it nor did it taste so good that I couldn't stop eating it. I ate one bite and that's it! John, who was all excited about it - was no longer excited about it anymore. He thought the same thing as me. However, I am glad that I got to try it and I enjoyed watching the show down while I waited for them.",-1
"If possible, I would give 3 1/2 stars. Nothing wrong with the place or food but since I've given 4 stars to better places it seems a little exaggerated to give 4. Had late breakfast / lunch with friends. The mac & cheese we tried was Yummy!",-1
"We went here for brunch, and it was really a lovely experience. Our server was very nice and helpful, and the food was great. Squid ink was amazing and the steak.... we debated whether it was sous vide or not and the winner was me. It was cooked so well - pink color throughout made you think it was sous vide BUT it wasn't! For dessert, we had the pistachio cake (not as moist for my taste) but the plum sorbet was divine. I'm so glad I gave Locanda Verde another try, and I will definitely be coming back for another brunch!",-1
Happened upon this bar by accident while exploring the city. Its a very quiet dark and romantic bar with a cozy bar and a few tables. It feels like there should be a little hidden back room or something. The Â beer selection was fun and the Bartender seemed to know who to engage and who was there to be left alone. Something I appreciate!! I would say its not good for groups but rather to take someone you want to share a pint with and hold hands under the table.,-1
"Dined here with a big group and we all had a great time there. Â The decor kept it warm but at times it was a bit too dark. Â The food was very good, the ribs just came off the bone, no mess. Â The waitress was very patient with our group and gave good recommendations. Â It's a bit pricey though.",-1
they used to sooo good i went to 3 days ago in a long time it was awful! no energy or great wait stuff or even food.. so sad,-1
Treated myself to some good ol' soul food chicken and waffles. Waffle and chicken were both crispy and flavorful. The service was a little off. i had 2 different waiters for no reason. It would have been awesome if they weren't both so slow and confused.,-1
Love the high ceilings and ambiance.,-1
picklicious good! Â The fried pickles were worth the trip to Astoria. Â Many people may not know this but there is an art to fried pickles. Â Sweet Afton has figured out the perfect combo of batter to pickle ratio using a perfectly tart pickle - add in a spicy mayo dipping sauce..yummy. Â Im a bit of a wuss when it comes to cocktails. Â They have a dirty pickle martini which was like pickle infused vodka - I think I would have enjoyed it more mixed with tonic only cause as I said i'm a bit of a wuss and it was too strong for me. Â The bar tender was super friendly as was the wait staff. Â They were crazy busy and were still all smiles.,-1
"i don't understand all the hype. i went here with a group of seven for a friends birthday dinner and i have never been so disappointed in what i thought was for sure to be an excellent meal. i would like to say maybe we got the wrong thing but we got everything. the soft shell crab sandwich was whatever, the brick chicken was a far cry from being worth 22 bucks, coulda made it myself, the halibut was bland and then friends got the potato tortilla, goat cheese croustini and some kind of chick pea ragu? i didnt try them but they seemed underwhelmed. anyways, it was all so so. it was not worth the money, i understand this is brooklyn and i am more than willing to shell out my money for a good meal but for crying out loud, get off your high horse and if you're not going to make the food better then lower the prices. Â the whole experience was a flop. luckily we found a bar close by with cheap drinks to drown our sorrows.",-1
"The have a very nice, low key atmosphere. We met friends we have not seen in several years for dinner at Bistango and had a great time. The food was excellent and service was top notch. The prices were very reasonable. For gluten free they had warm gluten free bread and a very varied menu. I had the following gluten free items- pizza, calamari, cheese tortellini in a cream sauce, and a warm apple tart with ice cream......fantastic. I will head back to Bistango.",-1
"Great mac n cheese, like that its open 24 hrs, cool vibe inside",-1
"The restaurant is really highly rated, but I think it was good but not great. The service is excellent, and so is the ambience, but I was not blown away by the food, as the menu is more trendy than traditional. The portions are small, and the wine list is heavy on the French wines, and it is expensive to dine there.",-1
"I've been eating here for about 20 years. Â The crab meat and pork soup dumplings are pretty reliable and usually pretty good. Â The other options on the menu, however, are spotty. Â Double cooked pork is usually decent. Â When soft shell crab is in season, it's worth getting. Â Other than that, there's not much to recommend. Â The main reason I go now is because my son loves the soup dumplings.",-1
Love this little place! Steak salad with avocado is awesome and so is the polenta dish. It's very small though so if you come on a weekend night be prepared for a wait. The wine selection could also use some improvements but the mojitos and caipirinhas are solid. Way to go!,-1
"so so good. Â as with other reviewers, conflicted between telling others about it for fear of lucali-esque lines forming. Â so it sucks. Â go away.",-1
"the only thing i hate more than having to write a bad review is this restaurant. Â really, really bad. i did take out last week and have not stopped thinking about how awful it was. Â i just don't get why this place has such a good reputation. Â i got raw squid in the squid salad, really yucky, soupy, tofu and vegetables, and, unbelievably, rice that just sucked.",-1
Great pizza..well worth the trip!,-1
Great meat and beer. So-so sides. Be sure to ask for extra rolls!,-1
Wonderful pizza! Must eat here.,-1
"Looking for a killer breakfast? Head on down to The Clinton St. Baking Company and join the crowds of people who wait on endless lines for buttermilk biscuits and pancakes that can only be made by hands that are divine. The space is tight and lines are long but once you slide in and are served........I promise you pure bliss awaits. Clinton St. Baking Company offers a wonderful variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner dishes - everything here tastes so darned good. If you want to skip the lines I suggest going at off-peak hours - they do serve breakfast all day.They also have all kinds of yummy looking baked goods. Clinton St. Baking Company seems to have the perfect recipe for doing everything - just right!you.",-1
"It's rustic, cosy and fashionable all at the same time. It was a busy day, we ended up moving tables from outside to inside without a fuss despite the wait staff clearly under pressure. Our meals were great - pancakes given the thumbs up, huge generous serve and two of us enjoyed the five leaves burger.. to be picky, the beetroot relish was just beetroot slices but overall a delicious Aussie inspired burger. Truffle chips extra naughty and subtle in flavour. I'd return.",-1
"Always on point, one of the best deals in the city. Â I always look for good restaurants and only write about the ones i enjoy. Â Food and service are always the same.",-1
I went for the first time with my girlfriend and loved my whole experience. It had a very traditional setting. Great place for dates or business meetings. The food was very fresh and made just right.,-1
"I really like this place to sip some coffee, eat a bite and work on my computer when I need to get out of my apartment. Â I've sat here for hours before, and never felt rushed or like I was taking up much needed space. Â Nice decor. Â The food is fine- good, tasty cafe food; the breakfast sandwich is really good. Â My experience with the service has been great! Â Whenever I've gone it's not too busy and I go to the bar and order, then either sit at the bar or sit at another table. Â I haven't expected full table service, but maybe they do it, I dunno. Â The people are really nice. Â If it was closer to my apt I'd be back more regularly. Â  I do wish they had espresso, though.",-1
Amazing fresh never frozen (unlike mamas empanadas). Great place for empanadas!,-1
"I hade the pork belly buns, I enjoyed them very much!",-1
"Upon hearing such great publicity for a small, Brooklyn pizza joint, I was giddy with excitement to try Di Fara's pizza. Unfortunately, what was supposed to be the highlight of my NY pizza experience ended up being a disaster. Thankfully, we got to Di Fara when there wasn't much of a line. Dom was there, making the pies, but our $28 classic (cheese) pizza came out very burnt. Â The burnt crust overpowered the rest of the flavors, making it difficult to even eat the pizza. If there was any of Dom's buffala mozzarella on the pizza, we sure couldn't see or taste it, which was also a disappointment. The only distinction Di Fara's earned was the freshly-cut basil, a good way to enhance the flavor of the pizza. Sadly, I must say that I will not be returning to Di Fara's -- There are plenty of better pizza joints in New York City.",-1
"I went here about a year ago and I'm pretty sure my body is still trying to digest the pork. Â  Starts off fine, if you can stand the uber-hip vibe and long wait at the bar. The beer was cheap. As in it makes no sense for Manhattan cheap. Ah, the next round was double the price. Wuh ? Turns out it was half price happy hour when I first arrived. No notice from the bartender that if we order in the next five minutes we can get the deal before the price goes up. Thanks. Probably I wasn't cool enough to receive the message. But the pork buns ordered while hunkering down for the long table wait were excellent. Note the word pork. It will come back to haunt me. Table in some room straight back then left and then left again. So what to eat. Pork the waiter suggests. Some soup with pork in it. And add in some extra belly fat while you're at it. OK. And so it goes. I think I heard a pig screaming in the kitchen at one point during my meal. Dessert. What ? No pork Ice Cream. Disappointing. I kept it all down which was a triumph. Order with some more discretion than I and you may have a fonder memory. Me, I may never eat pork again. And if I do it won't be here.",-1
The best ramen in the city. The broth is very rich in flavor and the noodles are always cooked perfectly. It's great to have on a nice breezy day. I always find myself coming back to Totto when I'm in the mood for ramen. The only negative aspect of Totto is that it's a hole in the whole tiny little place with a long line. Since this is an issue I always go early to sign in and grab some drinks with a friend in the area. Great place. Absolutely worth 5 stars.,-1
"Hard to get here-not near any subways but worth the extra effort-when you walk in you're impressed by the chic, modern yet still cozy atmosphere. Amazing food and very chic romantic spot. Recommend the salmon-excellent drinks as well.",-1
"Recently discovered this gem, had gone here once with a friend and I couldn't remember their exact location but I remembered the aliens on the wall lol and amazing salads. I googled some keywords like ""alien decor vegatarian"" and ta-da!! After a few quick looks found the address to this lovely place. I could eat everything on the menu, best part-they're all healthy!!!!",-1
"OOTW W Ran into my doppleganger here, sat very close to him even. Â We both had the same dark brown to black colored hair parted on our person's right side over to the left, scruffy/cool style beards, blue cotton/denim blend button down shirts, jeans, and desert boots - I think he was older which was one of the only differences; I couldn't figure out if he looked young for his age or I was looking older that night. Â Later on we crossed paths heading up and downstairs to the bathroom (i was walking up while he was coming down) we made eye contact but said nothing. Â We were sitting almost back to back at two tables near the door, I can't be sure but i'd imagine we were having pretty similar conversations with our fellow diners. I'm not sure if I'll go back here.",-1

"The flavors are wonderful, vibrant, fresh, and balanced. Simple but really well-done! Also friendly staff and quaint atmosphere. Simple food done extremely well with clean flavors. The service is impeccable. The after-meal chocolates are the perfect after-meal treats. Can't wait to come back again!",-1
"A very good standby when you have guests in town - a celebrity chef name and very nice servers. Â The salads/appetizers are fine, but the $23 pasta special is a nice change and there are likely to be at least two pastas you want second helpings of...Cramped space and yes, I did see a small bug crawling on the wall (it is on the bottom floor of a townhouse in the theater district restaurant row after all)...",-1
"If you can stand the lines, or get there when it isn't crowded, the Halal Guys is absolutely delicious! For $6-8, you get a big plate of rice, lettuce, and perfectly cooked schwarma meat or falafel. This is not only how food stands should be done, but how middle eastern food should be done in this city. Not to mention, the guys are very nice, and will make your food any way you want it. Yeah, the lines are long, but the lines are long for a reason.",-1
"Love it! Been coming here for years. This is a very popular place, and with good reason. Cheap and delicious! Get the Spicy Noodles or some of their Coconut Curry! Only issue we ever have is with the service. Service can be really spotty sometimes even when it's not very busy. Some days it's good, some day's it's hilariously bad. Be prepared to have to hunt down your waiter sometimes. All in all, for the price, the food and the atmosphere - I will keep coming back year after year! Oh, and don't forget: CASH ONLY!",-1
The First time i bit into DBBQ's Ribs.....i understood life. everything made sense. loool..I am convinced that the ribs are actually Unicorn ribs because they are OUT.OF.THIS.WORLD!....ok yeah...the wait sucks..but that's like any good places in the city. but man...what an experience..i honestly don't remember the taste of the brisket etc..the RIBS just did it for me. The only thing where they lose the Star is the BEANS...the Beans are not on the level of everything else! they tasted like canned beans honestly...i was a lil' surprised..but anyways everything else was perfect. Best Ribs i've tasted in my life...next time am getting a FULL RACK for myself. don't care if i pass out. i don't caaarre lol. ok enough.,-1
"The food here was amazing! The prices were just as amazing. My friend and I went here to eat one day on our lunch break, and we got back to work 1 hour late! I will be back.",-1
"The best sushi in all of manhattan. freshest, best tasting.. and you must reserve a seat at the Bar with chef Shoji, thats my guy...i always order sushi and sashimi. yum yum.",-1
"Best margarita I've ever had: fresh lime juice, low sugar. Â Tacos are all interesting and yummy. Â I prefer the corn tortillas. Â Not happy with the lines and waiting, but when 2 cooks have to serve 20 people, what can you expect? Â The owners are cool, the prices are good! Go!",-1
"Love is a many-splendored thing, It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring, Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living, The golden crown that makes a man a king. Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still, Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing, Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing. Some of you may know that I have a big fat crush on Frankie Sinatra, and his song really hits home on the allure of La Sirene. It's softly-lit yet energetic, makes you feel like a king (particularly the rustic game-eating, wine swilling French sort of king) and after an evening cloistered in the cozy beating heart of this restaurant you'll simply want to stroll Soho singing, it's a many-splendored thing! Perfect for a date, an intimate group or even a friendly catch up - this BYOB place serves up delicious, simple dishes with a decadent flair. Not to mention a 3-course Early Bird prix fixe before 7pm for ~ $26.",-1
"We had a wonderful dinner in this lovely restaurant in Soho : the cook is very careful with the quality of the food. We loved the tenderloin and the kassoulet. For dessert, we ate some delicious profiteroles with chocolate sauce.",-1
"what a refresh surprise. Thanks for yelp app. we found this place ! It's very spacious place with an entry way to lounge/bar area. the dinning area has two big rooms. unique bathrooms. This place is a total package! It's a tapas style middle eastern food, lots of small dishes but delicious. we had 4 people and probably ordered everything from the appetizer menu. I definitely enjoyed every bits of it it's not a very noticeable place. no sign or anything. it's a hidden treasure !!",-1
"order from here, because if you order from... Jackson Hole, 3rd Ave. Â after a couple of bites, i found a HAIR in it!!!!! Â  this is probably one of the most disgusting things you can expect in your delivery. Â After speaking with MIKE the MANAGER, he was LESS than helpful. Â I doubt that was even his real name. Â Mike, i hope you rcve the same pleasant experience when you order dinner for your own family. Â TRUST ME MIKE the MNGR, we will meet and speak to discuss further.",-1
"f you're craving for some greasy, artery clogging chicken then look no further. We ordered the chicken and bbq ribs. Both which were juicy, tasty and quite good for the price. If there's a line when you walk in the door, then you know it's good!",-1
"This is one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants. Â My husband and I love their brunch - all their food is fresh, flavorful and delicious. Â I particularly am a fan of their crepes - the edges are crispy and the actual crepe is light and delicious. Â It can be a little bit loud and crowded, but the ambiance is generally cozy and inviting.",-1
Overrated overpriced,-1
"Ok this place is so underrated. The service is attentive. The food is flavorful, fresh and made to order so it's not a drive thru people! Â Geez! Â So our table of three had the crab cake, lamb lollies, grilled stuffed calamari ( a special), fried calamari, kangaroo tacos, fish tacos and prawn tacos. So what's the problem? Â We're growing boys and we love to eat and they did not disappoint. I have not had fish tacos this good since I had them in Ventura, CA at Spencer Mackenzie's. They are really quality. The kangaroo was really tasty too as was everything else. I'm an uber fan and will be coming back for more. Â Last thing is I'd recommend a reservation on the weekends.",-1
"BYOB, tiny adorable no frills french bistro... delicious yet simple food. Â be prepared to sit on top of people, but its a cozy intimate place for a dinner with a friend in the most adorable part of town.",-1
My husband and I showed up at 3:30 on a Sunday & were able to get a table immediately. We both ordered the salmon Benedict.... It came out quickly but our plates were very different. Mine had half the amount of salmon on it. And neither Benedict had much hollondaise sauce on it. I told the waitress & she listened & just walked away. She brought more salmon & hollondaise. But never said sorry about that or anything. The problem was fixed but kind of odd. The eggs Benedict were tastey. Home fries were good. The only other negative is the brunch drinks are pricey. They don't reflect the atmosphere or food prices. I would have ordered cocktails if they had been reasonably priced. FYI this is coming from a former waitress.,-1
"Good, but not my fave Greek restaurant. Food is very fresh and elegant, Â but ever so slightly bland. I'm not sure what was missing, just hint more of seasoning or something. Having said that, we did enjoy everything we ate, but have had better. The complimentary pita is fresh and delicious, but the chickpea spread is bland. Dolmades were very good Â as were the dips. I'd pass on the cold pepper stuffed with cheese. Bass entree with pistachio crust was great, very fresh and delicate. But again, just a tad bland. I wasn't crazy for the spinach, celery veg that accompanied it. Service was friendly and professional. Atmosphere is lovely and great for a date. Good food that lacked bit of magic.",-1
"I went here a few times with my mom to get pho. It was very tasty and the proportions were great. Just as importantly, the food here is very reasonably priced (unlike in Manhattan). I'm not a huge fan of Vietnamese food actually, but I usually make it a point to come to this place when I am craving Vietnamese food. I want to get the kakuni banh mi next time I come here, which will probably be very soon as I've gotten further encouragement from all the other great Yelp reviews for this place.",-1
"Soup is OK. I ordered Chicken Soup, I read the review and I thought it would be in a good portion of the soup. It turned out that it's a really small bowl. You cannot even consider it as an appetizer. The appetizer was OK. The soup tasted great but was too small. The service was great and our server was wonderful.",-1
It is the first Australian restaurant in Astoria (the first one I know of ) .the food is really good .my favorite on the menu is the fish tacos . The place is cute,-1
"I really just love this place. It is tiny, understated and just plain good. The chicken liver app is amazing and such a huge portion. Also got the pasta with seafood, which was so good. Large portions and extremely cheap. Great place to go with friends for a casual dinner.",-1
Soooooo much food!!! Dont know where to begin... The pizza was great as were the fresh pasta... But my fav is the lavazza coffee bar,-1
"Very usable web site; changes daily and includes specials. Have only been here for late lunch on a slow day, but was very impressed and plan to return. Waiter was unobtrusively attentive; burger was very tasty and chicken was high quality; prices were reasonable, and interior was new, comfortable, very clean and left us wanting to come check this place out on a busy night! (we hear there's a club upstairs too)",-1
"The space occupied by The Spotted Pig is decently furnished but hardly anything memorable. It at times reminds me of a generic Paul Smith location. At the door, I was ignored until one of the rude staff members noticed me and directed me to a table. Although there were plenty of tables available, he showed me to a tiny one located right in front of the kitchen (and hence uncomfortably noisy). Over the course of the meal, I came to the conclusion that the Spotted Pig only hires employees who are slow, surly, and seemingly hard of hearing. Service was, in other words, absolutely atrocious. I ordered the chargrilled burger & shoestring fries because that is what they're supposedly known for. It arrived after 40 minutes and was not at all impressive. The meat tasted funny and the fries were almost impossible to eat (a mess). Leaving most of the burger untouched, I paid the tab and could not be happier to leave. In a nutshell-- don't believe the hype and STAY AWAY!",-1
"Il Corallo is the kind of neighborhood gem you start to think doesn't exist in Manhattan anymore, overrun as it is with trendy/foodie/crazies. A clean, well-lighted place, in Hemingway's phrase -- with lovingly prepared main courses as well as pastas and pizzas. Somebody should probably tell them they're not charging enough. What a find.",-1
"Went here last night. At around 9.15pm it was a 30min wait for a spot at the bar for 2. I've been wanting to go here for years and finally was in the neighborhood and decided to pop in for a small bite. Had the long island fluke from the raw bar. It was very interesting with the kumquat had a salty yet sweet taste to it at the same time. After that had the smoked ham, something with a b but not benton, which was delicious. This was my favorite dish that evening. Yet, it tasted great but only got 2 slices of bread even though the plate comes with about 15 slices of ham, we had to ask 3 times to get more bread but only got 2 more slices then. This was a bit odd. Then I had the sirloin tartare which we both didn't like at all. It was still frozen and you had to mix it in with the egg and onion chip pieces as well as some sort of creme fraiche/mayo. I guess, since I love steak tartare I was envisioning something completely different. Also the house sake wasn't too exciting. All in all, it was great to have been here, however service lacked attention to detail. Our waiter failed to ask us whether we wanted any drinks with our food, so we didnt get them until we were eating the 3rd course after several attempts of placing our drink order. Then the place is crazy loud. It was hard to understand your own word. Overall, I would not go back but still want to try Momofuku Ko.",-1
After reading all the great reviews on Yelp. I decided to try this restaurant with my best friend last week. This place is absolutely amazing and satisfying. You walk into the dining room and it is another world. Â Time flows slowly and leisurely. Â The glass of Bordeaux blanc recommended by the staff set the wonderful tone. Â The bread was perfect. Â I had Porcini Flan to start with. Â The crab was so tender and the dashi broth went perfectly with the crab. Â I could not have enough of it. Â For entree I had the duck. Â It was the most tender and soft duck I ever had. Â The source was refined and I loved the hint of yuzu flavor. Â After the entree was complimentary ricotta cheese sorbet in melon juice. Â The combination of the cold and mild ricotta cheese and the room temperature melon juice was absolutely heavenly. Â Everything about the meal was simply perfect. It was definitely one of the best dining experience.,-1
I've finally made it to THE SHOP! And it was everything I could have asked for! I had the pork meatball mash with the spicy pork sauce. Delicious! It is very crowded (even at 10:30pm when i was there) so either get take out and prepare to wait!,-1
"I give this restaurant credit for bringing New Orleans-style food to Astoria and the decor was fun, too, but the portions were very small and way overpriced. I paid $15 for literally two-and-a-half cups of jambalaya. They skimped on the meat, too. In the end, my partner and I left feeling we were ""had"" and will not be going back.",-1
"if you don't mind waiting an hour for a table, Taverna Kyclades is the place to go for great seafood. I recommend the swordfish with lemon potatoes. Very good!",-1
"The food is terrific, the service is exceptional, and the place is very classy, even at the bar. I have dined here fairly often and have never gotten a poor meal or shoddy service. This is a wonderful spot for special occasions. I love to take out of towners here for their first experience of the coty. You cannot go wrong with this place but please call for reservations. a secret is thqt you can sit at the bar if you have no reservations and eat.",-1
"Wish I could give this a three and a half. Â The fries are bangin'. Â I suggest the mango chutney and the pesto. Â The crowds are fratty. Â Don't go there on any day that starts with an S, or an F, or any day which anyone might choose to take off of work for a celebratory reason. Â  Just sayin. The crowd during halloween went around the block. Â Yikes.",-1
"I really love this place! The food is fantastic--we had the cucumber/watermelon soup, frisee salad, oysters, scallops, fresh ricotta and rosewater pavolva. Since we ordered all small plates, our server suggested splitting the items into four courses. The drink menu is also inventive and delicious. I noticed that some other reviewers complained about the service and prices, but I found them both to be a pleasant surprise.",-1
"I've been to this Thai spot numerous times and have always been satisfied. Food is great, atmosphere/decor is great, service is great.",-1

great review,-1
"last trip to NY, took some rookies with me... Â what was one of the things they wanted to do? Â instead of club / bar / lounge hopping, they wanted to do pizza hopping... Â officially, I'm pizza'ed out until at least, 2011, I'm not even kidding with you... Â  knowing full well how ridiculous the lines were going to be at grimaldi's, on the way over, I called and placed a to-go order... Â yes, i'm that incredibly intelligent, or I'm that incredibly obsessed with food i know how to plan ahead... Â once we arrived, sure enough, even though it had started to rain, there was an insane line outside... Â secretly, deep down inside, grimaldi's has never been my favorite pizza spot, but i didn't want to ruin it for the others who have never tried it... Â don't get me wrong, their pies are amazing, easily in my top 3 favorite, not just in NY but the continental united states of America... Â (okay fine, and Canada as well) Â  ingredients still fresh, dough cooked to perfection, I can see how it would be peoples #1 favorite pizza in NY, it's just not mine... Â there's just something missing, can't quite put my finger on it, it's just a smidge off of my personal favorite... Â again, please, don't get me wrong, I inhaled the slices like the world was coming to an end, their pizza is amazing, and you owe it to yourselves to give it a shot, it's just not my favorite pizza is all I'm saying... Â  so while we were outside devouring the pizza, every single person in the group all agreed that it was the second best pizza they had in NY, and not one of them could articulate exactly what made the other place slightly better, albeit, not by very much... Â  this review isn't quite fair to grimaldi's though, because i do want people to try their pizza because as they say, different stroke for different folks... Â maybe this will be your favorite pie...",-1

"I've been to Market Table several times and I return for two reasons: first, the restaurant is situated on a corner with floor-to-ceiling windows and it offers a great setting for a meal in w village; second, the food is consistently delicious. This is a great date spot, and I'll likely return again in the future.",-1
"A Serbian band (accordians, guitars) plays every Tuesday and Friday. Â It's as awesome as it sounds. Â Beers are only $6.",-1
"Best beef pancakes in town. Long lines, horrible customer service. It's cheap eats, what do you expect.",-1
"If you haven't been to Clinton street bakery yet, youve missed out on some phenomenal pancakes. But beware!! You will be waiting at least an hour and a half, depending on the day and time you decide to swing by the restaurant. If you can, check into the restaurant so you can get your name on the waiting list, go do whatever else you need to do, and then return back. If you time it just right, you won't need to wait too long to be seated. Ok, onto the food itself! If you read the other reviewers, all you read about are the pancakes and it is no joke! It is definitely worth it! My review is more about the eggs Benedict. The dish was elegantly Prepared, even after we told them to rush the order because of a time constraint I had on my part. They still took the time to make it look just right, so it earned some points with me. The hollandaise sauce was a little salty to my taste but the biscuit and ham cancelled that out real quick. It was a nice balance of sweet and salty. Overall, no complaints from my end. As for my girlfriend, she had the plain pancakes with the maple butter and she still gives it five stars each time she has it! Food wise, it is five stars all the way, but the only complaint would be the wait time. I signed up on the list and waited almost two hours before I got seated. I had to keep checking up on the guy with the list to make sure we didn't get bumped down accidentally. Each time I asked, the wait time got extended another 20 minutes. So once you sign up on the list, let them know you will be waiting outside. :-)",-1
good,-1
I think the food is a little overrated,-1
"Great noodle soups. Not exactly a Raman noodle, as Sobaya uses authentic buckwheat noodles. Now the price is in the 15 dolar range, not bad seeing as they have large soups w plenty of vegies/toppings. Problem is most people rank it as cheap. This is one grade above in food, service, ambience, and price. There are other more affordable noodle themed shops nearby. Staff was friendly and enthusiastic about educating me on Asian cusine. Not a bad affordable date spot",-1
"Excellent spicy Boiled Dumplings and Fried Sesame Pancake with Ham and Egg, Duck or a lot of other varieties Descent Hot and Sour Soup as well a Corn and Egg Soup. Average Fried Dumplings though their dumplings is more expensive than the competition but at least if taste hygenic. They also have Prunella juice-thats great considering how hard it is to find it nowadays. If you want to get a seat, good luck since a lot of the patrons, and four of them at a time take their time (an hour) eating 5 pieces of dumplings. So it is not a place to eat inside unless you are so fortunate for find a seat. *To the owners, please implement a 30 minute seating while consuming food policy and no seating for people who have not ordered or simply leave their items on the chair. For every current patron who are ordering $1 and sitting for an hour, you are losing customers who would have ordered at least $10 worth at a time while only taking at most 30 minutes.",-1
Been here several times in the Â past and decide to Â drop by Â last night. Place is cool to hang out for several drinks. No dancing here so if your looking to go dancing this is not the spot. Crowded on the weekend totally dislike because I like plenty of room space. Lols...,-1
"One of my ""go-to"" places for brunch, a good neighborhood brunch spot that consistently delivers on delicious, filling brunch food from a tiny kitchen. Â I tend to go with the eggs benedict or florentine, which come with some refreshing salad and crispy potatos. Â The prix-fix can't be beat--$15 for an entree, espresso drink, and alcoholic beverage. Â The bloody mary is solid if not spectacular, but they have south american versions of mimosas which are worth trying. Â If you're not in the mood for drinks, everything is still very reasonably priced in the $9-10 range. I'm getting somewhat tired of brunch, but Beco is one of those places that makes me happy to just come back and order the exact same thing every time. Â I bet that the dinner options are delicious as well, but have not tried them yet.",-1
"This is my go-to restaurant whenever my parents or my girlfriend's parents are in town. Why? 1) Because the neighborhood is awesome 2) Because Good Fork's food is always consistent. My favorite there is the Kimchi Steak and eggs. Because I am a loser vegetarian, I usually get tofu instead of the Steak (it also drops the price of the plate to $14--score!). My parents, who are carnivores, will usually spring for the fish or chicken entrees. Both of which, from what I hear, are phenomenal. If you're there, and they have roasted brussel sprout, for the love of god, GET THEM. They will make you want to slap yo mamma.",-1
"One of my favorite places in Murray Hill - very hidden gem. We went there because we saw the ""Oyster happy hour"" sign - Delicious 99 cent Blue Point Oysters on the half shell served with lemon and 2 sauces - one tomato, the other vinegar (both delicious). Then we had Tuna Tatar which was also very yummy and as a main course 2 daily specials. I highly recommend the Tuna Burger - if available or the pasta with Lobster. It seems to be busy most of the time but if it is worth the wait. Also the waiters are very relaxed and nice!",-1
I like this French place in Chelsea. Â It is not cheap by any means but it offers good food and has an outdoor seating area that is a nice touch during the warmer months. The mussel dishes are very good and come with a great broth. Â I also like the house salad which had high-quality ingredients. Â  The wine selection is also very good. Â The staff is friendly and knowledgable.,-1
"A classic late-night staple. Food's okay but standing outside in line with your tipsy/drunk friends salivating at the glistening meat amidst the cacocphony of squeals, moans and pounding knives, pouring copious amounts of hot sauce and gasping for air while your taste buds sizzle in delight?...priceless",-1
"I'd been meaning to check out Good Fork since I love visitor Red Hook so much. I got a chance a while back and am disappointed to say that I didn't get to eat any of the food. Why am I reviewing it then? Because I appreciated the busy staff member who we inconvenienced. She tried to seat us outside, but we couldn't bear the heat and humidity. They were too busy to seat us inside, but were gracious when we left after being seated. The staff member (brunette curly hair, red lipstick, glasses) was kind enough to recommend a few restaurants we might try instead and assured us that our annoying behavior was no trouble at all. I will be back now that the weather is nicer, and will be sure to recommend Â this restaurant to others, based on the friendly and accommodating service we experienced.",-1
best pizza in NY,-1
"This place is OK. Tried their deviled egg which was good but nothing compared to the one @ Blind Tiger. Tried the ""Liquid Gold"", local beer which was good.",-1
"The ramen at Barn Joo is the packaged kind that you can buy at Hmart for $1. Â They charge $13. Â Why do you put this on the menu when most people can cook packaged ramen fairly well on our own? Otherwise, the food is uninspired. Â Not great. Â Not horrible. Â Passable. Â The decor is just weird. Â Ropes everywhere that makes it look like you're in the wild west where Korean food is served. Probably won't go back.",-1
"This restaurant is immaculate, I think it served the best food in the city. It is absolutely amazing. The service was on point. The server can explain what you ordered to make it sound so delicious. They even recommend courses that we may not have known. I love the atmosphere in there, such a cozy, and comfortable place. ABC Kitchen is a must visit for tourists, so they can talk about it all the way back to their native. The price is high since it is a specialty restaurant. But it is still worth it. The food, the service, and the atmosphere confirmed my admiration for this restaurant.",-1
"relatively cheap, ok size portion take-out. good thing is you can sit down in the bustling area.",-1
Delicious dumplings that are cheap. My Metro swipe costs more than those dumplings,-1
"Great, safe place for Celiacs to enjoy delicious Italian food. Choose from pastas, soccas (chickpea pancakes, like pizzas), salads, meats, and delicious desserts! Very cozy ambiance; feels like ""fancy at a reasonable price."" Good wine list and full bar available. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful staff. Makes for a great pre-theatre dinner or take-out. Must try the soccas and the gnocchi!",-1

"My wife & I took my kids & a friend here Friday night around 8. The dining area was full. The waitress came over to us right away, moved a table or two to accommodate us & we were seated. We had a Table 87 salad which was excellent. Then Â some baked clams & fried calamari which by far was the best we ever had. So tender. We had a large Margherita & a breakfast pie. Out of this world! Then on the waitresses recommendation we had a Nutella pie. Thumbs up for her recommendation! Great food & service. This is definitely our new spot! We will be back very soon.",-1
great Greek food. Thanks to all my fellow yelpers for recommending this place. Â I had the lamb chops and they were excellent.,-1

"Tink's is a small cozy restaurant with cute decor. All of the food sounds fantastic, but it didn't quite live up to expectations. I wasn't completely disappointed, but I just didn't think anything was terrific. I especially did not like the burrata.",-1
The place is really small but the Jerk chicken is absolutely delicious. Â The Jamaican style food is very good. Â There's a quiet area upstairs and it's very peaceful. Â I love this place very much.,-1
If you are a Western NYer and you need your anchor bar or duffs fix then this is the place. Â They proudly display a bills helmet over the top of the cooler and you can get Labatt blue and Genny Screamers. Â Only problem is they always run out of cold Labatts too quickly. Â Only thing I have ever had to eat here has been the wings. Â They are authentic Buffalo wings. Â Big wings served with blue cheese and carrots and celery. Â  GO BILLS,-1
"I went here on a Sunday night with friends, and it was about a 45 minute wait. Â It was packed...so that goes to show how good it is. Â But we only waited for maybe 15 minutes or so. Â I had the pork buns - I really recommend that. Â And the sampler appetizer dish (I forgot what it was called), was really good. I tried the ramen and it was ok...but I'm not a huge fan of ramen to begin with. Â They have a thing where if you have enough soup remaining in your bowl, you can order a second round of ramen and you pay $2. Â So that's good for people who don't get full easily. I loved the atmosphere, the decor was really nice as well. I would definitely go again.",-1
"4.5 Stars Got here at 8:15 on Sunday morning and we already had to wait 45 minutes to be seated.

When we were seated I noticed that the tables were VERY close together and it was very crowded. Â The service was pretty fast and the waitress was very nice. We looked over the menu while drinking some really delicious coffee. What we ordered: Eggs Benedict ($18) I got it with the smoked salmon Country Breakfast ($13) Brioche French Toast ($14) the carmelized Bananas were a nice touch Blueberry Pancakes ($14) amazing Cheese Grits ($5) very good We also bought some Chive and Goat Cheese Scones to go. Â They were delicious. Â I will definitely be back.",-1
"Dunno if its the best burger considering it is $26. But it is a damn good burger. Glad I tried it, but dunno if I'd continuously shell out that kinda money for a burger. Very juicy and cooked to a good medium rare. The frites were not bad.",-1

Best Pizza Ever! Love every bite! Yum!,-1
"Nice bar, has outdoor space. Â Just another normal bar.",-1
"This is my favorite NYC restaurant. The fish tacos remind me of home. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. This is my last visit for a while. Going back home so I had a delicious ""burger with the lot"". It was perfectly cooked. My friend had oysters and beer and boy were they good. Can't wait to come back to NYC to get some meat pies. The chef said they're a special but she's planning to make it them regular menu item. They were yummy. See you Koala!",-1
I don't get the poor reviews. 4 superb pork and chive dumplings for one measly dollar bill. A friggin steal.,-1
"I always believed that pasta was one of these dishes that were hard to mess up: you can make ok pasta, good pasta, or excellent pasta, but you couldn't really make _bad_ pasta. Well, I'm happy to say that I was wrong. Osteria Morini clearly established that with enough will power, you can make bad pasta. Soaked in oil and salt to the point where you wonder if that's just the dipping sauce for the stale bread, my noodles really didn't deserve their fate. One of the worst restaurants in New York (don't worry though, there's still a line of hungry fashionistas waiting for a table).",-1
decent and authentic,-1
"I would call this a ""middle of the road"" tapas place. Nothing too extraordinary about the ambiance, except if the day is nice you can sit outside on seventh street, which is pretty cool. Â The food, which looks like it will be great when ordering off the menu, is always disappointing upon entering your mouth. Â Mojitos are OK, as is the sangria, but nothing at all to write home about. Â This place is OK, but not all that good. I haven't had brunch here, and I know its popular for that.",-1
"The food was healthy, excellent (try the halo-halo supreme) and varied --and all 6 of us were pleased with our meals. This is a very small and popular place. The food was delicious, the portions were good and the prices were even better. I had the Shrimp Scampi which was so good that I wanted to bottle up the sauce left and take it home. This is not an Italian Restaurant but the Scampi was better, yes I said better than any other that I have ever had.",-1
"Best. Lobster. Ever. The oysters were great (as far as i can remember) and there was an appearance made by apples at dessert that was pretty tasty. yeah, i got a little drunk. the wine was good too. The service was nice, the bathrooms are great--it's important-- BUT... minus one star because they messed up my friend's fried chicken TWICE. overcooked the first time and undercooked the second (and we aren't picky bitches, we only send back if it's the real deal not good). so i guess i would say, get the lobster and everything else (the whole fish dish was excellent also), and stay away from the fried chicken. I will totally be back for the lobster, and if you're a big eater, you should order 2 to be on the safe side!",-1
"This place makes the best risotto in New York. Despite the cramped quarters, Risotteria is the quintessential Greenwich Village experience.",-1
"Best ramen in NYC, I tried all the ones they have on the menu, the best is the modern! Try to get there early, the wait can be VERY long.",-1
"I was in this past tuesday. Great atmosphere, Excellent bartender, loved the pizza and the salad. I will be back again and again",-1
"Overall this place is average and expensive! While everyone raves about their stuff, I found that the 'best' on their menu wasn't made by them, such as the cheese and meat plates. However, the outdoor garden is adorable.....except when it poured on my husband and i because they didn't close the overhang.",-1
"This place has great date night ambiance (although there were groups of friends out too) and great music. We came with our two year old. They don't have kids chairs but were friendly. The appetizers were our favorites-the octopus dish was outstanding; empanadas were good (though not as good as empanadas cafe in Corona); blood sausage was great. My chicken entree was fair, but who orders chicken at restaurants? The steak with chimichurri, ravioli and steak sandwich were all good. Would definitely return. Plus I believe they have a woman chef !",-1
Great for brunch. Â As so many have said before - great french toast.,-1
"waaat, ostrich and kangaroos for entres? maybe an anise in that cocktail you are sipping? Public is more like a universal republic with all sort of wild dishes. their tasting menu is VERY stuffing but will satisfy all your wild dreams about food",-1
"If you are really hungry, it is a fine choice. But I would save the calories. I didn't like any of the hot sauces either.",-1
"I liked the food here. Â While it wasn't anythign that blew my mind, I still liked the food and drinks here. For starters: Grilled kangaroo on a coriander falafel with lemon tahini sauce and green pepper relish - Â it wasn't gamey and tasted like steak so def. try it. Fried Hama Hama oysters with shiso, sansho pepper, and wasabi-yuzu dipping sauce - i liked this one the best. Â the sauce paired with the fried oysters perfectly. entrees: Pan-seared Tasmanian sea trout on a salad of fennel, green apple and pistachio with preserved lemon yogurt and fennel pollen - trout was moist and crispy and had great flavor. Polenta and aleppo crusted cod with a smoked corn and barley risotto, and truffle-huitlacoche vinaigrette - cod was good. not crazy about the risotto. Dessert: Sticky toffee pudding with Armagnac ice cream and hot caramel sauce - wayyyyy tooooo sweet. did not like at all. Kiwi Crush 42 Below vodka, muddled kiwi fruit, lime juice, and a soda top - good drink.",-1
Great breakfast spot in the East Village. Â Kale salad with eggs was a tasty & healthy option. Â Limited seating so make sure you get here early. Â Definitely worth the wait.,-1
"Holy Crepe --I am dying from happiness after meeting my new sweet and savory friends near Wall Street. I wandered in there accidentally without crepe expectations. Â  Thoughts of the great philospher Ricky Bobby from Talledega Nights fame danced in my mind as I perused the menu: Ricky Bobby: 'Oh, I love the crepe suzette.' Jean Girard: 'With the sugar and lemon juice...' Ricky Bobby: 'Yeah, the sugar and the lemon juice. Sure.' Jean Girard: 'Grand Marnier.' Ricky Bobby: 'I wish I could crawl into one of those right now. I'd eat my way out from the inside.' Well said my inbred Faulkneresque guru...who doesnt love crepes--they contain my holy trinity of proper nutrition: 1. Â cheese 2. Â a salty meat 3. Â a liquor based creamy sauce. CrÃªpe ComplÃ¨te Sunny-Side-Up Egg, Ham, Jarlsberg 9 See what I did there-I cut and pasted from their menu---I am going to do it one more time: Braised Beef Short Ribs Jus Naturel, Seared Tomatoes, Cheese 12 I dont even have to insert a witty expression here--because BAM CrÃªpes Du Nord Smoked Salmon, Scrambled Egg, Dill CrÃ¨me 10 Stop groaning at me-or else I wont be able to tell you about their 2 for 1 happy hour from 4-7....and their non-crepe bistro offerings like Blue Shell Mussels Shallots, shaved garlic, tarragon, white wine cream broth 12 Lacking any semblance of creativity, wit or a soul (at least that's what I think my therapist said?)--let me tell you about their savory side: Nutella & Banana Chocolate Sauce, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream 7 Am I nut (ella) ella ella? Â  Have I lost it? Â Am I thinking of applying for a job there for the free food? Â  Do I have cravings: Midnight Sun White Chocolate, Fresh Raspberries, Whipped Cream 8 Is it considered stalking if I have my mail delivered there? Is this actually a review or a love letter? Am I going to cut and paste something else? Stay tuned-readers-you know where to find me--17 South William Street.",-1
"I love this place- the space is adorable; small yet feels spacious. Â The two tables by the front wall are cozier than the three on the other side as there are lanterns under the table and the chairs are more comfortable (and colorful). Food is made with great care, using fresh ingredients and interesting combinations. Slow down; enjoy the atmosphere which feels a little like an indoor garden scene from a Murakami novel. However, I get the feeling that once they officially open; their menu is going to expand. Armed with the owner's cell phone, I'll be back!",-1
"I've visited a few times over the last month and unfortunately it wasn't the same experience as my first dinner here. The most recent meal was by far the worst and my last try with this place. I had a friend in town so I took her here for dinner. It didn't start out well when the server explained they were out of at least 4 or 5 items on the menu...and it's a small menu. So we ordered a few things to share. The calamari was horrid...chewy and poorly done. Both our pasta entrees were under seasoned, over cooked and flavorless. If you are going to charge $16 for a simple tomato pasta, it better be perfect and this wasn't even close. Â A big disappointment, since I really want to love this place! The ambiance is perfect and the place is stunning, the staff is friendly but I'm sorry I will be spending my money elsewhere from now on.",-1
"Who would have thought I'd find a nice izakaya in the theater district? Well, it's here. However, if you want a seat, don't come too late. I showed up at 6:30 once and got the last seat in the place (at the bar) because I was by myself. The bartender was great though, and I loved the various yakitori goodies I got, especially the chicken gizzards. The ginkos were very nice, as was the mushroom. The potatoes were the least tasty, but still nice. On another occasion, my mother had a very rich ramen full of seafood and other tasty tidbits, while I enjoyed a luscious piece of grilled miso salmon and codfish pickled in sake lees. The servers are pleasant and fast, so it's a great pre-theater stop.",-1
"I was skeptical when they opened (and before all the great reviews of the joint started coming out), but I have been a die-hard advocate for this place since my first bite of their Italian meatloaf panini, shortly after they opened. This place is the real deal -- inspired combinations of fillings on perfect panini bread. Add to that excellent salads, a well-curated selection of wines, and best-in-breed coffee-house desserts. And keep your eyes out for the special sandwhiches of the day -- don't pass on any with fresh chicken livers or their tuna. My 1 detraction would be to pass on the meat/cheese plates. the quality is there but the portions seemed small. You're better off splitting the carpaccio salad or losing yourself in the decadently rich tuna-stuffed-tomato before your panini or, better, your crostini. bon appetite.",-1
"This place Â is known for that sort of instant hipster-generator effect. I love the atmosphere of Cafe Habana. And then, the food! Cuban sandwich and the corn will satisfy you very well!!! One thing I always find uncomfortable about this place is the space! The limited space only allow us to have a couple inches between tables.",-1
Pizza is almost unbeatable but only 3 stars because they are so rude! Speedy service but they rush you in and out,-1
the fried chicken sandwich hits the spot on morning afters. but when is the snotty service brooklyn trend going to end! im sorry i switched my side from beans to collard greens!!!!!!!!!,-1
"The service here was top-notch, but I did not enjoy most of what I ordered. My boyfriend is a vegetarian so Mediterranean is usually a safe bet. There were several apps and small plates for him but only one entrÃ©e option: Mushroom Gnocchi. The gnocchi was about triple the size of any gnocchi I've ever seen, and the texture was not as fluffy as I've come to expect from gnocchi. He said the mushrooms were very well-seasoned though. The best thing I ate was the spicy feta dip. It was creamy and delicious. The falafel buns were interesting. I don't tend to love steamed buns but the falafel mixture was on-point so I guess it depends on your personal tastes. The worst thing I ate was the eggplant caviar. It tasted like a chimney sweep's broom, in other words... way too smoky. My steak was flavorful and had a nice crust, but I asked for medium-rare and it was definitely RARE when first brought to me. It also came with a ""mushroom sauce"", but I could only find 1 mushroom. My zatar fries had a ton of great flavor but were pretty soggy when they arrived. I don't need to go back here.",-1
"Les Chicken Wings has the appetizing description ""reconstructed panko crusted chicken wings"" for $14. I handed the owner $20 for an order to go, and was given back four singles (that is the new thing in bar eateries, they keep whatever quarters and dimes you're owed. stealing. not on the level of bernie madoff, but still theft). What I got was four chicken lolipops in decent sauce. Meh. Tiny portion. At least I got some slices of nice bread included, which saves this from a one star review.",-1
Oh Marlow and Sons. Â I love you so much. Â  I've probably been here over 20 times throughout the years. Â Sometimes Marlow is good. Â Most of the times it is great. Â Once in a while you'll have a meal that is absolutely magical.,-1
"Very usable web site; changes daily and includes specials. Have only been here for late lunch on a slow day, but was very impressed and plan to return. Waiter was unobtrusively attentive; burger was very tasty and chicken was high quality; prices were reasonable, and interior was new, comfortable, very clean and left us wanting to come check this place out on a busy night!",-1
"The $5 slice is absurd to begin with. There are some pretty tremendous $2-$2.50 slices out there. But the bigger issue is that the owners of this place must be ""well-connected"". This is now the 3rd time since 2007 they've been shut down for being a health hazard, and our local media beams over it's reopening, going even to the lengths of putting down inspecters. All while the owner jokes about the fly & mouse-laden conditions and remarks that the shut downs are great cause it's nice to get a vacation every now and then. Blatant disrespect for customers and potential customers. Also, in a time where the economy is so rough, they could really hire some staff, for cleanliness and to speed things up, considering the outrages prices. So i have to give them the full thumbs down.",-1
"I love this place food is always consistent and staff is super friendly, I go to the original Turko, it is more consistent!!",-1
"Been here a few times. It's pretty good but I think kind of overrated. Sometimes you'll have to wait, you might feel a bit rushed, you might get splinters on the unfinished wood, and the arepas are solid, but not mindblowing. Could kinda go for a chorizo arepa now though. I shouldn't review when I'm hungry and it's too late to eat. Bad idear.",-1
"If you love France, you will love this restaurant. The food is very good, typical of a small cafe on the banks of the Seine. The tables sit right next to each other, so you can peruse your neighbor's food and comment. The waitress has excellent English with a lovely French accent. I think they have raised the food prices to compensate for the lack of liquor revenue, so it cost us $120 for a three course dinner for 2. It is small, crowded, noisy, and wonderful.",-1
grea food,-1
This is my go to place in the neighborhood. Â  Always amazing and always packed!,-1
"Delicious! Spicy meatballs are actually spicy and cooked perfectly. Ive been here more than I can count on one hand and I will continue to return to this simple , delicious establishment! Good stuff TMS!!",-1
"The place is super cute. It was nice to just come here and relax with friends. The chef's dessert and tea was a good deal at $17. You get your choice of drink and a (rotating) 3-course dessert: raspberry mousse cake, black sesame creme brulee, ice cream with berries, and a macaroon and truffle. I wouldn't recommend the cold matcha green tea ($7)- it tastes pretty standard. Go for something you've never had before because they have an interesting and extensive selection of tea.",-1
"Yes yes yes! Â $2.50 for excellant falafel that's fast and yummy. Â Better than the other place right across the street (bigger, fuller sandwiches). Â I got the hot sause, and that sause is not joking around - it's HOT! Â Slightly too hot for me, but if you like spicy, go for it. Â  I'll take mine without next time! Â Definitely be back!",-1
I am a fan because this place is so classic NY divey. Â Surly staff and all. Â Drunk as skunk occasional patrons. Â That guy at the bar that just won't shut up. Â But you tolerate and nod along just because that is what you are supposed to do. This is a fun place to escape back to the 60's drunken bar scene. Â It used to just ooze that classic stale smoke smell as well.. but unfortunately that stench is waning. Not a place for a date. Â But definitely a place to grab a few after a shite day on the street.,-1
YUMMY! I can't wait to go back!,-1
"have been wanting to try this place out for a while. it was awesome! we decided to each get coffee and a donut to start our brunch off donuts were so tasty but beware, they will fill you up.. if you too want to start with them, think about sharing one so you won't fill up before your meal comes. Â  (or get some to-go to enjoy later in the day.) chicken and waffles, hippie banjo.. soo good. can't wait to go back and try more!",-1
I loved the meal but then I saw this horrible woman named Ali-son S. Werdlof. Â Across the room. Â Ruined the entire meal for me.,-1
My husband and I went there for lunch and found the restaurant to be a perfect choice for traditional malay and singaporean food. I ordered the Roti Canai which is a naan/chapati/crepe served with traditional chicken curry. The curry sauce was just like I remembered it and very different from what Americans would call curry (the spices/flavor is more sourced from the south-indian style which is darker and stronger in flavor). The best way to eat this dish: your hands...tear apart the roti and dunk it until your fingers are drenched in the curry and then drop it off in your mouth. True hand-style enthusiasts can do this with one hand! Great place to meet up with friends. It's also right beside Ferrara's if you want Italian desserts.,-1
"My Negroni was a perfect three part and many props to the bar manager for stocking carpano antica sweet vermouth. Also, the bar staff was super nice. The menu is stacked with really nice options. Â I had the Garganelli with rabbit. Â It was weirdly citrus-y but, really excellent. Â Garganelli is always my favorite, wish more places had that kind of pasta. The plate next to mine I might have liked even better, it was a corn ravioli. Â Sweet and savory! Â  The charcuterie seemed to be freshly sliced and very tasty. One problem: Â The table was too small. My wine glass almost spilled on me a few times as my company was reaching for bread... or maybe we just ordered too much food. haha this place is the bee's knees",-1
Dumplings are mmm delish!,-1
"I felt that the place was pretty small and cramped. The food was okay, nothing to be too excited about. The waiters and managers were all very nice and accomodating. My date seemed to like the place more than me. The drinks were very good. Especially the mojitos. The dessert was better than the dinner. I felt that dinner offered small portions. The dessert was very tasty.",-1
"Taking off one star because of reservation silliness (table for two at 5 or 11?) Anyway, finally made it here for lunch. Â I agree with lots of the reviews that say the Black Label burger was good, but definitely nowhere near what it should be based on all of the hype. Â But everything we else really was delicious. Â I especially enjoyed the HuÃ®tres et CrÃ©pinettes (sausage and oysters).",-1
"Great margarita pizza!!!!! , friendly nice, cool people, and the cheeses MWUAHHH yummmmuy",-1
This place might be my all around favorite restaurant in the area. The menu is creative and thoughtful and everything from the appetizers to the desserts are always well prepared and presented. The service is top notch and I think there is something for everyone at this place. I'm someone who hates brunch crowds but I'll make the mile walk from my apartment to eat here because everything is so delicious. The prices are reasonable and I'm always surprised by that because it has such lovely decor and excellent dishes.,-1
"Ricotta gnocchi with cream truffle sauce - yes please! All the food was great, and I really enjoyed the ambiance. Would recommend to anyone. I'll be back.",-1
"This is purely a review for their lunch. I came here for a business lunch. My business partner had made an reservation, which apparently seemed lost with the hostess. We had really looked forward to sitting at a real table but decided to settle for the bar. I had the seabass, which was very good. Perfectly cooked and crispy. I had a huge problem with the portion, though. For the price, it was TINY. Like literally two 3-inch pieces overlaying some greens. I guess it was nice to force me on a diet but I left super hungry and just ended up pigging out for the next meal. I will cut them slack for high quality ingredients, though.",-1
"First, there's not too many Filipino restaurants in the greater NY area except those in Queens or NJ. Maharlika is an attempt at a classy or gourmet Filipino restaurant in Manhattan. It was better than I expected, but the overall taste delivery falls a bit short of true Philippine cooking. It does a better job at presentation than taste. The 'sisig' special was disappointing. The classics -- adobo & kare-kare - were the better choices. I wouldn't frequent the pace, but sure I would go back again with friends who would like to try it.",-1
Perfect in every way. Easy to find in TriBeCa. Very cool design and decor. Fine dining with ZERO pretension. Seated earlier than reserved time. Friendliest bartender ever. Very professional and experienced server who knew the menu items front to back. Food was better than good. Chili Lobster and Chicken Under a Brick are both highly recommended.,-1
this place is overrated the food was just ok we waited like 1 hour to be seated the price is definitely attractive but not worth the long wait and ok food ...,-1
"Great pizza place for lunch, always packed, good well drinks. Pie is served in rectangular slices. Sausage may be a bit on the salty side. We ordered a couple pitchers of beer, a 10"" quattro formaggi pizza, and a larger square pizza with a ton of veggie toppings. Â We were in a larger party, and some of the group also ordered meatballs and pasta, which were unremarkable. Â However, we came for pizza and were not disappointed! Â The 10"" pie was fairly typical form a crust and consistency perspective. Â However, the cheese combination was outstanding! I wish that I could have had more than one piece, but the entire pie was consumed in about 10 seconds. The old fashioned pizza was delicious! I like that the crust was soft but had a nice crunch. We got mushroom and prosciutto toppings and it was a nice combo. I will definitely be back here!",-1
Great place for a quick bite. I have been here twice. I get the plate with brown rice chicken and salad. Really good. Although please don't joke about the Ottoman empire. The meat handler doesn't appreciate that.,-1
"I went in Â there couple of months ago with my hubby, it must have been the first couple of weeks they opened. So there was no wait (luckily!). Try getting a reservation now, it is sometimes weeks away. We were wandering inside ABC (as I usually do when I pass by) and realized that there is a brand new restaurant downstairs. We decided to give it a shot since we have nothing planned that night. The decor and the ambience was chic but very comfortable. It felt like we went into someone's summer house almost. I ordered beets with yoghurt and the fried organic chicken and my hubby went for the halibut. I couldn't believe how a simple dish like beets and yoghurt could taste so sophisticated and my chicken was tender and delicious. Hubby definitely like the halibut. All we did was to talk about the place, utensils, plates and what an extraordinary job they did for the place. Another important point for was their ingredients were organic and local. It has been a real delight! I tried going back with my girlfriends but we could only get to sit at the bar. Hey, word spreads really fast in NYC. I think it is a great addition to a great store like ABC and I will definitely be back.",-1
"The food is delicious. This place is the perfect place for an afternoon brunch. The decor is homey and very comforting. The ambience is great; festive and loud, perfect for our noisy Mediterranean family. The service is impeccable. The after-meal chocolates are the perfect after-meal treats. Food is inventive and the menu choices are plentiful. All in all - a brunch delight.",-1
"There's an old saying, a smart person learns from their mistakes. A wise person learns from the mistakes of others. With that being said, BE CAREFUL WITH THE HOT SAUCE! I took the sage advice of street food aficionado Clint H who warned about the importance of not putting what you may normally consider to be a reasonable amount of hot sauce on your food. This hot sauce is one of those nuclear powered hot sauces where the taste lingers forever. A small dollop is plenty. Anyway, this is easily the best street food I've had in NY. And that's saying a lot considering how much crap I've eaten off the streets of NY over the past 2 decades. Don't automatically just go for the platter either because the sandwiches are monstrous and delicious as well. It gets a little messy but it's fine cuz the pigeons will love you for it. Take some extra napkins and be ready to hit the gym for your street sins. Totally worth running 5, err 10 miles for though.",-1
Great ambience. Wasn't so impressed with the food. We orderrd Hamachi crude for appetizers which was too salty. Â I got the hake for my main entry which was on the bland side.. we ordered a bottle of wine. Â Had to remind the waiter about or empty glass. Â Very cute decor but not a place I would rave or recommend over the many better places in ny,-1
"OMG, I Give 5 stars to everything. The tapas are amazing. The lamb meatballs with potatoes, the bread with tomatoes sauce and the sangria, the cozy ambiance. I know you will love this place.",-1
"So delicious. Everything here was uh-mazing. I'd say order everything but that's unrealistic. Â  Love the ambiance, pretty cozy with soft lighting and the requisite candles. The seating may be a bit claustrophobic for some (my girlfriend included) but you're not in danger of constantly bumping elbows. Now for the important stuff: the food. The ceviche was mediocre; I feel like I've had better elsewhere. Everything else was great. Based on the fantastic food and service we enjoyed here, we will definitely be back.",-1
Usually so good. Major fail today. Waited 30 minutes. They lost my sabich. Consolation prize was cabbage salad. No thanks!,-1
"The prices are great, and the sesame see bread sandwiches are great. Still, the bathroom is nasty, the lines are long and there is no place to sit. It is a little dirty in this place, and you are always bumping into people you don't know and don't want to know. Dumplings are pretty good, over all. Very good, and over-rated too.",-1
"Loved everything we ordered. Rabbit, tomato pasta, halibut, fried zucchini and eggplant. Pasta was cooked al dente and thats what made it perfect. The service was good and the place was busy. Dessert was nice too. I feel portions are a little small but other than that we had a fun. Will definitely return.",-1
"OVERRATED tourist trap! It tastes like plastic on cardboard. Sorry...I know it's the ""oldest pizza place"" in NYC, etc etc but that doesn't make it the best or even good. Regardless of this review, loads and loads of tourists will keep coming back for more and lining up to get less than mediocre ""pizza.""",-1
"In one word Amazing!!!!!. Starting from every small detail in the service down to the food and deserts eastwick has it all figured out. I went with a few friends last week and it was simply the best meal I had in a long time. Starting from our drinks, we has great red wine dwon to my main course the special lamb shank it was great. The meat was perfectly coocked tender & juicey not extra seasoned so the natural flavor of the lamb was very present. My desert was great warm appale pie that was not to sweet and havey like in some places. Service was great and manager came to talk to us and welcome us, seems like they know the regulars here. I will gladly come to eat at eastwick again the first chance I get great experiance",-1
"Very crowded and a scene on weekends where the beer flows freely for about $7 a glass from a variety of taps. They've got wurst and other German-esque treats too with a somewhat frustrating self-service food bar. You order first from a menu and then wait to pick up your food once it's prepared. That's not so bad if you're with someone but if you're solo at the bar, you hope no one grabs your seat while you're grabbing your grub. All in all, not a bad place to hang as long as you know the crowd is most twenty-somethings partying. Service is friendly enough but somewhat indifferent for this is a pay-as-you-go kind of joint.",-1
"Simple, delicious, inexpensive. What else do you expect from a food cart?",-1
"No other place to go but here for Sunday brunch. The food is always great, their bloody marry is the best in town. I love the crowd, the service and aways return because I know ill be getting top notch everything.",-1
"This was a delicious meal! From the tastiest miso- to the end, it was fantastic! I was treated for my birthday, so I can't be a judge on the pricing but, whatever it was, it IS worth it! I had the chirashi, not only excrutiatylingly fresh, but there was so much I couldn't finish. We got there for an early lunch with reservation, and by the time we left there was a line. So do heed the reservation warnings!",-1
terrible pizza was burned and waited forever go in naples and learn how to make the real thing because u false advertise i was so mad never again,-1
After stopping by several times I feel I have to suggest BR. Â Go there and get yourself some great donuts in the morning and then come back for a really really good burger with Mothers Milk.,-1
Delicious and decent price. Always crowded. Large food portion. Good for group.,-1
"Visited Vitae earlier this week after reading some good reviews, plus it was walking distance from our hotel. Booked through open table where I added a comment telling them that I had proposed earlier in the day. Arrived to be greeted with a congratulations and a glass of champagne which was nice. All the waiters congratulated us and were super friendly! Every dish we had was delicious and a pretty good price also! Wouldn't hesitate in visiting again!",-1
Great burgers! Be sure to ask for the cheese tots too....,-1
"Two dollars fifty for a super fresh falafel sandwich is a big winner in my book. I can't give the place five stars because nothing will ever live up to my glorified memories of Amsterdam Falafel's topping bar in DC, but this is pretty darn good for a classically topped falafel. Sandwich is a half pita filled with falafel balls, tahini sauce, lettuce, and tomato. You can add hot sauce from the giant squeeze bottle on the first of the two tables inside. The line moves faster than you could believe. Remember to grab a bunch of napkins on your way out the door. I tried the shwarma and wasn't a fan -- too greasy for me -- but I don't think I really like beef shawarma and so can't count that against Mamoun's.",-1
Good food!,-1
"Great place. Â The grits are great -- I had the shrimp 'n grits, finished with a delicious sauce. Â The Voodoo bloody mary (with crab meat), was also solid. Â The prices are great, and the space is low-key rustic. Â They could expand their menu a bit, but that's not much of a complaint.",-1
Ate here on a Friday evening. You can't book but they take you're number and name and call when a tables free. We got lucky as someone hadn't answered their phone and were seated straightaway at the bar. Good cocktail and beer first then we ordered the food coming fairly quickly. Standout dishes were the pulled pork bun and apple with kimchi.The food and atmosphere were great but the decor needs a refresh.,-1
"Grimaldi's is great!! They serve solid pizza and the location is really cool. It's great, unless you have to wait 2 hours like you sometimes do. In my opinion, it is not at all worth that kind of wait. But I've been on off hours and gotten a table immediately. In that case, the meal is satisfying and worth the trip. One note - it seems like they lost their liquor license! The booze is now scratched out on their menu but I know I've had drinks there in the past.",-1
"Pros: Corn. Pork chops with mushroom gravy. Fast service. Marjito (Margarita/Mojito). Goat Cheese bread. Black beans with hot sauce. Awesome cozy cuban atmosphere. Cons: Long wait to be seated. No where to wait. Food is inconsistent (been here a lot and sometimes the food is over cooked). OVERALL, I can't stop going back for more.........................",-1
"Already thinking about a return trip to NYC just to eat here again. Â  It was very packed but we found 3 seats at the bar no problem. Cafe Katja is serving better food than many of the meals I experienced while living there. Â everyone here was super friendly. Â The atmosphere is also warm and comfy. Pretzels, sausage sampler, the bacon wrapped sausage, liverwurst, meatballs, salmon---everything was DELiCIOUS! I definitely will be returning to the spot as it left me feeling at home. Awesome German & Austrian beers on tap.",-1
Good food in a corny setting. Â Is indeed extremely fresh and great quality fish. Â Octopus stands out as their best flavored item. Â Very tender and juicy. JUICY! Got some free wine while we waited for a table. Â And damn did we wait and wait and wait................................and wait!,-1
"Excellent meal. The food is delicious and authentic. We ordered both the pork and crab dumplings, both were exceptional- I preferred the the pork. We also ordered one seafood dish, a chicken dish and a noodle soup. Everything is served family style in decently large portions. We went as a party of 3 on a Sunday evening and there was no wait. While the food is exceptional, keep in mind that this is not the restaurant you go to if you are looking for a quiet relaxing sit down experience with family or friends. This place is loud, crowded (there are almost as many employees as customers) and unless you have a large party or wait to sit at one of the smaller tables, you will likely be sitting at a large table with other diners. Cash only and 15% gratuity is added to the check.",-1
"UGH, I hate to downgrade b/c I do love this place, but a couple of recent issues (I have now eaten there for dinner, brunch, and lunch (twice). Â  1) They leave all of the doors and windows open and there is an ABSURD fly problem. Â I mean, they are everywhere. Â My wife got her legs bittne up. Â I have no clue why they don't close the doors and turn on the AC and get the flies OUT. Â It is really gross. Â All over your food, in your face, etc. the whole meal. Â I will not go back this summer unless they fix this. Â  2) They charge $12 for a vodka lemonade. Â Obnoxious. This is the Upper West Side, not the West Village. Â Stop. Â  3) The catfish tacos are revolting. Â Sloppy, mushy bites of fish on soft tortillas that get soggy and gross so you can't pickup the taco and you have to consume it like catfood with forfulls of mush. Umm, guys, you do SO many things well, get this stuff in line!!! Â It is a great addition to the area, but gotta get your act together on a few fronts. Â The Fried Chicken Caesar remains delicious, as are the pickled stuff.",-1
"Mark was a phenomenal waiter. Kampachi appetizer with stamen Sichuan pepper flower was divine, lamb phenomenal. Wine pairing perfect. Hands down one of best meals I've ever had in the city!",-1
"Stopped by for the second time this summer. First time around me and two friends made the mistake of buying dessert here. Don't waste your money on the dessert menu! However, I remembered how tasty some of the dishes passing by looked and made a mental note to try their food menu. I stopped by yesterday with a few people from work, we were all satisfied and happy with our choices. Also they serve Breakfast till 4, which I think is pretty awesome. Also there are some vegan friendly choices and that's a good thing when you're hanging with a variety of people. Make sure you sit outside on a nice day, very comfortable and relaxed environment. Good food and a great place for chatting it up. I'll be back.",-1
"This place is totally awesome. The place is pretty small and feels like someone's kitchen. There's always random people sitting around, hanging out, watching tv and sipping cafe con leche. Sometimes they have their shoes off. Sometimes their grandkids are doing homework next to them.",-1
"Wonderful atmosphere (check out the Japanese bathrooms) and great for dinner. But definitely give their (completely different from dinner) lunch menu a pass. It's overpriced and doesn't have that great of options. There is the same or better in the neighborhood, like East or Sushi Time, for less.",-1
"I work right around here, so have had more than my fair share of lunches at the various Eataly spots. Â I'm generally a fan and it is a handy neighborhood spot, but I find their coffee (surprisingly) sub-par. Where they really are the best is in the freshness of their produce and groceries. Â If I could afford to, I'd be shopping here instead of Trader Joe's! I'm definitely a regular, and will always be heading back here...but also wish there was a bit more variety in their pastries. Allie",-1
"I have ordered picked up so I can not review the waiter or waitress serve. I have tried almost all the older restaurants in the neighborhood. I finally tried here. We made our own kids burger cake and decided to order the burgers here. We ordered for picked up and the food was ready by the time we requested. This is the only spot in the neighborhood with slider choices and the only place I've had so far that had that many options.They had 5 slider choices but we picked 3 (beef, bean, fish) with the sauce on the side. My only complaint would be that the food is a bit pricy.",-1
I've visited this place numerous nights after leaving events late in the city. It is absolutely delicious and amazing!! Definitely a Go To Late Night spot!,-1
been going for years. everything is delicious.,-1
"This place is in my neighborhood. Has a decent selection of really good sandwiches. Â The owner also cooks up delicious whole chickens for $6 each. Â These aren't just plain birds he stuffs them with rosemary, lemon and other great herbs to make a truly great dinner for really cheap.",-1
"Nyonya is probably the only authentic restaurant that serves SE Asian cuisine in the City. You know by the number of Singaporeans and Malaysians that dine there. Ask any one of these ethnic groups where they dine and they'll all say, ""Nyonya."" Food is very tasty and inexpensive... ""Local"" faves include kueh teow, laksa, chicken rice, and chendol for dessert! Forget about Penang... This is the only place to go.",-1
"It's when you've acted as a punching bag all morning at work and you need a break. Cue in the lobster roll combo and you shall see rainbows and unicorns. I don't know about you, but I am all for treating my tummy to quality food when life is crazy. Good food grounds me, na means? P.S. I originally took off 1 star because $20 is more than I will ever spend on lunch but $20 sounds just about right when we're talking about a late night dinner at the office...on the company's tab. So I'm tacking on that extra star for all the Corporate America Employees (Slaves) out there! I feel for ya!",-1
"Very nice restaurant. Â Clean and comfortable, with superior Mexican food and very good service. The food was really good. We ordered and shared the Omelet De Espinaca and Huevos a la Mexicana, while downing a few mimosas throughout the meal. Â The green enchiladas were really good nice spice not overwhelming and the cheese complemented it well. Service was very friendly, and the atmosphere was great sitting at the bar. Â  Will definitely come back.",-1
Portion was really good for the price. Â Pasta was perfect but everyone noticed that it got saltier as we continued to eat but tasty nonetheless. Â The only major complaint is the long wait 1hr plus on a thur night for 5 of us...even though he quoted 35 min.,-1
Their beer selection is pretty awesome and the atmosphere is always cool,-1
"Best chicken broth ramen I have ever had. The wait can be long here but I got seated quickly because I was rolling solo. I got the tuna sashimi which was amazing and a bowl of the chicken broth ramen and both were amazing. I avoided the spicy stuff but I know a lot of people like it. The buns also looked good but my stomach is not that big, yet. Try to get a seat at the bar to see the chefs in action. There may or may not be a blow torch used in prep.",-1
"Service surprisingly lacked, but the food was pretty darn good!",-1
"I had almost everything in this place, food is a perfect 10, staff is nice and service cant be quicker. BE warned thou, like most wraps / laffa being sold, it is not designed for the average human mouth, if you have a mouth that in diameter measures more than 6 inches when open then you will have no problems, but if you dont and you try to eat this laffa you have a good chance of needing an immediate shower, and possibly a urgent visit to the dry cleaners or laundromat. Â  Their pita on the other hand is perfect, nice and tight so you can eat with piece of mind. Dont get me wrong the laffa tastes good but its not possible for 99% of humans to eat that without making a massive mess, you can watch people there struggle Â to eat it, and honestly when I eat I prefer to enjoy the meal and not try to juggle and control a laffa. Worth checking out BUT do not get any laffa wraps here.",-1
Nothing great. Would rather have a slice at any other NY place. Sorry.,-1
AWESOME!!! Â From the Drinks to the food it was all very well done and of course having Jim Cramer running around doing everything from silverware to plates helps:) All kidding aside the drinks were special I had a Tequila infused with Jalapeno was fantasic. we started with the short rib tacos - tasty as can be. Â Also had the guac and chips. For entree we both shared the chicken skewars and the lamb chops. Both cooked to perfection and very tasty. Really what a Yelp Five Star should be - and very reasonably Priced!,-1
"We enjoyed ourselves very much at Buttermilk Channel. We visited for the first time this past Saturday night. The night we visited was the Delmonico Ribeye special which comes with duck fat hashbrowns. Two in our party ordered the special, it was beyond delicious! I had the fried chicken and waffles, which was good, but not great. I don't think I would order it again. The other person in our group ordered the bacon wrapped trout. She loved it! Because of our long wait, an hour wait turned into 1 1/2, we were given free snacks as soon as we were seated at the table. They consisted of homemade pickles, hushpuppies and maple bacon almonds, all of which were great!",-1
"Believe it or not, good pizza is hard to come by in NYC.(The best pizza often comes from Brooklyn, Staten Island and some parts of Queens). Â Thank God for Lombardi's Â Pizza, PIzza 33 (the owner is from Staten Island) and Harry's Italian Bar (Financial District). Â You can get outer borough NY style pizza at these places. Lombardi's is in a prime location and you will like the Italian pizza parlor feel of this establishment, especially if visiting NYC from another town. I have never eaten a bad slice of pizza from here - the food is consistently consistent unlike many other NYC pizzerias. Â  I highly recommend visiting - you won't be disappointed. Â I just don't frequent this place as much as I used to because there's a long wait and you can't make a reservation ahead of time. Â If you've never been here, you have to at least try it once.",-1
"I'm Asian. So most of the non-asian people here in the city think this place is awesome, but it's whatever. There are better places to eat Chinese in Manhattan.",-1
Pizza on a cracker is what I call this place.....nice people work here and I love sitting outside.....mushroom pizza very good....like the polpette meatballs too....consistent and popular,-1
best pizza in history!!!!! sooooooooooo goood! Â def not for those on a diet!,-1
"I don't like writing bad reviews but I feel compelled. Â I decided to come here with 2 friends based on the number of great reviews. Â All three of us eat out EVERY night...If an italian restaurant can't get the meatballs in tomato sauce right, should they be doing anything else? Â The meatballs were tough, and all of us at the table thought so. Â The eggplant appetizer needed seasoning and the sauce it came in had no flavor. Â I had the fillet of sole entrÃ©e which was a disaster. Â It tasted fishy and there was a brown pile of diarrhea looking (and tasting) substance on top of the fish..... not appetizing... I did not eat it.... Â am going back to my usual dining locations.... sometimes different isn't always better...",-1
"You may balk at having to wait 60-90mins for a table at this restaurant but one look at the Asian-heavy clientele and you should know that it's worth the wait. Don't fret if you're starving though, grab a couple of beers, order some pork buns to tide you over and wait... lunch sets are pretty good value, and if you come around 10pm, you usually don't have to wait that long.",-1
"LOVE this place! Â (So happy to have somewhere other then Champion- cooler than thou- can't even say good morning baristas)They make a great latte, interior is fabulous and most of all-they are so sweet! The owner is great. Can't wait til they serve wine.",-1
"burger good a little small for bun temperature a little off lost flavor over time, started out juicy in five minutes lost flavor. fries are good overall ranking: B",-1
"Good ramen and a decent atmosphere, very lively.",-1
"What a great Surprise! Â  a rain delay prompted an hour with a pint at this lovely old bar just a block away from the Intrepid, on Eleventh Avenue better known for strip clubs than Irish pubs. Â  (with an impressive array of Scotch) Â  Original tile floors, a tin ceiling, and wood paneling, too. There are a few sturdy wooden tables by the windows up front and the food looked really good from what I saw. Â In back there's a Â classy dining room with exposed brick, white tablecloths and candlelight. Â I would definitely make the trip to come here again.",-1
"I was excited to try Cafeteria and am always eager to eat in NYC. Â I joined my party late one Friday morning just moments after my friends had ordered, and it took the waiter 10 minutes to bring me a menu and another 10 minutes to take my order. Â My food came out 25 minutes after I ordered, which is an unusually long and unacceptable wait for any restaurant - especially one with ample serving staff and one third of the tables full. Â The spinach eggs benedict were fine, but required more seasoning to my taste. Â Overall, the experience was lukewarm at best. Â I felt as if my business was not appreciated nor was I - or anyone else at my table - a priority for the dramatic serving staff who seemed to be occupying their time elsewhere (which is confusing, since it also didn't appear to be at other tables).",-1
This is my new favorite sushi joint. Â I love how all the rolls are vegan. The spicy mango roll was awesome. Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place,-1
"It would probably be better food if they spent more time focusing on their menu, instead of trying to herd people in and get you out as fast as possible. I know there isn't a huge Indian population here in the city, but for what it's worth, there are awesome places in the financial district that serve better food for the same price.",-1
"Went here with my wife a few years ago and enjoyed the food very much. Â Then I went here again last week and it did not disappoint! Â Great cheese plate, nice wine selection, good service and wonderful ambiance! Alot of restaurants on 2nd ave have come and gone recently with all of the construction, but I am glad this one has survived.",-1
"I am Greek and I love all kinds of sea food! Yesterday, at the fish restaurant of Eataly I had sea urchin slightly roasted on a porchini which was one of my best lunches. The plus was that I was seated at a table in front which had a ""view"" of all tourists and clients that come to visit Eataly as an attraction. It was as if I was at an open piazza, where you get to watch people walking up and down. Can't wait for my next time!",-1
"The pizza is as good as the hype says and the service is actually very nice, an old Brooklyn feel, given how few people are working and how huge the demand is! The hubs was craving pizza (no surprise there) so I asked the friend we're staying with where to go. She recommended Di Fara and we were on our way... it's almost funny how quickly we rallied. No sooner had she said ""world famous"" then the screaching of our rental car tires were speeding away. She warned us about the wait, but we are a patient people. I will come back again and again and again for this. Don't complain about the wait. Your food is worth it. If you're upset about it, go to dominos.",-1
"Love this place! Great Italian food. Everything (but the drinks) is family sized, best for large groups or ...a couple with big appetites :) just go, if u hasn't gone already. Highly recommended. We've had many of their plates, including the Fried Calamari, salad, Chicken Cutlet, many of their pasta dishes and their sandwiches - far too many to name (or remember by name). And we have never been disappointed. This is coming from a very critical, sauce-in-the-veins, pure Italian family. So take heart. They serve ""family style"" portions, very large. My family of 5 (sometimes 6 or 7, if there's a significant other or two) is more than satisfied with ordering 2 family style dishes. I will continue to return as long as taste, quality & service is not compromised.",-1
Overall great experience great atmosphere enjoyed the food and service was good definitely will be back,-1
"I am soooooo happy I found this place!! Fabulous menu (a bit eclectic), great drinks (and beer selection, served in mason jars) and just an overall chill, cool vibe. If you're into coffee, espresso they have a big selection of this as well. The yucca fries and kale salad are DELICIOUS! Staff is extremely friendly. Haven't had the pleasure of being here when there's live music but hopefully next time! Great for big groups.",-1
"Delicious noodle!! Its worth the wait, if you don't like waiting not the place to go. But if you want the best noodle in the city this is the place. Must go",-1
pizza was good but to be honest the plain the better i felt sometimes too much is too much for instance i dont like cherries on my pizza or limoncello on my pizza... other than that delicious!,-1
"I head great things about this so coming here I was pretty hyped about it. Its two carts but people flock to taste it. I tried it, and boy was it delicious! I've tried Halal food before, but nothing like this! This really is the best and tastes the best! The portion is big, the cost cheap, and my satisfaction at a high 110%! Its very delicious and you should try it out if you're ever in NYC. If you're a health-conscious, avoid this place. One serving of this food contains a enormous amount of calories, fat, and carbs. Definitely not for good for those trying to lose weight or stay healthy.",-1
"Great sandwich shop in the area. The cheese is the high point of this place, and the smart duck like everyone says is great. Very unique and the grocery items they sell are exotic and hard to find in the area.",-1
"Having eaten here at least a dozen times in the past twelve months, this is my goto place on a cold or rainy day. Â Nothing feels as good as a hearty beef broth with chili oil and noodles. Â  I'm a huge fan of their Shanghai noodles with tender beef and big Wontons. Â In fact, I think it's the best chinese beef noodles I've had in the city. Â The wonton are the size of large dumplings and the beef is tender and full of flavor. Â The other dishes served here are fine, but the star attraction will always be the beef noodles. Â  My only gripe with the restaurant is the wait staff. Â Inattentive, lazy and depressing; no wonder they wear colorful hawaiian shirts to even out their sour attitudes. A note to those that's been going to Wonton Garden's for a while. Â You might notice that their noodle soup bowls for have gotten smaller. Â It's still more than enough to stuff you, but it definitely less than before.",-1
"i come to this place a lot... usually weekends. Never, ever! been treated so bad. I've been there on hectic, busy times.... Valentines night, i know, it's packed. No excuse to be mistreated by the Hostess and her angry attitude! Â Busy night? She should be able to handle it, that IS her job... Bad start. After that we can't complaint much. Sweet waitress and attentive staff even though the food took ages to get at our table. I always liked el almacen, the service been always pretty good... Bummer!!",-1
"Good steak tartare pretty pricey and can get pretty loud. Â I like to just sit at the bar when you can get a seat and have some apps and beers, good people watching.",-1
"I'm usually very thorough about finding a great restaurant after reading a good portion of the reviews but i was so disappointed when we finished. I found the place horrible. it fits about 6 tables, 3 tables seat 2 people each and the other 3 fit 4-6 people. It's more of a happy hour bar and restaurant. The only good thing was the jambalaya. The french fries were overly salted, the chili with the works was too watery and my friend couldn't even finish 10% of it. The pulled pork sandwich was bland which we also couldn't finished. Also the menu board is on the wall and very difficult to read. Last but not least, the check was incorrectly calculated and charged us about another entree's worth. I felt bad about staying at our table and not being able to give it to another group of people who were waiting but we had to straighten out the bill. It was absolutely horrible from the start and I felt so bad for recommending this place. Proceed with caution here.",-1
Nice Pizza ....V,-1
"Pretty solid pizza place. It has all of the features of great pizza--fresh ingredients, tasty sauce, thin crust, etc. The place is nice and the service is wonderful. The location is very convenient to so many means of transportation and the delivery is always prompt. I love that they have classic mini glass coke bottles and the tiramisu is authentic and delicious. I recommend the pie with truffle spread and prosciutto.",-1
Nice place,-1
"As a regular diner at this place I will be honest with you- Robertas is mad cool. The long low wooden tables are just my taste, I like a place with awesome food and not a lot of show. The selections of beer and wine are nice, they have super expanded their seating in the back and outside where there is another bar... and then they have events they are super fun and cool. Again, cool. Everyone who works here and eats here looks so cool. Sometimes its a bit annoying and people are putting on airs everywhere, but I can deal with it, because the food is AWESOME. The food is $$$, dont get me wrong, but so many items are local/fresh/grown BY ROBERTAS that I think it's worth it. Simple dishes with tons of flavor. The cuttlefish and the scallops are perennial favorites, and all the pizzas are good- order 3 with a group of 4 and get a lot of awesomeness for cheapish. The service has never been 100% on point but the place is usually mobbed by all the wealthy artists in the area with no where else to go (yet) that is as cool as they are. There is often a wait by the bar which is cramped but again, I can deal, because this place is just so cool.",-1
"I went here again and I have to qualify what I said earlier. Â The restaurant has a new chef and I don't think polenta is his or her forte--it was burnt and the flavors didn't hold together. Â On the flip side, the spring soup was delicious as usual and so was the chicken. Â The market salad was also weaker than usual. Â The proportions of the various greens were off so that the flavors weren't blending together. Â  It's still really good food and a wonderful ambiance but it may take a few weeks to iron out the kinks.",-1
"Too many Greek places have exactly the same 15 things on the menu. Pylos differs considerably. Yes, it does offer many of the old classics, but it offers most of them with fresh twists that often improve upon classic presentations and are always interesting. Pylos also have some dishes that seem unique to it. They may not be ""Greek"" dishes in terms of being well-known but they are ""Greek"" in terms of ingredients, seasoning and preparation technique. Yummers.",-1
"We came across this restaurant while trying to find another, and we were glad we popped in. The decor is great - dark, full of character. Food is excellent and reasonably priced, and the wine we were offered was perfect for the food we ordered. This is quite a new restaurant, but it's worth trying for the great location (near Tribeca Grand) and the welcoming staff and good food.",-1
"Great restaurant, its always nice to see the cuisine of nz and au elevated to a classier state. The foie was incredible but then when is it not and the parsnip soup had a nice touch of curry. For mains the pork belly and pickled daikon dish was superb! The miso is so subtle yet transforming. And for dessert look no further than the hokey pokey ice cream, a true kiwi classic that is hard to find in the states.",-1
Not bad. I liked it. But my friend was not too impressed.,-1
"This is a very comfortable, cozy restaurant, excellent food, and perfect for brunch. Â They dont take reservations, but usually the wait is not bad, and if it is there are plenty of restaurants in the area to try. Â Everytime I've ordered fish there, it was excellent, fresh and perfectly cooked. Â Casual.",-1
"Woodrow's is my new favorite watering hole-- and I haven't even been to trivia night yet. Friendly, fun, neighborhood place where you know most of us just work in the neighborhood. Enormous improvement over the hell that was Biddie Early's. Incredible beer selection (20 taps?) from IPA to stout, with seasonal specials. Owner seems to always be there, which is a good sign, and service from the bar or waiters is Â quick and professional -- not like you are bothering them. Stop in grab a pint and have a chat. Great pub feel in a pretty unwelcoming part of the Â city. Cheers!",-1
"I hate to admit it but I've walked through blizzards to get this pizza. Â I wake up in the night and have pregnant woman cravings for this pizza, mind you I have never been pregnant. Â And it is probably the only thing stopping me from moving out of the ghetto. Â The atmosphere is great and the service is really good. Â Especially this one dude who we had once when we went in for lunch. Â The guy noticed every little detail and working in the industry I notice and appreciate these things. Â I came in for dinner once and order things other than pizza, they were all pretty good too. Â The only thing I was disappointed with was the olive oil dessert.",-1
"Though Chop Shop is located slightly out of the way for the non-Chelsea dwelling crowd, here you'll find a cozy nook that's got an interesting take on some solid Asian fusion. Â Both Thai and Chinese influences lead to a lot of yummy dishes that combo some great flavors. Â We came here shortly after they opened and had not gotten their liquor license yet, but they graciously suggested places nearby where we could grab some beers or wine to bring in and have with our meal. Â The one downside is that the portions are on the small side so you'll want to order several plates to fill you up. Â Overall we were met with a generally friendly staff who were happy to talk about their new menu and provide us with some suggestions. Â As an added bonus for the spring/summer months, they have a nice outdoor garden space in back. @datenitenyc",-1
I went for brunch and we almost lost our reservation because my friend was running late (they only hold reservations for 15 minutes). Thankfully she made it just in the nick of time. I had the sigsig (pork bits and pieces) served on a cast iron skillet with a freshly scrambled egg. It was delicious. Service was also great.,-1
The food quality is very high and all meal have very good taste staff and crockery etc very beauty full.,-1
"ambience was cool, the setting for the No reservations ending scene, and the service was serving us, not warm but cool like the cool city vibe, so fine, we had the branzino, No cleaning it off the bone for these servers- self service- like you better know this, and some great california red wine, we also had the classic 'sliders, and not sure what else, but sorry-we went back in the spring- but it was definitely well done. The kitchen must like and know good food- so they seem to know how to cook well, the spot is small but cool, like the service.",-1
The best korean spicy seafood I have had in NY,-1

"Small, crowded Smith Street boÃ®te filled with locals. Simple great basics for brunch and a high tolerance for children and noisy adults. Fun to people watch along with your eggs Benedict or Florentine and good coffee. Kids love the pancakes, sandwiches and relaxed atmosphere. Here several times a year when in town and feel at home.",-1
great atmosphere and selection,-1
"Went here for the first time last night after hearing some good things. Â I have to say, I can't agree more with the positive feedback. Â We started with the mozzarella and roasted peppers. Â The cheese was perfectly salted and dressed. Â The fresh pasta, we both ordered for dinner was perfect. Â I had the tagliatelle with artichoke hearts and a light tomato cream sauce. Â It was perfect. Â The pasta was fresh, cooked perfectly, and delicate. Â The sauce was not too heavy. My wife had the tagliatelle with the pesto sauce. Also delicious. Â Overall very impressive. Â  The other huge thing about this place, its really really reasonably price. Â Almost all dishes in the $10-$12 range. Â We'll be back.",-1
"Bacon and whiskey, what's better than those? Knob creek rye is a must try. Cool place.",-1

THE SQUARES!!!! Amazing!!!! best squares in NYC hands down Sauce on top? Chicago style? No --- NYC L&B style --- DELICIOUS,-1
"It is not a huge restaurant, nor do you feel as if you are sitting on the laps of the other diners around you. The food...excellent! The staff, very friendly. Location. Very convenient. Take the N or Q train towards Queens to Broadway. Walk to the street level and a there you are! My favorite dish? The shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. Delicious!!",-1
"A trendy/typical LES lounge. I like the atmosphere.. I don't know how my friends found this place but I enjoyed my time there.. Lychee martini was good. Crowd asian/mixed. I did see some cute faces there( girls and guys). Summary, nice lounge, Â good drinks, attractive faces... that's a 4 stars for me.",-1
"This is a really nice place to eat, especially if you are an adventurous eater. The variety is great, the food is consistently good and the service is friendly. I star off because the place is so small there is often a wait for a table.",-1
"ok THE CORN. That's all I need to say here. The grilled corn is delicious. As soon as you enter this place you feel like you're in a small puerto rico. I've been going every since i moved to NYC and I always bring my friends and family to show it off... love this place, always delicious, everytime!",-1
"LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! One of our favorites in the city. We've visited on several occasions and each time has been exceptional. Sit upstairs for a calmer, quieter experience. Downstairs is a bit of a madhouse. Delicious food, great wine, affordable prices.",-1
one of my favorites,-1
"I went to this restaurant on Tuesday with my cousin, and it was amazing! We ordered the 'thai iced tea' which was yummy (must have), and had some wonderful thai dishes which were bursting with flavour. It is a little crowded, but its certainly worth the visit, and we didn't have to wait to get a table. The restaurant has a gothic/chic decor, and we had no idea there was so much more room at the back! Service was courteous and prompt, and I would definitely go back there again!",-1
Friendly service. Amazing food-the appetizers were a welcome surprise to the wonderful meal that followed. the fried chicken is as good (better) then they say. Seasoned perfectly. You don't need the side of honey that comes with it. The duck was moist and the vegetable puree with it was a great melding of flavors. Will definitely go back!,-1
This place doesn't have a lot of vegan options but the Chiquita sandwich can be! Â It has pickles and avocado and is delicious. Â I took mine to go from the takeout window that is conveniently located on the street but the inside of the restaurant looked very welcoming.,-1
"Really nice choice for a Â big group of people. We share a lots of food and also sangria We didn't spend no more than $60 each The vibe was perfect , and the music was great!!",-1
"Had an amazing breakfast, especially enjoyed the homeade tater tots in the breakfast bowl, and although the atmosphere was clearly too cool for me, I never felt uncomfortable. Service was great, coffee was outstanding.",-1
"When it comes to sushi, I know a lot of people who are hesitant to call vegetarian varieties ""sushi"" at all. However, unlike regular sushi, I find that the rolls here have so much flavor and character that they really don't need much wasabi or soy sauce. The Spicy Mang roll we shared was inexpensive, and delivered layers of spice and flavor. Perfect on its own, unlike many bland rolls from mediocre sushi establishments of the same price level.",-1
"These dumplings are awesome! Go for the boiled ones instead of the fried...they tastes so much better you can taste the dough more! Super cheap you can't go wrong. Â And filling. Â And don't expect the best service of course, just expect it cheap and fast and be happy with what you got.",-1
"While I don't think it's the best pizza I've ever had, I still think it was pretty good. Â On a Wednesday night around 7:30 pm the place was about 80% full. My friend and I got the large Salsiccia (tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage, basil). Â Delicious but needed a bit more cheese.",-1
"This place was pretty packed at 9 pm on a Tuesday night. Â I think the tables to sit at to eat were all full. Â  I think this place is somewhat confusing....no one had any idea where to pay. Â  I went to the chocolate counter and bought a piece of each chocolate (about 1/2 pound for $23). Â The lady helping me out was super nice but the one piece of dark chocolate I had, really was not that good. Â It was soooo sweet. Everything is super pricey here, so I don't think I'll be returning to buy their stuff. Â Maybe to try the food though.",-1
Oh the Oxtail!!! Â Oh the Oxtail!!! Oh the Oxtail!!! Â Oh the... I can't recall anything after that other than there was still money in my wallet & we'd had virtually nothing to drink!!,-1
I mean it's nothing to write home about and a little pricy but the food here is always good. I've tried most of the menu and never had a bad experience.,-1
"I'm definitely a fan, having moved to New York a few months ago, I've been here twice already and all the food has been great. The service could be a little bit better at times, but the food is so good I'm ok with it.",-1
"From the outside it doesn't llok so, but the place is really really nice and the atmosphere really intimate. The servers were very helpful, since we didn't know too much about Lebanese cuisine. The hummus was reeeeally good!!!! If I lived in NYC I would definitely go back!!!!",-1
"When we walked in, it was quite noisy. And this was a week night. Place was packed. We ate upstairs which was a little quieter, but not much. Then again, I can put up with noise when you have great food. Service was unpretentious but attentive. What was good? What wasn't! If you like garlic, you must try the garlic chile spaghetti. Outstanding! We split it as an appetizer after the grilled peach salad. The sea bass was good, but the char was really good. And the olive oil cake was delicious. We were stuffed when we left, but had to try as much as we could. It was worth it.",-1
"da buon italiana quale sono so giudicare bene il food, e diciamo che questo ristorante non se la cava male..ho preso un`antiasto della casa e delle pappardelle alla fiorentina il tutto accompagnato da un buon bicchiere di chianti... everything went well",-1
So close to awesomeness. Â The location is perfect with indoor and outdoor seating. Â It is very nicely decorated and the wine selection is great. Lovely place with excellent service. Jorge is a fabulous waiter and will really look after you. The ossobuco was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Loved the shaved broccoli salad. Also great wine selection. I will definitely go back for wine and dessert!,-1
"I had the bahn mi sandwich that everyone recommended. Â The sandwich was great, a nice change of flavor of the regular cold sandwich I get from the next door supermarket. Â A three star is for the poor service, food wise it's a good for the price.",-1
"Ok i will go directly to the point: chicken in bun...just order 2 orders and you will be happy for the night..SO GOOD. the restaurant is beautiful, service is fantastic and the food is really worth the hype. I've been to the east village location and this one is much more fancy and clean. Cant wait to go back again.",-1
I dont get the ramen craze. It was all just ok. Try Ivan Ramen on the LES first.,-1
Amazing pizza!. Great location and loce the service!,-1
We really enjoyed the food and would certainly go back but the table at which we were first seated was right outside the restroom - a very unpleasant location. We saw an open table in a better location and were graciously moved upon our request.,-1
"Good food, courteous staff, casual atmosphere and reasonable prices. We felt very at home and enjoyed our evening. Would highly recommend this place for casual dining.",-1
"Love the mushroom tacos, with mass fries on the side.",-1
"Ok, now that's pizza. Some of the best I've ever had, served in a restaurant with some nice candlelit atmosphere and opera wafting through the speakers with the smell of the wood burning oven. Maybe the only thing better than the Lucali pizza is Lucali calzone...soft and pillowy, with fragrant marinara on the side. Worth the price and the wait...we gave our names and had cocktails at Brooklyn Social, they called us when our table was ready. Great Brooklyn night!",-1
"I've had brunch there quite a few times and everyone is always very pleased with their food. I've had a couple small issues with the manager explaining silly rules for large groups. We even left once, but their food and nice covered back garden makes us go again!",-1
Long lines but great pizza,-1
"greedy owner! stay away guys if my tapatio hot sauce says 'made in mexico"" i wouldnt throw off my customers by saying 'imported from mexico. these guys say everything is 'imported from italy"" more like imported from costco! dont be fooled or over pay for your slice of pizza",-1
"My wife and I had just attended an evening meeting of the Dutch Kills Civic Association in the area and then went to Flux Factory art venue. We were not done yet, so we walked by Crescent Grill since they have a small art gallery at the front of the restaurant. Since we had already eaten diner right before the meeting and had cake at the meeting we only ordered an appetizer to share a the bar. We had Duck Balls. I kid you not. I had never seen Duck balls before. They were DELICIOUS. We found out that they serve Sunday brunch. We will look at their web site and see if they list the brunch special for that day. Wait ... just went to site and signed up for their Twitter feed. So now I hope they tweet announce Sunday bunch. Sometimes we don't get up till 1:00pm. So they better say from what time to what time. Oh, over the bar is this fantastic photo of the Queensboro Bridge [the full length of the bar] and more art throughout the Crescent Grill. I think that it is all local artists as we recognized many of the names. Update of Sunday October 27, 2013 We had signed up for their Twitter feed so was notified of Sunday brunch. It says until 3:00PM, so we got up early at around 12:30 Noon Previously we had eaten before going there, but when you go to a restaurant, you should eat at the restaurant, not before you get there. Wife had ""Country Breakfast"". She loved the way the home fries were cooked. I had ""Seafood Omelet"". It was delicious. You could tell in both that only the freshest and best ingredients were used. We had been to a house party night before so wife did not want an alcoholic drink. I had a Bellini which Wikipedia describes as ""A Bellini cocktail is a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach purÃ©e. Originating in Venice, it is one of Italy's most popular long drinks."" It was delicious. We then had their delicious coffee as we chatted and I mused how this would be a nice place before or after evening theater. There are theaters in the neighborhood. So we may have dinner there one evening as this is a very nice place.",-1
This is a super restaurant. We went before going to the theater. Thank goodness we had a reservation because it was packed! Salads and bread was really good. Our entrees were veal picata and chicken picante. The chicken was spicy and super! Desserts looked great but we were stuffed. Very reasonable prices.,-1
I'm really fond of this place! They have about 3 different atmospheres in one place (of course I love the outside garden area) it definitely makes you forget you're in a city for a while. The food is really fantastic! And not too pricey. The lasagna is my favorite because no one really makes lasagna like them! Fresh and delicious it is! La Laterna is not just for heavy delicious Italian food either! You can just enjoy the atmosphere with a cup of good coffee too and possibly a book. This is a great place for a relaxing feel! It's a very romantic place as well so bring your dates here because it'll wow them for sure :),-1
The fries are great and the sauces are plentiful. I opt for the traditional mayo but there are many different ones to try.,-1
"I finally decided to venture over to Lombardi's last week and was not disappointed. Such delicious pizza! And I know there are lot's of great pizza joints in New York, but Lombardi's rank extremely high on the list. I am not to adventurous with my pizza and stuck to a plain cheese, but it was made so perfectly. Writing this makes me want to go back ASAP!",-1
"New York City is know for its pizza, but nothing comes close to the artichoke slice here. Perfect combination of crispy and soft. Don't eat it too much though! It can't be healthy for you!",-1
"The menu is excellent, favorites include; steak frites, scallops and the chocolate pudding. The meal was wonderful, the restaurant had a great atmosphere and service was great. I'll definitely be back!",-1
"I came here based on all of the great reviews. And while I thoroughly enjoyed my experience I can't give it more than three stars. The service was excellent and our reasonably priced bottle of Malbec was delicious. The food was tasty but I found the portions incredibly small in relation to their price. The crispy pork belly was delicious but I only got to taste a sliver! I was also disappointed in the ricotta meatballs and pasta, both were pretty dry. I really liked the free goodies they gave throughout the meal but I would just like to say one thing: this is not a ""fun"" place. I wasn't expecting a club, but when we walked in at 9 on a Friday, it was extremely bright, many of the tables were empty, and everyone seated was over 50. The older crowd was something that took me by surprise as I didn't feel that any of the reviews reflected that. All in all, the food was very well executed and the service/attention to detail was impeccable, but I don't think the vibe fit what I was trying to do on a Friday night. A good place to bring your in-laws.",-1
"Graffiti is chef Jehangir Mehta's delightful Lower East Side restaurant serving super imaginative small plates. Chef Mehta, originally from India, was a former Jean Georges pastry chef. He has since been with several successful restaurateurs and been featured on Food Network's Iron Chef. The eclectic menu at Graffiti offers plates to be shared priced at $7, $12, and $15. The food is Indian in essence but is dressed up with influences from all imaginable cuisines. Each dish is delightful. My favorites were the Zucchini Hummus Pizza & Braised Pork Buns. ""Cozy"" is the word for the tiny space which is BIG on flavors and character. The service is wonderful and super friendly and the atmosphere is really homey. This spot really does have soul and should be on your ""must do list""",-1
"This place is fantastic. Â We often eat at the bar but have also eaten in the restaurant and the service is very professional in both places. Â Reminds me of the service at Gramercy Tavern. Â The soups and crudos are delicate and beautifully presented. Â The pastas are wonderful and unique. Â We've had many of them and I've had the agnolotti several times. Â Fish is prepared very well (cod and halibut) and the tagliatta is excellent. Â Michael White's other restaurant, Marea, seems to get more attention than this one, but for no good reason (perhaps because this is in a hotel). Â Portions are small and light, which is nice. Â  Another bonus is that the Setai Hotel has a great downstairs bar where they provide free nightly jazz. Â It is the perfect spot to hit after dinner (or even just on its own). Â The musicians they showcase are really excellent.",-1
Delicious!,-1
Ramen was good but not as spectacular.,-1
"French fries are my comfort food... so a restaurant devoted only to them- YES PLEASE! Even if I am a meat and potato kind of girl, I am happy to let fried potatos take centre stage and full plate for special occasions. And Pomme Frites is a great place to do that. The frites are just the right amount of crispy. And while I might like my frites a bit thinner (in a perfect world), these aren't too thick; so Ill be goldilocks and say that these are just right for the deal. The massive array of sauces (some mayo based, which aren't my thing; some ranch based- now we are talking...) are impressive and delicious. The location makes it a great place to stop in when you had to skip lunch at work but are on your way to a drink and need to have a bit of reserve to sop up the alcohol you are about to imbibe. It is also a great place to hit after you hit the buzz and are searching for a little bit of grease.",-1
"I loved the black label burger. Â The bone marrow, not so much.",-1
Oyster happy hour! The chicken fried quail is off the charts,-1
"Long Long line. The food is good and you will see that this is the only restaurant with a line that long. The rest of the restaurants do not really match up but at the same time I thought the food was just decent.If you are in astoria and craving greek, this would be your best choice but probably your only choice as well since there really isn't much competition.",-1
I adore the style in which the place is put together. It brings you in to a cozy atmosphere from abroad. I went there on a sunday morning and it wasn't crowded. I didn't enjoy the potatoes as much as i enjoyed the house omoelette. But the waffles did make me smile. I liked the location too.,-1
"One of the best dining experiences I have had in Brooklyn. Place is very small, I suggest arriving early. The bread was incredibly fresh. Fries were perfect. Food was fantastic. Â Corn & Crab Chowder, Fried Oysters, Curry Fish, Tuna Burger were all excellent. Cash only, only down side. Â But this place is good enough to bea a cash only spot. BYOB another plus. Â There is a nice wine store around the corner on Union.",-1
"It's noisy, packed to the gills and very reminiscent of Parisian restaurants with the tables squeezed together. The decor is fabulous. The service is excellent - seamless and unobtrusive. The house wine is very drinkable. We tried the moules frites and the steak frites and were very pleased with each. The frisÃ©e salad with lardons is very good. If you can, save room for profiteroles as they are an amazing conclusion to the meal.",-1
The seating is a bit uncomfortable but you can live with that. Â We tasked to get a better table but there wasn't any available. At least they tell you NO in a very nice way which I did appreciate it. OK it's a French place and God I love the french. We started with that red mustard green salad with feta cheese and octopus. I loved the salad but the octopus wasn't what i expected. After that we had the venison meatballs and the Alsatian chicken! I was blown away. I enjoyed my overall experience! I will return!,-1
"Filipino cuisine - a unique mix of Spanish, Chinese, and Malaysian flavors - doesn't seem as accessible to mainstream American palette as other Asian cuisines. The food here feels home-cooked but is beautifully presented and the ambiance is cozy and colorful. The menu is extensive for a small restaurant and frequent trips to this place by an adventurous eater will certainly make Filipino cuisine more familiar! My favorite is the halo-halo, which is a Filipino shaved ice dessert, topped with ube (purple yam) ice cream laced with sweet caramel and savory kernels of roasted rice. It's the best halo-halo in the city! A must try.",-1
Fabulous place for a quality dinner or lunch. I went to riverpark for restaurant week which is a great time to try a new place and get the most for your buck! Service was spectacular waiter we had was totally approachable and patient with a group of 9 of us. I had radiator pasta with pork sausage kale. salmon with some type of squash basil reduction thing and and peach sundae. Sorry for my amateur description as this was a few month ago and I dont remember the details. BUT I RECOMMEND 100%!,-1
"We recently had an event for 25 at the Market Table. It was a dinner in their private room downstairs. The room was lovely, compact, easy to converse between the two large tables, but we were not impressed with the meals. A noodle based appetizer was given high marks, the mixed salad was average. There were mixed reviews on the chicken entree, and most indicated that the monkfish medallions were a bit overcooked and salty. The flourless chocolate cake and berry french toast were both enjoyed by everyone. The service was impeccable. I am willing to go back and eat upstairs in the restaurant, because it can often be difficult to get twenty five entrees cooked and served all at once.",-1
"Went to Ilili for Summer Restaurant Week recently and was happy with the all round experience. Our waiter was fairly new, but was great with his recommendations and an absolute pleasure - had a perfect balance of humor and professionalism. A lot of the dishes we had - Chicken Liver, Lamb Shoulder - were VERY rich but balanced out well with the yoghurt sauces etc., and lighter dishes lik the Octopus and Cod were a good contrast. All made for a very affordable dinner with a bottle of wine, definitely enjoyed it and would gladly recommend to a friend.",-1
"et's put it this way: I had hyped up how good dinner would be in my head for weeks before finally eating here. And it was still amazing. Then, I hyped up how good brunch and dinner a second time would be despite knowing how dangerous overhyping food is. And again, still amazing. There is nothing that Andrew Carmellini, pastry chef Karen DeMasco, and all those LV bartenders can cook/bake/concoct that is short of utterly delicious. Since you definitely want to try everything on the menu (food and cocktail alike), I recommend going with a larger group (despite having to wait a couple of weeks for your reservation) so that you can taste everything. Or you can do what I do and compulsively go back every other week, pretending like I can afford it. But can you really put a price on a meal that could allow you to die happily? Ok, this may be a slight exaggeration but the point is, the food is Good. Real Good. appetizers: - ricotta - a Carmellini classic that you definitely want to try. Even the toast itself is stupidly perfect. - lamb sliders - only two per order, but eat this. entrees: - grandmother's ravioli - not your ordinary ravioli. this guy's grandma knows what's up. - orechiette - the broccoli rabe lends a really nice crunchy texture and vegetable element that most of the other pasta dishes lack - gigatone - mixed into a hearty, deeply satisfying ragu - papardelle - lamb bolognese topped with ricotta. great stuff. - porchetta sandwich - infinitely superior to Porchetta's version, constructed from thin cuts of juicy, well-seasoned porchetta and gooey melted provolone. - chicken dinner - must come back to try this. I hear it's a winner. desserts: - lemon tart - nicely textured filling with a rich lemony taste - almond semifreddo - the best thing ever. - panna cotta - heavenly. - fantasia di cioccolato - it's delicious gelato, but nothing particularly worth trying. right. So, I generally don't condone absurdly long reviews but I've made an exception because I simply can't contain how much I love this place. Do yourself a favor; eat here.",-1
"Definietly want to make a reservation, this place is super crowded but the BBQ is really good!",-1
Good,-1
"Pork dumplings and the peppers.. Obviously show up early as it's always packed. If you like Raamen, definitely a great choice. I also recommend hitting up the small bar in the front of the house, great bar tenders! HOLLER WITH A DOLLAR, pW",-1
"There's always a wait at this Chinatown location, but you can try to pass time by going next door to the Quickly bubble tea shop first. The delicious crab meat & pork soup dumplings are a must-have item. Service is efficient, but you are likely to have to share a table with strangers and cash is the only accepted form of payment.",-1
"Place is pretty small with only about 7 tables and maybe 8-10 seats at the counter. Diners are mostly alternative type young people but you get families with young kids and older folks like us. It has a neighbourhood vibe which is quite inviting. All feel welcome. I really like their Quinoa salad, and I tried their tuna salad which is new...tasty stuff. No alcohol; decent coffee (barista offering freshly brewed expresso, cappuccino, etc). Their vegan baked goods (cakes, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, and more) are very good...their cheesecake brownie is truly delicious and rich, and great for sharing.",-1
their pad thai noodles are the best!,-1
"Great treasure in the W. Village! Â A ""gastroteque"", a marble counter bistro dedicated to seasonal food and wine. Â Delicious cozy ambiance, great little dishes, like coming to a well prepared French picnic. Â Little plates: great cheese selections, charcuterie, nice hot plates of stewed lentils with kale or coq au vin. Â Came with a friend, sat at the bar counter and had wonderful cheese and chicken liver pate, and the rabbit confit, and lentils. Â Spectacular food. Â Although our young waitress at the bar was somewhat inexperienced and forgetful, although well-intentioned (we think she was training), we'd come back in a heartbeat. Check out the website: ilovebuvette.com",-1
"One of the best New York style pizzas I've ever had. Thin crispy crust, hearty tomato sauce, cheese, basil. What more could you ask for? The service was good too. We asked to be reseated away from the kitchen, and they were kind enough to oblige. The staff was young, friendly and polite. The ambiance was very nice, and they had a nice selection of drinks.",-1
"Fortunately for me, they just opened up a location at the corner of 2nd ave and 14th street. I had walked past it for about a month on my way home from work. The long line forced me to buckle down one day and try it - and boy am I happy that I did! The chicken over rice is amazing. The pita they give you is really soft and delicious. And they give you tons of food for a cheap price. I highly recommend stopping here next time you pass it!",-1
Good place to stop and grab a panini....iced coffee is really good as well... Prices are pretty decent,-1
"Hillstone is a solid place for a more expensive date night. Â It's generally populated by business suit wearing types after work and has round booths where you and your date can cozy up and have a romantic meal together. Â They have a very mixed menu from burgers to sushi to pan roasted salmon, so it's a great spot if you don't know what type of food your date likes or both are in the mood for different types of cuisine. Â The higher end, classy atmosphere, the eclectic menu and the large wine list make it a great spot to bring your date. @datenitenyc",-1
"We visited the Little Owl last week and I cannot say enough about our experience at this restaurant. We were 10 minutes late arriving for our reservation and our table had been given away but the manager invited us in and made us feel welcome, moved some things around and we were seated within 5 mins. The food and service was EXCELLENT and we had a great evening...think we were the last ones to leave.",-1
"Food is good but portions trend toward pretty small, the ceviche trending toward extremely small for the price. The service is a little shaky, food took a while, and bread apparently is available upon request only. The space is cozy and nice, stylish wburg crowd.",-1
Fantastic food and exquisite cuisine! I really recommended!,-1
What can I say. Â  It is one of the best italian restaurants in NY.... and it is right around the block from me. Â  Â There are a million specials and everything on the menu is perfection.,-1
Love this place I've been going here for years the lamb is good chicken is good the pita bread is good . There white sauce isn't the real tasiIkyi sauce but pretty close.,-1
"Staff at the door (greeter) was so snooty! Pricey but not unusual for NYC. Although not all the macarons in the display case were whole (without cracks or breaks), the flavors were delicious. Prefer the texture of Marianna's Macarons in Alexandria, Virginia more.",-1
"I made a reservation for 9 people on a Monday night for dinner. Unforunately, they don't seat you until your whole party is present. It's a relatiely small restaurant but has a pretty/trendy/low-lit decor. The service was good despite it being so busy, and the food cameout relatively quick as well. The food is cheap but good!",-1
"We love the tapas style of eating and after reading the reviews and making a quick stop by to check out their menu we booked up and went for dinner. We looked at the menu for about 5 seconds before deciding this was the place for us - The menu really is so extensive and you will argue over which dishes to try as they all sound so, so good. It is a dark, candle lit, beautifully decked out restaurant, kinda dungeon-esque but in a good way! Staff are friendly and attentive enough, the bar tender was really nice and let us try some port before buying which was nice.",-1
The wait is close to eternal Â & the price is expensive but the Pizza is a must try at least once!,-1
"Great atmosphere, great for groups (downstairs) or for a date (upstairs area, overlooking the first floor). I came here with 9 other people and ordered the Whole Shebang - one of everything on the menu excluding the cheese plates and dessert, all for $420. We did the calculation and it turns out to be a $13 savings compares to ordering all the same items a la carte. Not a big savings overall but it took out the complexity of deciding what to order. Overall I really enjoyed the food. Â Given the size of some of the plates I didn't get to have a lot of each thing, probably about a bite or two, but they were flavorful bites. Â Not everything was great - the octopus ceviches was tough and chewy, the oysters were small and nothing special, as were the shrimp & chorizo skewer and the coca with mushrooms, ricotta and truffles cheese. Â Most other things were pretty good but the winners of the night were the smoked mozzarella skewer, crab ravioli, sea urchin risotto, and the braised short rib with beet pasta. Even though I only had a bite of each thing (and not even everything), I was very full by the end of the meal and was glad when we finally got the last plate, as I knew I would be tempted to try anything new they brought out. Â We didn't have room for dessert so I can't comment on it but they had some pretty interesting choices. Great place - I will be back.",-1
"Really fresh and tasty old school pizza but not worth the really, really long wait and super expensive price.",-1
"I've now been here multiple times, lunch time, late night time and snack time. This place definitely benefits from the lack of middle eastern options in the area. Food is passable, 2 stars. Price is cheap, bumps it up to 3 stars. Â If it was located in the city or queens, much lower rating. #oldguysyelptoo",-1
"A very good place for dinner but reservations are a must! We went on a friday evening and although there were several tables available, the manager?? said they were already reserved and he would only be able to seat us if we ordered pizza or appetizers. However, after pulling some strings and name dropping, they were able to seat us in our own booth and were very accommodating. First impression of this place: very traditional Italian and family style restaurant. We sat in the back room which was more slower paced, and quiet enough to have a conversation and really enjoy our meal. It kind of reminds me of the restaurants where old Italian mobs would come and hang out. The waiter and manager (I'm assuming) was very nice and always asked if we needed anything, or if the food was good, etc. The chef even came out to great the customers that he knew which was very nice. They gave us a menu but I was told no one really orders from the menu and don't bother looking at it. Just order the specials instead. Yes, the specials are extensive and takes the waiter at least 5-8 minutes to rattle it out, but it's worth it. Just pay really close attention. Most of the pictures of dishes on Yelp come from the specials menu, so if you see something that you like in the pictures, they're most likely from the special's menu. I wanted the burrata and prosciutto dish as seen in pics on yelp but couldn't find it on the actual menu. That's because it's part of the special and was glad the waiter mentioned it otherwise I would have ordered the boring mozzarella and tomato appetizer that I always order. The burrata was amazing. The fresh mozzarella was stuffed with pine nuts, basil and roasted peppers and a few slices of prosciutto. I devoured this in minutes. The mozzarella was very soft and so was the prosciutto and the filling of pine nuts, basil and peppers added a different texture and flavor to it. I can eat this every day. My bf ordered the chicken soup special. This was probably my least favorite dish because it didn't taste like anything special and reminded me of the vegetable soup my dad makes all the time. I ordered the osso bucco with gnocchi and it was great. It was also the most expensive of the the dishes we had costing $40. If I knew the price, I would have thought twice about it but it's good to try it I guess. The meat was very soft and fell off the shank. I devoured the marrow from the shank. I love the buttery and distinct taste of marrow but I can see why some people don't like it. It was my first time eating gnocchi and I didn't like it at all but it's my personal preference. It was very soft Â yet chewy but I was basically eating a ball of cooked dough...which is exactly what gnocchi is. I would order the dish again though if they can substitute the gnocchi with a different type of pasta like pappardelle or something lighter. My bf ordered the pappardelle rabbit ragu. It was my first time eating rabbit so I was a bit skeeved but it reminded me of duck meat and it tasted fine.",-1
"This is our go-to place for a team lunch with its convenient location in FiDi and great thin crust pizza. The pizza is consistently good but service can be slow if you arrive smack in lunch hour rush. Tip: make a reservation before the lunch rush at noon and order as soon as possible. Even their delivery can be really slow during the peak hours so order early. Their pizza also goes great with a beer outdoors on stone street. Ulysses next door has good beer, but Adrienne's has better pizza so on a nice day get the best of each place and enjoy the weather outdoors.",-1
"Top notch service amazing food great location and ambiance. Â Really want more could you want? Â Went here for my birthday with my husband and in laws. Â Seriously good stuff. Â DEFINITELY get the polenta. Â I dream about it. Â Also, make reservations. Â I will be going back. Â Its definitely reasonable for the entire experience",-1
Great atmosphere - just like a favourite brasserie in Paris except the service here was polite and helpful (unlike Parisians!) with thought through recommendations tailored to their take on me. I had the trout followed by a sorbet - just what I wanted for a light supper - the fish was perfectly cooked with balanced herbs that complemented and enhanced; the mango sorbet was refreshing and cleansing. Highly recommended.,-1
"The sushi is excellent but the service is even better. The waiter was very helpful with recommendations from the extensive sushi and sashimi lists while patiently explaining the etiquette of eating Japanese cuisine. The restaurant is small and busy, so plan ahead. Reservations are a must and hard to come by on the same day.",-1
superb,-1
"Note : 6/10 Food : Good Wine: Ok Ambiance : Interesting! Service : Good Went there this afternoon and didn't have a reservation we've been lucky to get a table though. Ordered scallops, mussels with chorizo and croquetas with goat cheese it was good but I don't recommend the mussels which were good but not worth the price. The lamb was good but a little overcooked. We tried three different wines but didn't find any decent wine to please the food. The dessert were good except that the creme brulee which arrived cold at the table, that's a big mistake considering the ambition of the restaurant. Oh also concerning the ambiance I was really surprised that they only played music from the very early 90s, I still wonder why. The service was better than most of the restaurant I have been to In town, but just good, not great. An other time after I go in a restaurant in NYC I feel like the bill concerns more the walls than the dinner itself. For only 200$ and less in Paris you would have an outstanding and memorable dinner (two people), I don't think you can find the equivalence in NYC and everything I tried at this price remains very average.",-1
"i love this spot,good food. but very small",-1
"I love this place. The arepas are SO friggin' good. And everything else too. Three of us shared two arepas and a salad to start and then had entrees. No dessert, but lots of cocktails. The waitress was great - a darling young lady from Cuba. She was very helpful with the menu and just an overall sweetie pie. We can't wait to go back.",-1
"This is what a tavern should be and more. A very legit neighborhood hangout, but welcoming to non regulars, to have a few drinks and watch the game by the bar. It also gets a nice crowd, all types and all ages but it doesnt stop there. It's also a great place to have a meal that ranges from casual bar food to more varied options as well. I was here with a scout mob deal and it was accepted with no fuss. Service was casual and friendly and my glass of water was refilled without needing to ask. Â I ordered a tuna club medium rare and that exactly how it came out, they know how to cook fish. That it was served on a wheat bread was an added plus with crisp and well done fries, again another plus. The food was fresh and full of flavor and the sandwich was generously made. Â This is a solid choice when you want casual surroundings with the option to eat a burger or a full delicious meal. Its also fairly close to the High Line making it a good alternative to some of the hipster Â high priced options in the area.",-1
Amazing Pizza! you will have to wait for it but it is a must!,-1
super yum,-1
"Fabulous place for a fabulous cocktail! Especially if you go for the 5pm-10pm daily happy hour when drink prices are reasonable. Delicious drinks, nice service and good atmosphere.",-1
Amazing meat!!!! The service isn't the best nor bad. Will go back!,-1
This has to be one of the most over rated places in NYC. I thought the service was awful and the food just not good.,-1
"Great location by the water. Â Cool old tavern vibe, with extremely reasonably priced food. Â When its nice out everyone is out front.",-1
breakfast sandwich is banging!!!,-1
"woohoo...Back in Japan.... excellect service: waiter motivators and times when to serve next dish. grilling fresh vegetable, seafood and meat is their specialty",-1
if i could go 1/2 stars I would give this place 3.5 stars. no complain about the food but i have eaten better italian food. Some dishes were good and some OK. Pasta is fresh & portions are decent sized. I would go back...,-1
"Huge portions, cheap as hell and delicious. Â Is almost always empty when I go, so check it out and keep this place in business!",-1
"Excellent food; fast, efficient and friendly service; very cozy setting reminiscent of small European family restaurants; extremely funny life size sculpture of Venus. We had every kind of whole fish they offer and everything was just great; and don't forget the fried oysters!",-1
"Long wait, but worth it for the great experience and ambiance.",-1
shit,-1
We went to Eataly on a Saturday night. It was so packed and we waited an hour for dinner. But it was well worth it! The market is huge and the energy of the place is so much fun! We had a great time walking around the market while waiting on our reservation. Â The six of us shared a pizza for an appetizer at La Pizza & La Pasta and each of us tried a different entrÃ©e. I would suggest the Casarecce with Short Rib Ragu. I could not get enough of it! Even if you don't have dinner here you should still experience it!,-1
I was not impressed by burger meat was not tasty. overall ranking: B-,-1
"Wow! I have to say: BEST SUSHI ON FRANKLIN AVE! Super clean also! You have see outside, get a beer and try the Quinoa salad. Aboslutely great!",-1
"The Absolute best place for brunch on sunday. Every crepe they make from the savory to the sweet is absolutely delicious. Also, if you happen to be there on a weekend when they are serving their couscous, it is a must try. There is pretty much nothing wrong with this place except that it can get a little crowded and cramped because it is a pretty small restaurant. Once winter rolls around outdoor seating no longer becomes an option.",-1
"Great authentic food for a reasonable price in New York!! The service was great, with very attentive waiters and staff. Â  Pretty good wine and the food was delicious!! Excited to go back!",-1
This place is awesome. The wait can be long (usually 30-45 minutes) but they take your phone number so you can go wander around. Try their grapefruit shochu cocktails. They bring you half of a grapefruit and a juicer! Their yakitoris are great. Definitely check out the lampchops. Chicken skin is worth trying but it wasn't really my thing. The tofu and eggplant yakitoris are amazing.,-1
"Se gosta de culinÃ¡ria italiana, comer bem e beber bem este Ã© o seu lugar em NY! O imenso espaÃ§o Ã© dividido em diversos tipos de Ã¡reas de acordo com os pratos (petiscos, frutos do mar, carne e, obviamente, massa). Ã‰ difÃ­cil escolher em qual sentar, pois todos sÃ£o mais do que convidativos. AlÃ©m de possuir os ambientes para comer, o lugar Ã© um imenso mercado de produtos italianos da melhor qualidade possÃ­vel. Tenho certeza de que um dia Ã© pouco para este lugar! Vale a pena tomar um vinho e pedir uma tÃ¡bua de frios no ambiente de petiscos enquanto espera a mesa em um dos restaurantes. O atendimento Ã© excelente e os preÃ§os justÃ­ssimos.",-1

"This was an interesting dining experience. Â We picked up our eye glasses and had them fitted in Chinatown. Â The tech who adjusted the arms of my glasses asked ""... have you ever tried Vanessa dumplings on Eldridge...?"" Â My response was ""... I do not know where Eldridge Street is..."" After a few rounds of directions on my google maps app, we set off in search of dumplings for a quick lunch. We walked in and it was crowded. Â I asked someone if we need to place our name on a list or wait to be seated. Â NO. Â It is sort of cafeteria style. Â You place your order with the cashier, she punches in your order on a computer screen, a ticket prints out 5 ft to your right and then you wait for your order to be assembled by 5 or 6 people running around behind the counter. Â Once you have your food on a tray (5 minutes later), you look for an empty table. We ordered a roast pork sandwich, a peking duck sandwich, a small serving of hot and sour soup, a noodle soup with dumplings and an order of pan fried pork dumplings (4) - the total was $10.50 .... The sandwiches were good and the dumplings were tasty. Â They could use a zippier sauce (maybe a little vinegar, ginger or garlic in the soy?). Â The hot and sour soup was not spicy or flavorful ($1.50). Â The noodle soup was sort of flat too. Â It did have nice serving of udon noodles and 4 dumplings were tasty but the stock needed some flavor ($3.50). Â We did not finished the noodle soup and had a sandwich left. Â We took the sandwich home, we did not want to stuff ourselves.... This was a nice excursion away from Canal, Mott and Bowery..... Â Granted, you will not get a fully selection of dim sum, but you will get a huge serving of dumplings if it is dumplings you are after.",-1
I love this place for no frills dumplings when I'm in the mood. Â  In order the pork fried dumplings. Â Always quick and very inexpensive.,-1
"This place upsets me bc it is extremely over-hyped mediocre ramen. I am all for waiting for food if it's worth it, but there is nothing special about it. Broth is chicken based, which tastes generic and synthetic. Noodles are chewy but nothing remarkable. Would not go back, even if there was no line.",-1
the pita is terrific: warm and fluffy. the falafel is good. the merguez is spicy and tasty. the dolmathes are fine.,-1
Love this place! Â Everything is always good!,-1
"The ambience is great; festive and loud, perfect for our noisy Mediterranean family. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious. The decor is great with cushions in booths, and palms interspersed throughout the restaurant giving little private oasis spots, in an otherwise tight space. The servers and the service was responsive. We were sat quickly and tended to quickly as well.",-1
"Had a birthday dinner for one of my friends and I really wished I can like this place more. Everything about this place was very mediocre...First off, the music was way too loud in there. We had a reservation for a party of 9 and was placed on a big, round table...and we can barely hear each other and was practically screaming bc it was so darn loud in there. Secondly, the food was very mediocre...Ive had way better hummus and eggplant dishes at beyoglu. Nothing was really tasty or stood out in any way except for the brussel sprouts...",-1
Delicious- I love Moroccan people and their food!,-1
Hands down... my favorite Thai restaurant.,-1
"Since my last review I have sat at the bar a few times. There are two women who work there that are just lovely. Sweet, knowledgable and really take their time with the drinks. Nice.",-1
"Good food, nothing spectacular though. You can get that at any half decent NYC restaurant. Exorbitant prices. Terrible terrible service. Went there for my birthday brunch. They could care less. From the hostess to the server, just awful awful. Very rude, inefficient, indifferent. Right from getting the menu, water, to the check, had to wait so long for everything. When it arrived, they just dumped it on the table with no apology or courtesy. I will never go back. No idea why this place is so famous. Ugghhh",-1
The lamb pastrami and fried cheese curds are excellent. Â The free-flowing whiskeys definitely make the food go down easier.,-1
"For someone who doesn't eat anchovies, I think it's fair to ask why this menu item would be your traditional caesar salad: ""Romaine / candied walnut, pecorino, mint"" I get Roberta's is one of a kind and they've got their own rules, but the pizza isn't worth a schlep to Bushwick for most of us and a place renowned for growing its own produce should be a little more respectful of the vegetarians who mistakenly order the Caesar Salad disguised as a Romaine salad. Get over yourselves, Roberta's. I'm still going with three stars since the service, decor and pizza are all excellent.",-1
"Best burger and fries in ALL of NY if you ask me! I'm not typically a ""burger"" girl but when i'm in the mood this is where i go. Downside: there is always a wait. Upside: There's always the bar.",-1
yummm cheap and delicious,-1
"Love this place, here's why: the roast chicken. Â succulent, lemony, herbaceous. lotta joints the chicken is a bland mediocre option, not here. order it, you'll see. pasta is great too... love eating here on a warm summer night, garage doors wide open... only reason I docked a star is i don't like paying $16 for a martini...",-1
"Hope you're not black if you go here. Was told I had a chip on my shoulder cause the hostess was rude to me and my girl. Couldn't pay me to eat here (they tried) I won't take this kind of racism, not in Brooklyn",-1
"french little cute, the costumed staff were very frenchy cute also. the little cuteness of the plates cups and glasses were little and on the tiny side, but aware that they war very small and cute. the food taste was nice on cute little plates in a cute little room with cute little french looking service who spoke with french adorable accents. We will go again when in the cute village of the west.",-1
"Really bad. Â The flavor profiles of the food are incredibly erratic or not present at all. Â The wine selection is poor and the definitely served me a glass that was at least 2 days old. Â Also, it's super gross to see their cocktail rinse bucket front and center in the window as you walk in. Â Rearrange the bar guys. Â  In addition, I know that people smoke, but it's really gross to watch your servers (all but one at the same time) go outside to take a cigarette break with the woman who's been in the kitchen all night (I would call her the chef or cook, but she wasn't wearing any chef gear and didn't have her hair covered even though she was over the grill the entire time). Â The all went out front together, smoked, and then came back in and started serving again. Â I'm hoping they washed their hands but I wasn't paying that close attention. Â It seems more like a group hang out than a restaurant. Â The music didn't help that vibe either. Â If I'm not mistaken music is supposed to be ambiance right? Â I really don't need your personal preference shoved down my throat and I get some of the big name chefs like to 'play what they would listen to in the kitchen' but honestly are you a big name chef? Â Customer service should be number one.",-1
"We had lunch / dinner including wine and desserts! The Coq au Vin tasted like heaven, the rest of the family enjoyed the burger, the steak and the duck. All of us were exremely satisfied with the choices we made. For desserts we tried the Pannacotta and of course, the Creme Brulee. It was just great!!! The restaurant was crowded and noisy, and looked very french. A really nice experience, and I will definitely visit Balthazar.",-1
"The place to be in if you are interested in Lebanese cuisine. Vegetarians do have some limitation. We ordered for Falafel, Fatuous Salad & Hummus. Fatuous Salad was awesome.",-1
"We went to this little restaurant before heading to a broadway show and the staff were really friendly and happy to help! They ensured the food was brought out swiftly in order for us to get to our show on time. The menu had excellent vegan options (try the curry, the chickpea burger, the beets and the roasted sweet potatoes) but also the salmon cakes were delicious! The roasted cauliflower and the zucchini stuffed with quinoa lacked some serious flavor which was unfortunate. But give the juices a go! If you want to have a delicious, healthy meal with some options for vegans this is the place to go. The setting was nice - make sure you get the table facing onto the street for people watching.",-1
"In less than 48 hours, I've tried the turkey and swiss, the pizza sandwich, and the roast beef-- all delicious! Â I don't think I can pick a favorite, but adding the hot peppers gave my sandwiches today a nice kick.",-1
"Updating my review as now I've been to the downstairs lounge area a few times! Super fun, GREAT djs, room for hanging out and a nice sized dance floor in the back! It gets packed but def a good time! :) Also, the bartenders are all really nice...def a plus!",-1
"Having been here for many a delicious brunch and sunday supper I am very sad to report I will never go back. Took one of my good friends here tonight, having ravedabout it to her. We walked in and there were 2 free tables and lots of room at the bar. Asked for a table for 2, only to be told that there wasnt room and that we couldnt take one of the free tables as they were being ""saved for bigger parties"". So short sighted: turning away repeat, local business on the hope of getting 2 extra covers. Maybe they got that tonight but they will be missing out on my many visits in the future. Fortunately, their loss was absolutely our gain: we went to Porsena on 7th and 3rd and it was out-of-this-world DELICIOUS (much much better than i've ever had at Northern Spy Food Co). I would thoroughly recommend that you give snotty NSF Co a miss and head for proper local fav Porsensa. I know we will!",-1
"The food itself is really good. The chicken was a whole baby chicken patch cocked - really cool twist on traditional chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were great; I loved the combo or jerk sauce and maple syrup. The pork was cooked it was still rosy in the center, delicious and a lot of meat compared to the sides. I loved this place and would definitely come back.",-1
"Great Ramen! Â I love this place and recently tried their 2nd location in Hell's kitchen. Â Both are amazing. Â I did have a not-so-friendly waitress once at the 4th avenue location, but it is not common and she was probably having a bad day. Â Definitely try it.",-1
"Surprisingly impressive. Went here with a friend to just have a drink while we waited for another reservation. The bartender however lured us into eating there (because she mentioned soft shell crab which my friend is obsessed with) which was the best thing we did. She said it was really good. I, on the other hand, had the lamb chops. These were the most amazing lamb chops i have ever tasted! They are so tender and tasty that you will sit there and say to yourself, wow. There is some type of spice rub on it that i believe is where the taste comes from. This was actually a recommendation from the bartender once again. It came with carmelized pumpkin (i'm not a big pumpkin fan) and it was really tasty. We also had the goat cheese salad (with some berries i believe) and this was excellent as well (again, i love goat cheese! I had the lamingtons for dessert - i didn't like it (it was a bit dry), but it didn't really matter to me. So, i would definitely recommend this place, the atmosphere and service is great also (and we sat at the bar). The wine was good too, but staple are the lamb chops here.",-1
This place is AWESOME. go for the roti canai and the beef rendang. The only other place that I know that's as good as this is Penang in Queens. It's also super cheap. Hot Damn.,-1
"I love this place. We come here for special occasions the food is always amazing. The food is wonderful. Standouts are the prosciutto e burrata, the mezza Luna (ravioli stuffed with mascarpone cheese and pesto), and the osso buco. (I don't eat veal...or marrow, for that matter...but my boyfriend swears this was the best he's had outside of Italy.) Not only is the food amazing, the service is excellent, as well. Very attentive, knowledgeable and no BS. Â  The best part is that dinner at L'Incontro is a night out. Unlike most restaurants, where you are given the check the moment you get your dessert, you are expected to spend an hour or two at your table. You are never rushed and never ignored. I'd definitely recommend Trattoria L'incontoro if you're ever in Astoria; and I'll definitely head back, if I'm ever in Astoria again.",-1
My meal was okay but my dining partner chose way better. Â He got the gnocchi and arctic char. Â I started with the octopus which was average. Â  The best part was the ambiance and location.,-1
"I stopped by Juniper with my friend who had a 50% off coupon the other night during the ongoing heatwave (otherwise known as July in NY). I suggested we sit on the patio, and we were quickly, and often served tall glasses of ice water. The patio is very simple, casual, could be anyone's backyard-there was the back screen door (the entrance/exit to the kitchen I imagine), and a few bikes leaning against the wall. There really isn't any sort of ambiance outside. Inside, there is a really cool vintage typewriter (?), and gleaming wood tables and floors that evoke bygone years. Again, pared down but not without charm. Both of us ordered pulled pork sandwiches with sweet potato fries. The barbecue was rich and sweet but not overwhelming, the texture of the meat wasn't too dense. I think the pulled pork can near rival any authentic Southern trailer restaurant in the backwoods (of which I am acquainted with). The sweet potato fries found a convert in me, crisp, hot, and finished within a total of maybe 5 minutes. I was pretty disgusted with myself for the level of gorging, having completely cleaned my plate, and even mopping up any leftover sauce with my roll. I can't wait to go back.",-1
"Americanized Filapino food, but delicious. Â  The Pork Adobo with rice is really really good!!! Â They serve basic sodas with your meal, which you'll need plenty cause some of the food is hot. Â Sevice is just okay, but the food is great.",-1
great place...love the burgers,-1
"Everything is fantastic about this place, very low lights, flowers everywhere, great menu and wines, great service. One of the smoothest spot in the city. Highly recommended.",-1
"I would give 4.5 stars but no such stars so giving 4 stars. Everything is great although it is expensive. I did a Omakase course and I spent $150. Quality of the food, conversation with the chef, and the service was exellent. They even help you to wear a coat when you leave. Nothing really disappoint you. This must be the number 1 sushi restaurant in NY. The reasons why I took a half star are that the host could be nicer and professional. Not saying he wasn't but for this kind of highend restaurant, he could be better as for the way he talks to a customer when he takes a reservation. Also I felt I was rushed to the outside before I closed my coat.",-1
Went with a few friends over the weekend. Â One person in the group got the gnudi appetizer and it was really amazing! Â Can't go wrong with that. Â Another got the corn chowder with chanterelle mushrooms. Â This was also very good but pretty overpriced. Â For dinner I got the pan-seared squid with a nice tomato salad on the side. Â The squid was very good - a bit of a pop! Â BF got the berkshire pork belly - he loved it. Â Good beer selection - we tried the cask ales. Â Part of me felt I was paying a bit more than I really should have. Â Atmosphere was kind of raucous since there was a really loud party next to us. Â Glad I tried it but may not go back for a while.,-1
"Not only is it affordable, but it is delicious! Â  You have to try it when you're in the city. *The hot sauce is HOT! Use it sparingly.",-1
"On a crowded Saturday, our reservation was honored on time and we were seated even though our friends had not yet arrived. We appreciated the great front desk. Everything was wonderful, but I went back for my birthday grilled lobster with a side of Brussel Sprouts. If possible, it was better than I remembered. So succulent and sweet. We all enjoyed salted caramel ice cream sundae. Decadent beyond belief. Good service, too. The only downside is the high noise level in the room. But, it's worth it.",-1
"This was one of our best foodie experiences! Cannot recommend highly enough! The food, atmosphere and service was second to none. The tasting menu was fantastic, portion sizes perfect to ensure you weren't feeling too full afterwards. The servers were really knowledgeable and catered perfectly for my wife who is gluten free. Some of the highlights from the tasting menu were the halibut, the oyster chowder and the duck breast.",-1
went there once but i loved it...,-1
Baked beans rock. Pulled pork rocks. Fette Sau's meat ROCKS!!!! Go and get some now!!!,-1
"Lulu & Po served a pretty solid meal with some pretty good wine. Everything was good but not so memorable. I liked the pork belly and the octopus. The rest was good enough!! But pretty expensive for being small and not mind-blowing. I think I would go back if ever in the neighborhood for those dishes mentioned, not the rest. The atmosphere is relaxing and cute.",-1
"Never going back. The waitress was horrible and EXTREMELY rude. The place smelled. Oh, and the floor has sawdust or like, chicken feed all over it. Â Don't know what that's all about.",-1
"I ate here the other night for a friends b-day. The other reviewers were spot on when they said the ambiance / atmosphere was awesome. We came late on a Saturday night, and were able to sit outside on the patio, after having waiting inside at the bar for a table. The food was good, but nothing note worthy. Between our table, we covered the entire entrÃ©e menu (duck, pork chop, steak). None of us were ""wowed"" by the food, but weren't necessarily let down. The one plus is that for a West Village restaurant, it's not terribly expensive. Entree's average about $25, with cocktails being ~$14 and decent bottles of wine going for ~$60. I will definitely come back here, mostly for the ambiance. Great place to take people from out of town, and/or for a date.",-1
"You think you've lived here long enough and know pretty much all there is to know about NYC until someone shatters that by mentioning Freeman's to you and you arrive and you see it packed w/ all the happening NYers and feel so left out. This place almost felt like a movie set, as it couldn't have been better laid out for a cool, quaint, hidden NYC gem. It's hip comfort food if that makes sense, it's quite alright and the portions are huge so don't over order. The artichoke heart dip shouldn't be missed. But this whole place is about ambience and it's as good as it gets. Feels like you are in London at Freeman's.",-1
I got there at the very end of the night and probably ate the last bit of what was left. Â Might be why I got sick. Â The idea is cool but I'm pretty scarred after getting violently ill.,-1
"A welcome addition to the area, and a very cute place to eat. Â The food is solid but nothing revelatory, and having been there twice, I don't think I would go again (but I also don't live in the area anymore). Good: the cheddar waffles with the fried chicken, the grits that came with the trout, a lovely side of english peas in butter with breadcrumbs, scallops, our waitress. Meh: the fried chicken was way overdone, although flavorful. Â Duck meatloaf was tasty for the first few bites, but then overly sweet and lacking balance. Â Ribs had good flavor but were almost inedibly dry. Â The watermelon and feta salad was OK. No wait at 7:00 on a Sunday night.",-1
"A total cool place with great atmosphere. I got to the restaurant a bit before 6pm and within a half hour the place was totally happening. Rock star chef Jonathan Waxman and famous for the fire roasted chicken. Everything on the menu seemed to hit the just right food note. Quality, portion and presentation. the desserts were delicious, too. Super cool garage like industrial loft setting with outdoor eating in Meatpacking packing full of locals with a young sexy vibe. 10 for food and vibe!",-1
Great spot to start of a Thursday night. Happy hour is 1/2 off. The bartenders are cool and yes the LYCHEE Martini is yummy. I will definitely be coming back.,-1
Cheese bread is my favorite ball.,-1
"we come here after work when we've had a long day and want to get hammered. Â why? Â because they have the most ridiculously strong jack and cokes EVER. Â AND they have CRAYONS so you can draw on the table. Â and that helps also when you are trying to divvy up the bill. Â doing long division with crayons while drunk trying to figure out how you are going to pay the bill on the crap salary you are getting paid at your crap job that drove you to drink in the first place will no doubt make you crumble into a drunken pile of mush when you start reminiscing on your childhood. Â burnt sienna. Â best color ever. also, good comfort food and nice service and titanic memorabilia and it's loud and you can be belligerent and no one will judge you. Â at least no one will judge you that you will see. Â because you will have your drunk blinders on. Â thank you jack and coke and the quick servers that keep them coming.",-1
"Another dive, but good burgers. Â Not much else to write about this place, except some claim their drinks are reasonable. Â  Hit and miss, but the burgers usually hit the spot. Â Now that the no smoking order has been in effect for quite a while, this place is more tolerable in the late evenings when tons of geezers would hang at the bar and smoke up all of Virginia's tobacco.",-1
"Been here many times and really enjoy the food quality, waiter's knowledge and suggestions! Plates are small enuogh to have a variety of tastes in one night, but good enough to share. Highly recommend to anyone interested in excelent food in a very nice atmosphere.",-1
"Came here for my boyfriends birthday. I give 3/5 for the experience and a 4/5 for food, because it was delicious and dessert was amazing But I was dissapointed a bit at my first time visiting becco. The restaurant called the night before to confirm my reservations and when asked i specifically mentioned I didn't want them to sing when the desert came aroud which I guess they didn't note down. Luckily I managed to stop them before too much embarrassment. And the second dissapointing thing was when ordering I mentioned I wanted to add the 3 Unlimited pastas to the meal I ordered which the menu did say I could do, but apparently they forgot that too. I ended up just having the meal which was delicious. But for the great ratings this restaurant received I did expect our night to be a little more pleasurable",-1
The service and food here is amazing. I had the chicken salad and it was delicious. Love the cakes they have here as well. Came here with ten of my friends and they accommodated us accordingly. I'll definitely be back in the future.,-1
"First off, the bad things: - cash only Â -sometimes you get overlooked if your server isn't doin it right and there are fancier people or bigger groups or bigger spenders hogging their attention -the place lacks fancy ambiance -there are a few items on the menu that dont totally blow your mind. the veggie tempura is hit and miss, for example. The good things: - its my favorite restaurant in new york because 99% percent of the food BLOWS YOUR MIND, is INSANELY FRESH (and often local) and WAY HIGH quality, the people working there know their stuff, who cares if its cash only there are 2 ATMs right there, and I personally love knowing there is a little hole in the wall that is not focused on looking fancy but wants all your attention on its amazing food. I always bring people here to make myself look smart.",-1
The quality and quantity of the food has changed over there years. The papaya salad was not as authentic but now it has been a lot better.,-1
"I had a very limited amount of time, so asked a foody colleague to give me a few restaurants not to miss. He mentioned Margon, and it was great. Quick, friendly and cheap. There are daily specials - don't miss the Roast Pork on Wednesdays.",-1
"if you come here and get only one thing, let it be their sushi rolls. they are massive and pack a crunch (macadamia nuts) that you will crave from the moment that you leave. the apple dessert is awesome, as is their french dip! seriously havent tried a thing i didnt love at this restaurant! oh, and its not advertised but its BYOB!",-1
"Food was gorgeous, lovely wine, cosy, friendly spot. Lots of people taking snaps outside because its the friends building- unfortunately under scaffolding when we were there. Lovely part of town.",-1
so yummy i would eat here everyday!,-1
it has its own unique style but I wasnt thrilled with the quality of the food nor the service. maybe worth it if your in the area but otherwise go uptown.,-1
"I have been coming here for many years - before the cookbook was like an number one best seller, and a hit on Amazon, before wearing table cloth shirts and ironic facial hair was the norm for men age 20 - 40 in Brooklyn everywhere *cool*, basically before you could open a ""Brooklyn-Aesthetic-Theme Restaurant"" (which of course you can now...even in Manhattan, need proof, go to Fedora, or the Gingerman in MIDTOWN) and once upon a time this was the original...all those things I mentioned exists because places like Frankie's were soooo good everyone wanted to copy it. Unfortunately their perennial popularity has lead to a bit of a slide in quality. But it's still damn fine. So go, just don't mind if they got a little pompous, it's part of the look.",-1
Don't like the shared sitting.,-1
"Great food and price. I really like the Tuesday menu, and the cheesecake is to die for.",-1
"If you are ever in the upper east side at a loss for food choices- this place is definitely solid. My only caution- it is pretty loud in there! We sat near the back and although I usually don't mind this but we came with my boyfriend's grandparents and they could barely hear us, let alone speak to us! We managed and laughed about ""the young people."" Otherwise, the food was great, the standout was definitely the bacon wrapped scallops (over the ricotta gnocchi- which I thought was a bit too rich to down in one sitting).",-1
"This is one of favorites places!! The decoration is beautiful, very fancy, I also like the staff outfit. The service was great!! The food ""as usual"" is very good!! The tuna tartar,the sesame tofu,the shrimp appetizers are one of my favorites. But the best part comes when they bring you the bill. Prices are very,very affordable. Is always a lots of food for few bucks. I go there two or four times a week.",-1
No - seriously.......this is SUCH a great cafe. They have a chicken sandwich with a champagne dressing that is like nothing....nothing I have ever tasted. It takes chicken sandwich to a level of which it has never dreamed. The bread - so crunchy and that dressing.....omg..... Â everything else I have had there is very good. BUT the chicken sandwich....a MUST try.......,-1
"Finally a coffee place that gets it. alot better than that ""coffee place that Â shall not be mentioned"". Not a coffee conniseur, but the pour over coffee is outstanding. It is definetly strong and flavorful. Great Place to hang out and meet people. Not a place to grab a meal though",-1
Good French cooking no games! Chevre appetizer was probably the best I've had. Fillet mignon was tender and juicy! Great place to bring your own wine and eat. Waiter was vey friendly but forgetful and not always attentive.,-1
"Yum, the Pork Banh Mi sandwiches are great. Â The portions are so generous that usually I can eat half for lunch and save half for dinner. Â And, on top of that, for $3.75 a sandwich it doesn't break the bank. Â It might seem like chaos when you first arrive, due to the cult following, but alas you'll soon figure it all out as their English isn't that bad. Â Just be wary of the grannies or other Cantonese speaking people who will more than likely try to cut you in line. Â Oh and they relocated, but I can't remember where.",-1
"I am not sure what the love affair is all about? Â Yeah i agree with the previous reviewer, 2 stars for vibe, ambience. The Food is average at best been there a few times, and it is hit or miss. Overpriced dishes - Â I couldnt believe the price for the portion. I lived in Europe, so i am very aware of what a portion should be, and this was a joke for the money. Cash only, what happened to accommodating your guests? Glass of wine = $13? Â I think I probably paid for half the case at that price! Crazy thing is, I will probably be dragged back there cause it's all the rage - my friends follow TV and Book publishings. I guess thats what the love affair is all about.",-1
love it ! just love it ! food is always good. service too. every astorian should try it !,-1
Great food and wine! Waitress was super helpful on recommending wine and interpreting dishes. Lovely back area. Would come again.,-1
"Meatballs are most always delicious... when cooked right. These meatballs at The Meatball Shop are extremely juicy and full of flavor. The various combinations of meatball flavors and sauces are so unique, yet so wonderful. Highly recommend. Even you are not a huge fan of meatballs I can assure you will become one.",-1
"RabbitHole is another of the many excellent bar/restaurants in hip Williamsburg. At various times we had breakfast, drinks and dinner there and all were very good. It's a laid back, cool vibe but without being pretentious. The food was uncomplicated but flavorsome and good value. We had two different fish dishes for dinner, both great. This is a good little spot a bit away from the more frequented parts of Bedford St but definitely worth hopping a bit further along to the RabbitHole.",-1
"I love de mole! I live very close and go there about twice a month, and sometimes order delivery too. The service is so friendly, especially Luis, who is the most gentlemanly, attentive waiter in new york city! I order the vegetarian burrito and the cheese quesadilla. It's absolutely delicious. On some occasions, I have ordered their fresh juices. They are FRESH...you can see them make it. Â Surprisingly, they have a few vegetarian options on their menu, which is a HUGE plus! It's really affordable in terms of price. It's a cute little place but can get really loud at times. Overall, the meal, service and atmosphere was all really good.",-1
great thai at unbeatable prices.,-1
Best chicken pot pie I have ever had in my life! Great for a group or for a date. The service is good although you might have to wait for a table because it gets very busy here even on weeknights.,-1
Really good - huge queues because they are that good and so popular! We went twice on our trip. Split a dish between us as it is a huge portion. You won't be disappointed.,-1
"One of my favorite places in the city. Everything is perfect. Service is impeccable. even the extra virgin olive oil that came with the bread was spectacular House Made Ricotta Cheese to start - rich and creamy; taste like butter Charred Octopus - grilled to perfection and incredibly tender Squid Ink Fettucini Â - not a big pasta person but this was great. lots of garlic which is great if you're into that Strawberry Pavlova - unlike anything I've had before. Perfect light summery dessert. Great mix of textures - crunchy pastry shell, smooth and rich creme filling, tangy sorbet Always an amazing experience at L'Artusi. Dining in the private wine cellar with sky roof is for those extra special events.",-1
"I've been here a few times, and its been a consistently wonderful experience. I recommend the buttered lobster and grilled octopus. For dessert--I'm not a fan of very sweet treats, but i love their Panna Cotta.",-1
"Wok fried Chili with Shrimp is too sweet for my taste. It is quite salty too. We also ordered the seafood noodle soup, it came out like a diluted sweet and sour soup. Spare ribs were good, but lack of flavors. The location and pricing are very good though. Service is very attentive. If you are in the mood for a quick Thai fix, this is the place to go. But tell your waitress to be easy on the sugar.",-1
"Get the felafel sandwich! The felafel is perfectly crisp. PERFECTLY crisp. I especially enjoyed the pickled red cabbage in the sandwich... it's a nice contrast to everything else. The thyme pie thing was also pretty good. It's a thin piece of flat bread with a thyme sauce and goat cheese. It looks like a pizza, kinda. Oasis is just down the street, and around the corner from Brooklyn Brewery, which makes it the perfect place to grab food to eat at the brewery.",-1
"I finally made to this place after million years.. For some reason I always thought this is an underground teahouse. My first impression of this place was alright. perhaps I excepted something greater. Anyhow, I order Hibisceus ice-tea. something they showed a picture in the menu ( i always go for the pictures) it turned out very good. I'm not a tea expert. I don't know if it's up to the tea standards. All I can say is it tasted good to me.. very fruity. Good place for date!!",-1
"Right in the middle of all the theaters.The menu was wonderful to choose from. I picked the shrimp and saffron pappardelle.special. No rushing, squeezing, and every course was perfect and the flan with fruit and REAL whipped cream was a perfect ending.",-1
"Yerba Buena is a small charming restaurant occupying what is little more than a storefront in Alphabet City. We visited on a slow cold night in December and were greeted with extraordinary courtesy and attention. The food - best described as ""pan-latin"", was creative and at the same time sufficiently familiar to make one feel comfortably at home. While everything we had was terrific, what stands out is the almost ""old world"" quality of the staff - rarely seen these days. Professional and attentive but not cloying or insistant. A real class act. We will return.",-1
OMG best place to go for a quick date. Love this place. The staff was awesome and the price was great.,-1
Gramercy Park + Danny Meyer + Breakfast = great way to start your day :-) All good + amazing espresso. Best bacon I have ever had. Wish I could have stayed another hour. Go and enjoy.,-1
"Mamoun's is a great spot in the village when you have a crave for a falafel sandwich. Price per is running at $3 and that's a great value. This place is open very late, and it's the definitive place to get a post drinking snack if you're in the area. If you're brave enough, get the hot sauce but beware of it since it's deathly hot. The heat is so intense for some that it might really make you sweat. I personally don't put a generous amount, but just enough to give the sandwich a little extra kick. Seating is limited inside to a couple of tables and there is an additional bench outside, but not an option in the winter time. Most customers just grab and go. The falafel is also availalbe in a platter form so it's not as messy to eat.",-1
"The food was excellent and the all the backwaters and other members of the waitstaff were also excellent. Â The ambience was nice, upscale, casual, without feeling uptight at all. Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be going back.",-1
"The falafel were superb, stuffed grape leaved were very delicious, mixed grills were excellent and very flavorful, and the kenafah was very good. The place was VERY noisy, we were screaming to hear each other and the kenafah was slightly salty, but these are minor things. The big picture, this was most authentic Lebanese food I've had in the US!",-1
"OMG...I must be either SUPER picky or the food really is not good. It was really cool to have a octopus cut up sashimi style and watch it still squirm...And then the SUPER HUMUNGOUS seafood hot pot with the live lobster, abalone and octopus...VERY novel. Â But that's where it went THUD. And I mean in Â HUGE way THUD!!!! Â  All the rest of the seafood was sooo old and tasteless. Â It was HORRIBLE. Â How everyone gives this place such high ratings I have no idea. Â Can you not taste that all the rest of the NON-MOVING seafood is already cooked, OLD and tasteless? Â It was super fishy. Â NO WAY I would go back to this place. Â I am actually angry. Â It was by far the worse meal of my life! Â  UGH!",-1
"For $10 I not only got the burrito, but also a cute small size bag of chips and two small containers of salsa.:)",-1
Not really feeling any spark in this relationship. Â Maybe gonna break up. Â Better food and energy easily found in the hood now.,-1
"Fagettaboutit! I love this pie. I tried the Sicilian first and then the regular. I loved them both but the Sicilian was my fav. The service was great and they accommodated 10 of us, 5 of whom where young children.",-1
"Started off a little rocky when they did not have our reservation. But quickly changed when they not only fit us in but amazed us with great service and interesting, delicious, amazing food. There were four of us so we did the ""chef selection"". Everything was the so good.",-1
"Staple canton restaurant in Chinatown. Does get ridiculously busy but traffic moves quickly. Floors are greasy, decors nothing to instagram about but damn the food is good here. One of, if not the best place to get Cha Siew (roast pork) from. I'll stake my life on it. Top 3 for Roast Pork in Chinatown (in no particular order) - Big Wong - Kim Tuong Restaurant (chrystie st) - Noodle Town (bowery) Service sucks a lot. But let me explain why. Chinatown food is so cheap (~5$ per rice dish) that for Restaurants to make money, they need a quick turn-over rate. They NEED you to be in and out as quick as possible. Its a trade off , cheap food for ""bad"" service. And in ""bad"" I mean, they'll get you tea, your order and your check. If you want someone to smile and whisper sweet nothings into your ears, find a classier joint. If you want good wholesome canton food, and can care less about the theatrics, come to Big Wong. Let me add how disappointed anyone who knows Chinatown food was when Anthony Bordaine featured Hop Kee in his show was. Hilariously ludicrous that he would choose Hop Kee over Big Wong for Cantonese Food. Hop Kee has altered their cooking for the tourist taste palette. No self-respecting cantonese person would eat there and consider it authentic caton food. Â Bordaine lost all credibility when he chose that over Big Wong.",-1
yeah. come here for sure!,-1
"One of my go to spots in soho. The seafood tower is fresh and can easily serve your hungry friends prior to a night out. For those of you still impressed with a famous face, yup still there, hi! Bread is delish be careful or you'll eat the tables portion!! Loud, tables close who cares it is NYC enjoy!!",-1
"Classic hand pulled noodles in beefy spicy sauce with a side of steamed dumplings equals a wonderful Saturday late brunch. Â Also love the tiny screaming woman who runs this place. Â She keeps a tight ship, but somehow is also reassuringly protective of her customers....",-1
Don't go here if you are gluten intolerant! The staff was very clear with us that they can not accommodate this need.,-1
"I love taking friends who are visiting the city to this spot. The area can be somewhat unsettling at night, but navigating the area is well worth it when you see the pleasant surprise on your friends' face as you take them down this small alleyway to stumble upon the quaint restaurant tucked away. It's also right across the street from a great beer garden called Loreley's that you can fall into afterward.",-1
"Constantly changing and evolving menu, good food, amazing beer, and cool staff. everything this neighborhood desperately needed in a bar. awesome!",-1
"Love this restaurant! Awesome place to go with family because the portions are huge - just the way I like it :) The wait can be kind of crazy even if you have reservations. Be prepared to eat and drink lots. The last time I went with a group of 15 we only ordered 4 dishes and there were still a good amount of left over food. Not a very intimate place to have dinner, it can be kind of loud and hectic depending on what nights you go.",-1
"True Thai bistrot at extremely affordable prices, and with a fabulous and cheap lunch menu. Good wines. Efficient and charming service. Unforgettable.",-1
"A beautiful bowl of pasta transported us to the cool loggias of Bologna. The first time I have had something that approached the flavors and sense of Emilia Romagna A choice of some cheeses for starters, a little prosecco, and then on to to a red from the Alto Adige. Wines a little pricey but excellent. Like going to Italy without the annoying flight. Ate across from the bar in front .Rear seemed a tad crowded and noisy but nonetheless FULL . Very popular so plan ahead.",-1
This place has one of the best falafels I've ever tried. The rest of the food is so hearty and healthy it is perfect when you are in the mood to eat vegan. The staff is very nice as well and we had many conversations with other customers that agreed with our opinions. I recommend this place,-1
"Beco is an unpretentious gem with a badass steak sandwich. Â Cool vibe inside. Â Nice waitstaff. Â  It is right next to McCarren Park, so makes a great stop for a beer or caiprinha after a game. Â My girlfriend had the shrimp stew and loved it. Â  We will be back!",-1
Good noodles.,-1
"After a visit from Guy Fieri, I had to check it out myself. Although the place itself is a total dive, the food is AMAZING. The hand pulled noodles really are tasty - soft and chewy in all the right ways. The dofu is really fresh. The roast duck was a little cold but still delicious. Ate until I was stuffed - and then some. Plus it is INCREDIBLY inexpensive.",-1
i love to get there hazelnut ice cream there. can't seem to find it anywhere else. i also get crepes there but it's nothing special.,-1
"One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. If you want sweet, look no further than the Vanilla Bean French Toast. Sublime. If you're feeling savory, one of the eggs Benedict variations - the Johnny (corn pancakes!) or the Lobster (lobster!) Their salads are also on point.",-1
"My favorite pizza in all of NYC. Â Dom is a true artisan. Â Waiting for good pizza is tough with a long lunch line which is all too familiar with anyone who has been to Di Fara. Â The best plan is to order early and get there early to get some awesome pizza. Â Whether it's square slice or round, i like them all. Â You just have to try it.",-1
"Although the rustic presentation seems a little rough at the outset, the warmth of the waitstaff and the food more than makes up for it within five minutes. The freshest ingredients appear to compose a perfect appetizer. The short ribs just melt off the bone. Each pasta is decidedly perfect. Wine paired with the meal is just perfect. Beside that--a parking spot right outside the door! Cant wait to return.",-1
"One of the best dates I have ever been on! Their Valentines day menu was amazing, and the wine pairing was great too. I love the decor, and the service is excellent. I would love to go back!",-1
"I had a wonderful meal here with a large group of friends last night. The appetizers; calamari Frito with a surprising touch of honey,and a rum glazed shrimp were a great start. The salmon was beautifully done and all of our portions were generous. Service was excellent and we will certainly return.",-1
aahaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of my fav place.... Love !!,-1
Walked past this places for weeks before venturing in with another couple... Was a little unsure at first because we were the first people for brunch but it soon filled up. the food was so good and was blown away by the vaca frita and the brunch special. Planning my next trip soon...,-1
I heard so much about this place that decided to check it out. It wasn't bad at all although my partner didn't enjoy it much. We had mussels for appetizer and it was my least favorite. I love pickles but then after having like more of them you really feel this acid and vinegar in your throat. My favorite was the corn soup. It was really yummy. The salmon ceviche wasn't bad either but I also wasn't wowed by it.,-1
I saw them making the squares and they layer paper thin slices of cheese on top of the dough before lading on a generous amount of sauce on top. Â This actually allows the dough to cook and become crusty throughout. Â The pie gets sprinkled with olive oil and a dusting of pecorino,-1
"Before I get into the restaurants problems, I'll say this: the burger is the best I've ever had, without question. Â I'm not usually a gourmet burger person, but this is the real deal. Otherwise though what an overpriced and dissapointing meal. Â The worst part was the wine - $70 for junk basically. Â If you want to be taken seriously as a restaurant, why is it so hard to have good wine at all price points? Â If I ever go back, which I doubt, I think I'd have to spend $100 to get something drinkable. Â Not fun.",-1
"4.5/5 for food, 5/5 for atmosphere, 5/5 for service Amazing restaurant. I loved almost everything about this place. I enjoyed its interior as well as its lively atmosphere. This restaurant is genuinely what you would call a ""fun"" eatery, and the food/wine was excellent as well. I will be coming back very soon and often!",-1
"I ADORE this gem out in the country (ya I said it) I have heard how amazing it is for the past couple months; and have finally enjoyed the food nirvana about 2 Fridays ago...better late than never! Â Since my first exposure to this amazing restaurant, I have been here 3 times. Â I can safely say that I am addicted to the Italian goodness! The crostini di avocado is a great way to start the dining adventure. Â The fresh avocado and olive oil complimented by the earthiness of provolone is a calculated and successful decision by the chef. Â I am always wanting more! Â Gnocchi al Brivido, Rigatoni Caprese, and the sea bass special are to die for. Â Again, the ingredients are very fresh and compliment each other very well. Â A party in my mouth! The wine list is extensive and offers various price points. Â I have not ordered a ""bad"" wine yet. The servers are always helpful and entertaining. Â I am usually laughing for the majority of my dining experience, and it is not always because of my friends. Â Many of the servers crack me up. The space is perfect for a romantic evening or a gal pal night out. Â I can sit by the front window and people watch or sit in the intimate, second dining room and relax, while enjoying my evening out. Will I be back here again?!? Â Heck, yeah!! Â Probably within the next month or two...",-1
"We chose to do the 4 course price fixe menu and it was wonderful. We walked out satisfied with the quantity of food, many times with price fixe menu we are not. The food was delicious especially the marrow bone with scallops, a very unique dish. The food is a blend of mainly Italian with Mediterranean influences. The service was impeccable. Decor was simple but elegant.",-1
"Momoun's will always have a special place in my heart. Â First ate there when I moved to NY back in the day and was going to NYU. Â Only have a couple of $$? Â No problem, Mamoun's would always satisfy. Flash forward to today and Momoun's still does it for me. Â Falafel's are as great and as cheap as ever, and the place looks exactly the same as it did 15 years ago, and probably exactly the same as it did in the 70s. Â  The hot sauce is insanely good too.",-1
"I assure you that I've tried pizza in many places and spaces and have to say that this is my absolute favorite. Between the sauce and crust, it's truly a magical experience. I prefer the white pizza, but I've tried their veggie concoctions and they are also quite good. That and the garlic knots are good to boot! You can't go wrong with this place (unless you just HAVE to sit down and eat your slice/s... then this place might not be for you.)",-1
"Lovely ambiance and delicious food! Reasonable prices too, cute spot with a ton of choices, everyone can find something on this menu they will like. Great wine too!!",-1
"As much as I enjoy the food here I dont see what all the fuss is about its a solid Italian restaurant thats all. I dont see waiting an hour for a table especially that there is no bar to wait at, anfd yes they have a wine bar big deal. The service gets a bit scirmish when its busy but there is no decor no ambiance, simply a good Italian joint",-1
"Small place that fills up quickly... But our waiter was super cute and sweet. We started off with the fresh plantains and guacamole which was wonderful, followed by an assortment of meat empanadas and then dessert empanadas as we sipped our happy hour margaritas. Small sizes, so order several of everything... but they're very affordable.",-1
"Two words: Dollar. Oysters. EVERYDAY (yes, sat and sun incl). From four til closing. Â CLOSING!! That's unheard of. Long gone are the days (weekdays, mind you) of rushing to a restaurant after work trying to catch the end of their oyster happy hour. Granted it does take some time for them to come out but their staff are all so sweet that I'm not even mad. Service has always been top notch. Yes, Barn Joo. You've made me one happy diner.",-1
"Huge fan of the truck, so when i heard they opened a restaurant I had to go check it out. First off, i should clarify that this isn't a really sit down and eat place ( they have a couple of tables, but no service) The place is small and 70% of it is devoted to the kitchen ( now I know where they make the taco truck goodness) Â  But in the end its about the food right? And the food is as good if not better than the truck. The spicy korean ""Gnocchi"" is great, perfect blend od sweet and spicy. The chicken fried taco ( which is often offered by the truck ) Â is good but not the usual home run from the truck. Didn't offer anything taste wise that you would want more of. Â  The burritos are always great especially me personal favorite the short rib. so do yourself a favor, if you can't make it to the truck, check out there permanent ( hopefully) location.",-1
"Bianca is an adorable, authentic Italian treasure!! Portions were large, prices were great, service was amazing!! We had a bottle of wine and a three course meal for two and our bill was $65! If you want a rustic, family style Italian meal; you must go to Bianca's!!!!!",-1
"What is there not to love about Buvette!! Â Great wine, wonderful appetizers, and if you're in the mood some lovely small dishes for dinner (note: this isn't a full on restaurant as I normally think of it; more small plates for a light dinner). Â The workers (and owner) are absolutely delightful - they must have been trained by someone at the four season - and always make my experience quite pleasant. Â  I'm happy that they've become so popular - they deserve to be successful, but that also means that I'll only show up now on odd nights when the crowds don't descend on the place. Â  PS - try breakfast... Â Really yummy!",-1
Awesome curry. They should bottle it.,-1
"Certainly it's not worth the hype, especially their burger, Primehouse, abc kitchen, wolfgangs even peter lugers with their terrible service are better options when it comes to burger. The place looks great though, and it has a good vibe during prime hours.",-1
"So I stumbled upon this place while trying to search for a good dinner spot in Williamsburg. Oysters-Above average, waitress made good recommendations Pork Chop-Good cut of meat, accompaying sauce was stellar! Overall, this restaurant did not disappoint! Will consider coming back if I end up in Williamsburg around dinner time.",-1
Classic French fare in a cozy setting. Great weekend brunch.,-1
"Pylos is a great authentic Greek restaurant in the city. Â The decor of the restaurant is charming and the ambiance sets the mood! Â The food was soo good. Â The phylo dough stuffed with the filling of your desire is great, my mouth waters just thinking about it. Â I loved the service, which was fast and efficient and very friendly. Â They were very accommodating. Â I am going to be returning with a couple of friends of mine next week, They will absolutely love their time here as did I. Â Pricey but definitely worth it.",-1
"Great lunch spot. Â If you don't know what you want to eat, you'll find something to your liking here.",-1
"...Not like the Juniors I remember in downtown Brooklyn. Â Great food and service, but way too packed. Â I felt like I was dining with the people at the tables on both sides of me as well as my date. Suggestion: Take out 30% of the tables and raise the prices by 30%.",-1
"OMG if you like fries and sauce then you are gonna be in absolute heaven! These french (or should I say pommes frites) were unlike any fry I have tasted and the variety of sauces were impressive and delicious. I ordered a regular that was $4.50 (LOTS of fries and easily splittable) and got the roasted garlic, cheddar, and parmesan peppercorn mayos on the side. All three were delicious and I also sampled (ask for samples because they are very generous) multiple more including their newest which is the black truffle mayo (amazing!). The sauces are $1 extra or you can get 3 for $2.50 but it's so worth the extra $$. Where else can you get such unique sauces? They also will give you lids so you can take them home to enhance other sub-par fries =) Which mayo is the best you may ask? Honestly, I think it depends what your in the mood for because they are all very unique and delicious. I will say that the three I got were very good but the other one I was close to getting was the smoked eggplant mayo which was VERY good. As for the fries, they were very big, thick, crunchy, hot, and were even good by themselves with just a bit of salt. Not your average fry by any means. All in all, if you haven't experienced true Belgium fries then you definitely need to hit this place up because it will change your whole french fry and sauce outlook.",-1
Meh. Â Atmosphere is nice but food is not as good. Â  I wanted to like it but maybe we'll try it again some other day.,-1
Food here is so amazing...I would love to go once again with my family. My dad loved the chicken dish... 4 stars..,-1
"Always great. Love the hand made pizzas, love their salads. Also a nice bar scene for those not interested in a pick up scene. Wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and will never steer you wrong.",-1
"I wish I could give 4.5 stars because I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5. Â  I had to try the place, just to see what all the fuss was about. Â The storefront was so cute (but the line to get in was not). Â After paying 20some dollars for 6 pieces, I had buyers remorse, which quickly vanished when I tasted the so so delicious Salted Caramel macaron. Â So fresh, gooey and nice flavor. Â But I had a big meal that day and left the rest for the next day or so. Â By day 2 and 3, they still had a good flavor, but tasted like the prepacked macarons at Financier. Â Buyers remorse returned. Â  All in all, I still think these are the best, I just shouldn't have bought more than I could eat right away. Â And I don't love the price, so I would be hesitant to recommend this store to a friend, unless of course they were a macaron fiend.",-1
"Good food, but bad customer service. Don't think I'll be back here very soon.",-1
"MMMM.....delicious pizza by the waterfront. Go here after crossing the brooklyn bridge. Delicious, affordable and iconic.",-1
Awesome fried Chicken at Buttermilk Channel. Â I may not be from the South but awesome fried chicken is just awesome. Â The coleslaw that came with the fried chicken was pretty good too. Â I especially love the pecan pie sunday. Â That along with the fried chicken is worth the wait and worth the extra visit.,-1
"Delicious topping (I got the clam pie) but quite expensive and when getting to the last pieces of pizza the base got super chewi and hard to bite off. But still, a beautiful taste.",-1
Food was pretty yumm service was great nice place to eat . The wait to get a table was a few minutes. Waiter was attentive and fast. Chicken plate was juicy.,-1
great food! it was worth the long wait,-1
"Les pizzas y sont fabuleuses. L'histoire de ce restaurant est assez particuliÃ¨re et drÃ´le (je vous laisse le soin de dÃ©couvrir). Une pizza large pour deux suffit amplement a vous rÃ©galer ! Je n'ai pas trouvÃ© le personnel trÃ¨s aimable le jour de ma visite, du moins rien de fantastique (la personne a l'accueil devait Ãªtre dans un mauvais jour).",-1
this is the best fast food i have ever eaten! you cant beat this!,-1
"I think this pizza is way over-rated, and I don't know how this 80 something year old man caters to all of his patrons. My friends and I ordered two pies and although the ingredients were fresh, the pizza itself was very soggy. We waited for an hour to receive our order and each one of us were thoroughly disappointed. Â I don't really recommend Di Fara - there are much better places that you can get an excellent pizza pie in Brooklyn. It was NOT terrible, but I don't ever wake up craving this pizza -I've definitely had better. Â Maybe the pizza was better tasting when the owner was in his prime?... or maybe we went there on a bad day? The best thing about this place was watching the owner make each pie, constructing each order with ingredients from his home-grown garden. Â Unfortunately, the end result did not taste that memorable. Â I really wanted to fall in love with this place, but just couldn't. I want to return back here Â in the near future because everyone deserves a second chance...",-1
"You'll likely have to plan in advance in order to get in, but it's worth it. Â Great service, fantastic quality of dishes ... Among the best Japanese restaurants in the city. Â The location ""looks"" peculiar from the street-level, but it just makes the eventual discovery that much more interesting, too :)",-1
"This great little restaurant is the real deal! Great pizza oven delicious food wine and desserts! Last night we had great pizza and then a sample of the sweets creme brÃ»lÃ©e, bread pudding and Nutella crepe. Yum! Fabulous go visit!",-1
Brunch was good/solid,-1
"I guess I forgot to review this place when I first came here and now I forgot my first time meatball shop experience. I know I came here at the beginning of their opening and I was with K. I can't remember what K ordered, but I know I got the Spicy Pork with the Spicy Meat Sauce. I didn't care too much for it, because it wasn't spicy at all. Not even a tingle or did it pack any sort of heat. I remember K wanted the Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich and I remember how much I hated it, because the cookie was ROCK SOLID. WTF! I much rather have Ice Cream with a softer and chewier cookie. TOTALLY NOT IMPRESSED! This place keeps getting so much press and so much love - it really makes me want to give this place another chance. So I came here with W, F and J - W loves this place, but meanwhile their not big foodies like me. F and J got the sliders. W got the salad and we all got the risotto - W and F loves the risotto. I am sorry, the taste was good, but I did get some uneven cooked risotto - not as bad as Risotteria, but still I hate risotto that are not cooked properly. This time I just got the Classic Beef with the plain tomato sauce - it tasted better than my first experience, but still this taste did not leave me wanting to wait here for 2 hours to eat these damn balls of theirs. It did not change my life enough where I would actually want to wait to eat here. What is the fascination of these balls that people are waiting to wait up to 2 hours to eat here? PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU ORDER, because I must be eating the wrong things. W had to get the Peanut Butter Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream - cookie wasn't brick, but semi-hard though. I think they just need a better cookie recipe. This place still hasn't win me over.",-1
"BARF... Literally. I rarely write bad reviews, however, I am so disappointed/grossed-out by this place.. And it confuses me why there is always a crowd there. This place obviously feeds off the crowd going into the bar, Von, next door and doesn't put in effort with their food, service or CLEANLINESS. The utensils had food crusts, cup had lipstick... Honestly, the level of hygiene was like an underground, illegal, chinese restaurant. Worst of all, they have no Restaurant Inspection Grade... I REPEAT, THEY DO NOT HAVE A LETTER GRADE... How is ths place surviving in NYC? The much better restaurant to go to is Lil' Frankie's on E. 1 St., Sorella on Allen, or.... Any place I can think of! P.S. I only gave it 1-star because I was forced too. Eek! Methinks not, for real.",-1
"If you're in new york for one day only, this is the place to have pizza. It's pretty much perfect. This is definitely and absolutely the place to go if you need a story to take back to your friends back in Parma.",-1
"Very spacious, beautifully appointed room. This is a large restaurant. Tables are well spaced, and so not noisy - what a lovely change. The table settings very upscale and nicely done. The dishes are presented on large white china flat bowls. The service was superb. 100% recommend this restaurant. Would be good for dinner too - as it is also in good proximity to Grand Central.",-1
"This is the best ramen place in NYC in my opinion. Wait times can sometimes be long but waiting by the bar up front isn't all that bad. I love sitting at the bar inside and watching the cooks work. If you can make it for lunch, it's well worth it. I recommend the pork buns and akamaru ramen! They also make their noodles there which you notice when you go to the bathroom. Only weird thing about that is that it's right by the bathrooms.",-1
Pho was good. However it was not better than sao Mai. Peking duck banh mi was a good idea but didn't taste that great to me. This place was a good place to try but I doubt I'll be coming back again.,-1
I'm not sure why this place has a 4-star average. Â Solid but nothing special.,-1
"Went to this place for dinner with high expectations because of the high rating on Yelp and the line of people I always see during the weekend, but I should have read through the reviews before! Seems like their brunch is a hit. Dinner was alright, but it's not like something exceptional I expected. The place was pretty big inside - it's actually amazed me because I've seen this place gets super packed over the weekend. I'll probably go give another shot on their brunch.",-1
"my friend and i went here for lunch and absolutely LOVED it! the atmosphere is fresh, modern, cool but not too cool for skool. my mojito was yummy and interesting, with a nice touch of grapefruit. my friend's ""bloody maria"" was spicy and gooood. we each had a salad, and each LOVED every bite! i don't recall which salad my friend had, as their menu changes daily, but my mackeral salad was beautifully presented and scrummmy! we also loved the thick, crusty wheat bread they give you, and their deviled egg+tuna appetizer {very satisfying}. :) look forward to coming back!",-1
dumplings check. Â Kimchi rice and steak double check!,-1
Fantastic restaurant. Great food. Â It's flavorful and affordable. Â Tasty wine. Good atmosphere and it feels like it has something for everyone.,-1
Great bahn mi (order the #8). Quick and friendly service. I eat here at least 3x per month. Love this place!,-1
"Nothing special, just ok pizza. Crust was pretty dry, wouldn't go back for sure. Your not missing anything",-1
"Consistence is the key to this restaurant's success. We have had the good fortune of enjoying many dining occasions at Gramercy Tavern. Most of our dinners have been the tasting menu. Be it the vegetarian or the meat we're always blown away by the freshness and presentation. The servers are absolutely fabulous and have in-depth knowledge of the ingredients and wine pairing association. There can be a pretentious air at times, and the menu really could be updated (The tasting still seems to be Collichio's brain child and he's been gone for a few years). Yet if we lost those consistent dishes and the slight whiff of snobbery it wouldn't be Gramercy would it?",-1
"I have a special place in my heart for peaches, i really do. I didnt want to trash the place before but as my auntie would say, ""you get what your hand calls for""."" With that said, Peaches is back on the come up. I like the additions made to the menu and it looks like you got rid of some of the 5hitty waitstaff. YAAAY! Someone even pulled the brick out of mgmts azz (im just saying lol). Overall, everyone seems to be more friendly around the joint these days.. Im also glad to see the new catering addition. Kudos Peaches, the moral of this story is -- We like you but dont get gassed I mean that in a big sister kinda way : )",-1
INSANELY GOOD. Everything from the beef to the sauce is absolutely delicious. I love Rao's so much.,-1
"Great lunch today, with barely a wait at all. The size and dining style (shared seating) reminded me very much of dining in Thailand, and the bowl of pork noodle soup (the special of the day) was as close as I've had in the states. Meals are served with chili and fish sauce condiment trays if you want it spicier, which I really appreciated. My Thai iced coffee was a drink and dessert in one. Too bad I ate alone- in my opinion Thai food is best enjoyed family style with lots of dishes to taste and I really wanted to try the papaya salad.",-1
2nd time here and was not disappointed. Never knew they had two levels. We ate downstairs and had drinks before. Bartender was great and drinks were authentic Cuban style. Food was filling even with a smaller portion. A little noisy but still has a good atmosphere.,-1
"this hard not to fall in love with this little gem of French cuisine in NY. The food is great and the place feels exactly right in every aspect. And that starts with the waitress who was wonderfully friendly, despite us showing up with only half the party we had made reservations for. The restaurant is tiny with the kitchen more or less part of the one room of the restaurant. Initially there was only one other couple in the restaurant (we arrived at 7) but then by eight it was completely full, which i guess is not too hard since it just has a bunch of tables. Despite the size though it was never really loud, it felt very much like having a dinner party at home. and so did the food. while certainly much better than at home it didn't come with the uppidy feeling of restaurant food, it arrived on plain plates, with little decoration on it, or visuals to make it look better on the plate. it was plain and simple. as a started we had the curry mussels (since the waitress was quite insistent that we didn't get the white wine mussels with our red wine) and it was certainly no mistake, the curry mussels were amazing, completely different from other mussel dishes. but the sauce was not too overwhelming to drain out the overall mussel taste. the other starter was the pate which also was really good. nice and chunky with a nice side of pickles. as the main course i had the skirt steak. and this was amazing. cooked quite french ... the medium was still quite bloody ... but the taste was just perfect. what made it so special was the sauce it was served with. the only way i can describe it is similar to the sauce you get escargots in. an olive oil/butter herb and garlic mix. and the mix of this sauce with the steak was a perfect combination. as a desert i had the dish that someone else before me already described, without remembering the name ... same here. i don't recall the name, but it was amazing. it felt like my grandmother made it. it was a soft meringue floating in a vanilla milk sauce with fresh caramel on top ... very good. while i agree that this is the perfectly romantic date restaurant, the food and service will make me come back here even if i am not on a date. it is just great food in a great environment.",-1
Off the hook. Flavorful. Great portions. Good atmosphere.,-1
"Dinner for four at Palma. Promptly seated and provided drinks in a hurry. For apps - calamari and shrimp. Very fresh and flavorful. Arugla salad with fennel, oranges and olives was nice, but nothing special. Entrees were out of site. Perfectly cooked lamb, well accompanied by rabe and potatoes. Swordfish and spinach ravioli were spot on. The star of the show was the fish stew. A thin, crusty dome of bread covered a large bowl of seafood, fresh herbs and an exquisite broth. When the server cuts the dome and folds it back, the scent that escapes burns itself into your memory. The taste makes you reconsider dinner plans forever.",-1
"very small so I would suggest a party of 2 (4 at most) and you could still wait a very long time. big brick oven. they roll pizza dough under candle light where all diners can see. BYOB. only serves pizza and calzones - try both (I would suggest the calzone with just garlic, it doesn't need much). great atmosphere, even better food and totally worth the wait. cash only.",-1
"Cozy lay out once you get past the bouncer, right behind a psychic shop which is pretty entertaining. Drinks are great and the people are friendly. I am not a fan of the west village but I am definitely a fan of this place",-1
"Exquisite cuisine, breakfast here is fabulous and so refined ! I really recommended.",-1
Was here for Sunday brunch. To say I was blown away is an understatement. While I waited for the eggs I was served incredible biscuits. But that was nothing compared to the eggs Duck eggs with foie gras were the most amazing omelet I ever had. It was a meal into itself with the foie gras and duck on the bone. Will be back for sure. Deserves all the stars it gets,-1
"So this place is unexpectedly modish. A welcome addition to the culinary revolution happening here in the South Stuy. Â I must say the owner's have a quixotic dichotomy of interior design. While the Â restaurant says sophisticatedly hip the backyard is clearly eclectic artist. (ok so that's cheeky, but true) Â You see this dichotomy rear it's head throughout the food parings with punny comical references thrown in almost randomly. Â  While I must say the concept is Mark Zuckerberg Â strong they need to carry the execution through each entree and course. Â As a result our total experience was for lack of a better word a ""mixed bag."" I will give them a 5 star on the ""Fish and Some Chips"" which was superbly presented and deliciously sensory. Â  The dish pretty much epitomizes their ""modish Marcel Duchamp"" style. It's hilariously excellent! Â With full length bass posised to take flight, yet carbonized in a deep fried golden crust! Yum! However, the beef tenderloin although tasty, and if you like dijion maybe excellent, it lacked the subtle punny undertones and unique presentation. Â  The Foie Gras doughnut on the other hand was uniquely on point. Â I think I remember the owner using the term ""It will haunt your dreams."" Â I couldn't agree more, I want another... Â  Finally, the dessert menu. Â I just don't understand it, snickers bars? just straight up? with wrapper? Although, I Â appreciate the idea of the ready-made, I would encouraged a little more creative capital out of the dessert montage. For instance a snicker bar in a dark chocolate molten lava cake, would be interesting. You can fasten the snickers bar completely vertically for obvious references and put some whipped cream on top! Â (ok so that's cheeky too, but that's the whole point!) Â A snickers bar in wrapper leaves the guest wondering, ""why don't I just go to the bodega?"" Â  Â  Â The worms and dirt was a cool concept but confusingly executed. Â  I think a little more tweaking and refinement and this menu could be one of the hottest in BK as the owners clearly have the creative prowess and cooking expressionism. Â Currently they lack a little focus. Â  Â Re-attention needs application to all and not just a few. Â See the concept through and this uncovered gem could pierce strong in NYC's culinary fabric. Â After all, you're only as good as your weakest composition.",-1
Great place to eat. I loved this place. The food was amazing and the scenery was very impressive.,-1
It kicked bobby flays ass and its atop of premier asian food a must go,-1
Great place for brunch. Service and food were really good. I want to go back for dinner.,-1
"Totally agree with Alan t. This place has really no sense, it was messy and not organized The only good thing is beer over there but its very expensive, the food was really awful, over salted, the atmosphere was so so, but it was busy, very loud. Service was inattentive and the manager didn't help and was rude to us. I won't go back to this place.",-1
"Fresh, healthy food is the first thing that comes to mind when writing a review for Mulberry & Vine. I typically have the same thing every time I go in: Korean Beef, Sesame Noodles and Kale Salad. The beef comes with onions and it's delicious and melts in the mouth. The venue is quite large, is very clean and has a high ceiling with seating upstairs. The staff are really friendly and the service is great. I highly recommend this place",-1
Tasty lobster rolls but the portions could be a little bigger for $15. Well worth if it if you're in the mood for lobster.,-1
"SO good. So so good. Â I was there almost a month ago and I still think about the meal I had here. Â Dumplings were great, red snapper mind-blowing, wine was delicious, cocktails were fine (but the food was so good I couldn't have cared less). Â I honestly can't wait to come back.....so much so I've proposed The Good Fork for date night for the past 3 weeks.",-1
"Do NOT get the curry chicken salad! It's basically mayo, chicken, and lettuce. My boyfriend (who eats everything) couldn't even eat it because he felt it was sooo heavy (and he easily eats two cheeseburgers with large fries) and just bad tasting. When we told the waitress she said there was nothing that she could do except for tell us to write what we think online.... The atmosphere of the place is nice and warm though. Â If we had ordered something else, maybe our experience would have been better -- our friends, who told us about it, love it so it must be good for some dishes.",-1
"Tasty, fresh food. A blend of latino and Carribean foods. Â On one had it feels like home, and on the other, it's new flavors are just right to be considered cuisine. Â  I had the grilled fish with sweet plantain (cooked in the peel). Â It was tasty, perfectly seasoned, not overwhelming. My wife had the fried chicken. Â Very good as well., most and delicious. Only complaint would be the yucca fries (cassava). Â I'd skip them. Â  Go and enjoy.",-1
"This is an excellent restaurant that deserves more attention than it's gotten. The food is arguably the freshest and Â best tasting Thai I've had, but its not your typical local Thai place. Everything is ""elevated"" in the sense that the ingredients taste fresher and the food is much more refined than other Thai places. Recommended dishes: papaya pad thai, duck with lychees, & Thai burger Note about the burger: if's definitely a winner but the fries (oh the fries) steal the show!",-1
"Although he isn't strictly gluten-free, my husband avoids wheat and dairy, which makes the typical Italian restaurant challenging, to say the least. Looking for a place for dinner near the Cutting Room, I noticed that Bistango has plentiful gluten-free options, so we made a reservation through Open Table, since the website said reservations are recommended. It's not just an alternate pasta choice -- all the filled pastas like ravioli and tortellini are also GF. We really enjoyed our meal, every dish was delicious, from appetizers through dessert. Service was attentive and the decor is attractive, and although the space is pretty tightly packed, it wasn't noisy. We had grilled artichokes and a side of butternut squash for appetizers, dairy-free, GF ravioli with spicy marinara and tortellini with sweet potato and butternut squash, and sorbets and flourless chocolate cake for dessert. It was all very good.",-1
"The outdoor room in the back is a hidden gem. Â Good date spot, food was extremely tasty, my favorite was their salmon tapas. Â The menu has quail & octupus on it if you're feeling adventurous. Â Small servings and pricey but overall, I'm a fan.",-1
"I really wanted to LOVE this place. The pizza was good, not great for the price. The pies are relatively small so they aren't great for sharing. I had the pizza with the jalapenos and fried egg.. can't quite remember the name? It was good, but like I said we were assuming we could share and just didn't get filled up. Still being hungry we ordered the tirimasu and it was AMAZING. So moist and perfect about of espresso flavor. Don't know if I'd go back, considering the wait was close to an hour, but Â most likely will get some to go in the future.",-1
Awsome pork butt ssam. Never tried it like that before Â  David Chang is amaizing!!!,-1
"I got married at The Counting Room two weeks ago. Â We have been patrons of the bar since it opened for its great cocktails, nice music and open airy feeling. Â It is a great place to meet friends for a quiet drink or party downstairs later in the night. Â The drinks are always interesting and the bartenders know their stuff. Â When we decided to get married in the neighborhood we looked into every option (on a budget) and finally ended up there and are so glad we did. Â We had the ceremony, reception and very late night dance party all in the space. Â Ruth and the rest of the staff were awesome, our guests raved about the drinks and they were so accomodating and helpful the whole way through the planning process and actual wedding day. Â The space is gorgeous as is and all we brought were flowers and it was beautiful. Â It has a good sound system, projector, DJ booth and plenty of restrooms, etc. Â plus two floors and two bars. Â We had the dinner catered by Sips and Bites on N. 10th since The Counting Room does not have a full kitchen and it worked great (see separate review). Â I recommend The Counting Room for any kind of private event (I think there was a baby shower earlier that day). Â  Our party went until 4:00am and the staff stuck it through the whole night! Â It was just perfect.",-1
"Yeah, they did not miss. Went here last night with my girlfriend and we each got a 5-course tasting dinner. Â The waitress helped us out and offered us separate menus so we could try more plates. There was ham and potato croquettes; monk fish liver pate; sweetbreads; winter salad with mushrooms, ricotta, and a quail egg; trio of rabbit; black bass; ribeye; squab with ""arroz brut""; cheese; and dessert. It was all delicious, some dishes more than others, but nothing missed the mark. Â  My only regret is not having a larger appetite.",-1
"This has got to be one of the best BBQ joints in Brooklyn. Â Everytime I go to Fette Sau, I order 1/4 lb of everything to split with 2 other people. Â The sides there are also very good.. Â The best time to go to Fette Sau is early during the evening because that's when they first serve the food. Â All the meat there is juicy and flavorful. Â I guarantee it will be a great experience if you don't mind the wait. Â The line can be hectic on the weekends.",-1
"I'll start by saying that I like this place and that I'm sorry that I can't give it the excellent rating. The menu is small and seasonal and yet they seem to run out of things - regularly and this can be quite frustrating. Add to that service is a little spotty - OK, more than a little, and it loses that fifth star. On the flip side, the menu and food are very good and not unreasonably priced. They have a nice, albeit somewhat crowded, back yard and the interior is fairly typical nouveau-Brooklyn and nicely done.",-1
"Cheap and delicious. Anyone who knocks this place is stupid. Are you kidding me. You don't get 10 star restaurant for 5 bucks. You go there and get some good snacks, and they use pretty fresh ingredients. People pay the same amount for halal street food. Gotta give vanessa some love. BTW does the real vanessa work here? Anyway. I think people like this place, and I am one of them",-1
"Just awesome! Tiny place, but the soup was amazing!",-1
"For some reason, this location is more meaningful to me. so everytime I decide to visit, this would be my location of choice and the parking around here is great. Beer selection is always great as they have some of my favorite belgium beer on tap and a ton of tripist and other speciality in bottles. As for the mussle, they are always good and you cant really go wrong. If its nice out, come early and grab a table outside. Indulge!",-1
"Great dinner! We had the carpaccio, Brussels sprouts, short rib special, and the salami pasta. All were pretty good. The carpaccio was topped with tiny crunchy bread crumbs and little red onions which only enhance the dish. Both mains were pretty good. The sommelier was good but not smiley lol. It mattered to me not most people I'm sure. The table was not intimate and the place was loud. A cool place but not a quiet romantic place. I would still highly recommend it!",-1
Fried Chicken!!!,-1
"Charming place for a casual, civilized, yet special lunch. Came on a weekday so no wait (despite the no reservation policy). Service is knowledgeable w/o being overbearing. Menu is focused and inventively classic French. A nice afternoon lunch refuge.",-1
"Reservation highly recommended. Went early without recommendation, was able to get seating before the local crowd arrived. Kids had eggs, garlic home fries, and crispy bacon strips. The irregular cut fries are crispy and a must have. Adults ordered the scampi and grits and Uovo al forno. The scampi and grits with poached eggs are flavorful and superb; and the eggs and baked casserole beans are excellent as well. Best fresh squeezed orange juices I have had in a long time.",-1
Great food and even better service,-1
"This place rocks! Great for groups, awesome food at a great value. The best part about The Boil is the music...only throwback R&B",-1
"My new favorite brunch spot. So impressed with everything about this place. Love the patio, the service and the Moroccan touches to the brunch menu. I don't mind waiting to get a seat at Mogador. I love the hummus here - creamy and flavorsome which makes me wish they package it up and sell at Foodtown or Tops! Love their chicken tagine too - it's a little cheaper at lunch and definitely worth trying. It's slowly stewed and just as good as the tagines you'll find in Marrakesh.",-1
not the greatest pizza but their pricing is great. Pizza is pizza so idc as long as I can get a slice idc so much. A lot of tourists come here so its a little annoying but other than that not too bad,-1
I love this place so much! Everyone here should get a really big raise! Super friendly and everyone is really cute! Food is amazing and i always try to get their specials! Great chef and management! Mirrors are nice to! Their french fry sauce is so great and i love bread b4 my meal a+ mr odeon!,-1
"I love ramen. I have a favorite place I go to back in Los Angeles that is my barometer to every other ramen restaurant I come across. No more. Ippudo sets the standard. You walk in, and the decor is modern beautifully mixed with old world Japanese elements. Monday through Thursday they have 2 for 1 sapporo's, which is great. ANYWAY - so you walk in, and all the sudden the hostess says something in Japanese, and everyone greets you, including the kitchen, it's awesome. Service - the moment you take a sip out of your water, someone is there to refill it. I've never waited longer than 5 seconds for a server to come and get the bill from me. Food - ACAMURAMODERN and the PORKBUNS. You have to do it. Get fresh garlic and ask for the noodles to be cooked hard. From the moment that broth hits your mouth I swear you'll be in heaven. You might even shed a single tear when you finish your bowl of soup. The pork buns...I can't describe. Just do it. Trust me. This place is great. Like many other places in New York, you need to get there early. They do not take reservations. The restaurant opens up at 5pm and honestly at 5:30, it's usually packed by then with more than an hour wait, so really try to get there early. It's worth it. Ok seriously stop reading this review and go now wtf.",-1
"The atmosphere is cool. It is decorated very trendily and kitschy. An excellent happy hour menu and my pear hibiscus margarita were amazing. The music, the ambiance, the food, great service, great manager.....everything! !! The waiter is fast. Overall a great spot for Mexican food and will definitely be coming back.",-1
"Tiny, very popular. Crazed, rushed servers....but everything works out in the end. We ordered many of the small dishes. Several were outstanding. Several were good. 1 was just average. Definitely want to go back. Soon.",-1
"Couldn't possible think of a better place to come late at night to get a good satisfying noodle-starch overload, Â Pork and duck are delicious, and I love just ordering random things from the menu to see what comes out. Â The atmosphere isn't much unless you come in expecting a brightly lit not over-designed place, in which case the atmosphere is great.",-1
"Five Leaves is amazing! Beautiful people in a beautiful space and excellent food. What more could you ask for? The lamb scramble at brunch is awesome, and the burger is killer. The truffle fries alone keep me coming back. So does the house-made ricotta. Very scene-y, but worth the wait. Great people watching. The care they took with the design is evident in everything from the record plaer on the bar to the flowers on the table. Overall a very, very cool spot.",-1
"cheap, tasty and very filling. perfect combination for a broke ass new yorker. the only thing i hate is the watered down sriracha. but every ny apartment has a bottle of this stuff so its not too bad if you order it to go.",-1
"Everyone has gone into lengthy specifics, so just adding my thanks for a delicious tasting experience with tasting menu. Service was efficient, although I had a hard time understanding the server as he was describing each dish (heavy accent). Â Other negatives: Â they don't offer decaf coffee. Â And the regular coffee that is served came in an espresso cup, not a full size coffee cup. Â The 7-courses didn't fill us up so we had to order two more dishes - the foie gras and the octopus, both cooked well. I would come again for special events, not for a simple night in town nor when I'm starving!",-1
"Went tuesday and not only did I have some of the best Southern food this North of the Dixie LIne, but we were treated to live music.. Oh the chicken! Â had not been a fan until now.. will be back for sure.",-1
"I love the Boil! Delicious food, friendly service and a chill crowd. Very West Coasty and a must for people who love their shellfish as much as I do. Be prepared to get your hands dirty though and don't make any plans for after since you will be sure to want to waddle home and wash all the fish off. We had the soft shell crab to start which was just okay, then we shared bags of the Lobster, Shrimp, Crawfish and Dungeness Crab. The shrimp was my absolute favorite (suck the head!) but everything was delicious in that buttery garlicky old bay sauce. The corn and potatoes were also super flavourful in that sauce and the only thing I wished was that there was more of it. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get and I will definitely be back!",-1
Quaint little restaurant with delicious guacamole and empanadas. Viagra empanadas a must have. They are filled with seafood. The dessert empanadas with guava and cheese are amazing. I liked the fact the the spinach empanadas were baked not fried.,-1
Love the Po Boy and Pimms Cup. Â I'll be back.,-1
This is an evil cart. Â The food is so damn good and inexpensive. Â I'll wait the 15 minutes on line in the freezing cold for these guys.,-1
"I'm a big fan of french fries. It probably accounts for a too large part of my diet, but this is why I consider myself genuinely capable and adept for critiquing fries. Pomme Frites is a haven for the bored and hungry NYC metro college student in need of something quick, and of course good! Yes, the line can be a bit much. This is especially the case late at night on weekends because of the many NYU students and hipsters in need of satisfying their drunchies. But here's the thing (and keep in mind I'm not one for hype) the fries are well worth the wait. Also it's nice to stop by during the day with a friend or two and grab a spot at one of the two wooden booths at Pomme Frites for some chat and fries time. Did I mention how adorable the cones are and also the wide array of unique sauces to be tried? It's a must to check this place out, for sure.",-1
I have bees here for chance. I was directed to Pizza Roma my fav spot for pizza on Bleecker but my gf didn't want pizza so we walk on jones street and we try...it was so good and the staff so friendly!,-1
Pretty good burger. Not as good as some other options in the city. So 3 stars for not quite living up to the hype. It was fine. Except all the Goldman Sachs types cause unnecessary lines.,-1
"Lovely waiters, very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the meals and drinks. Everything I tasted here was exquisite. The home-made ravioli was on another level! Great wine choices, beautiful food and lovely, Italian vibe.",-1
When a friend invited me for lobster in Greenpoint I was hesitant. Â Wasn't there an oil spill like a decade ago? But after having brunch I would love to go back again. Â $19 for huevos ranchero with a heap of lobster on top plus a bloody mary with a giant lobster claw floating in the glass. Â I'm lobstered out for the next two months... And only $19! I feel like something is wrong but everything is so right.,-1
Wonderful place! very tasteful and decadent. So delicious. Good japanese food.,-1
"Authentic Hong Kong style cooking. Â The food is very tasty and unlike other Cantonese restaurants, is not greasy. Â The flat rice noodles with beef (gon chau ngau ho) is excellent as is their pan fried pork dumplings. Â Service is also very good.",-1
"This place rocks. The food is delicious, they put a big emphasis on sustainability and local, and the owner is a really sweet guy with a big heart. The lengua y papas with a pepita sauce was rich and delicious--the lengua practically melted and the potatoes were perfectly browned and soaked in sauce. Â A layer of bitter greens kept the dish from being too heavy. Â A well thought-out and nicely executed meal. Â The poached eggs with greens and toast arrived on our table, only to be covered in a hot, thin apricot-chile sauce. Â The flavor of the sauce was hard to describe: fruity, a little astringency from the chiles, and an undertone of spices. Overall, the place is very focused on farm fresh ingredients. Â The farm house look is definitely present. Â They have a decent selection of wines and some beers. Â Service was very friendly and efficient. Â Looking forward to many returns to this local spot.",-1
"Do yourself a favor and JUST GO. The food is just incredible. I loved every single bite of everything I had, as did my dinner mates. Service was friendly and efficient and everyone there really goes out of their way to make your experience pleasant. Our server was just wonderful and when I had a hard time deciding between two desserts, he surprised me by bringing me both. Of course, both were fabulous!",-1
"very nice, small but cozy. and the food was good",-1
"Pretty solid place. I came here and got the burger, which was pretty decent. The service wasn't that great, although all my friends have gone and never said anything bad about the service. I like that the entire atmosphere is super relaxed, and that all the food I and my friend got was decent. The prices were just a touch high and, again, I didn't feel like the service was all that great.",-1
"Cafe Ollin, also called Restaurant San Cristobal, offers authentic and homely Mexican food in the heart of Spanish Harlem. I have been there a dozen times and always enjoyed the fresh food. All their dishes are made-to-order so can be a wait once you place your order. Use the time to munch on your nachos and spicy red and green salsa. Dishes I especially enjoy are the Chicken Adobo, Chicken Mole, Vegetable Tacos, Cemitas and Tres Leches cake.",-1
"Their falafel are such a delight! Kosher, fresh, tasty, flavorful , fast and super affordable ! It is a place that I stop by each time I can ! I recommend Taim to anyone visiting NYC!!!!",-1
"Like the outdoor seating... food was very good, great place for brunch & close to the Museum of Natural History",-1
This place was in so many guides we had to try it. They were right. As close to a Parisien bistrot that you will find. Started with the onion soup which was spectacular. Practically a meal in itself. The bread was amazing. I had the duck confit which was excellent and my wife had the trout salade which was equally good. No room for dessert unfortunately. Definitely a keeper.,-1
"What great luck coming across this Italian restaurant prior to a show. My friend and I both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had salmon and she had fettucine alfredo. The service was great; the majority of patrons appeared to be regulars as many received hugs and kisses from the host and/or bartender. They offer both inside and outside dining and have an extensive menu. Their tiramisu (made there) was wonderful, obviously freshly made and with exceptional ingredients. Would not hesitate to visit again.",-1
This place has perfected the Eggs Benedict!!! This is a cute place coffee lacks a little but the mimosa's make up for it.,-1
"keep it simple is the name of a good burger.It would get five stars except for the Bathrooms need a facelift and the servers need a class in how to polite and say thank you ! Besides that the burger is juicy ,perfect size probably 7/8 ounces on a regular bun with regular cheese but i just ozzes flavour.. Bartender Jeff is great always has cool music on ...",-1
"Although the food was nothing over and above what I expected, the ambiance was fun! We got in just at the right time, waiting only 5 mins for a table. shortly after sat down the pre-theatre dinner rush let in. excellent service, great prices, and wonderful menu selection.",-1
"We had dinner at Verde a few months ago and decided it was the best restaurant ever! The food was over the top great and he service...great. Just a few days ago, we made a special trip to have breakfast (after reading about the pastry chef there). The coffee was top notch and breakfast was to die for. I had the fresh ricotta and walnut toast and my partner had the organic granola and yogurt with berries. Just so good! and the pastry bar was very enticing. We will definitely return for dinner or breakfast.",-1
"It's expensive and the wait can be long, but my god if they don't make the best damned ramen in the city. Combine their Akamaru Modern with the Kaedama Brooklyn ale for an amazing dinner. And don't forget the hiratsu buns. You will not regret them.",-1
"This place was good for lunch but it was really loud. Â We got a seat right away but if I had to wait a while I don't think I'd stay. Â The food was good but not amazing. Â Green Shashuska- underwhelming. Â Haloumi- small but delicious! Â Duck bacon- tasty. Â I think it'd come back if others wanted to go, but I wouldn't necessarily seek it out on my own, unless I peeked in and it was quiet. Â Then I think I could try the tuna salad that everyone is raving about and maybe chill out for a nice lunch.",-1
"After hearing about how amazing eataly is, we decided to make the journey and give it a shot... The shopping section is amazing! Very gourmet yet reasonable in options and pricing.. Â We had pasta calamari and a margarita pizza... The pasta was horrible. It tasted re-cooked, the shrimp was so over done you could barely cut into it and the sauce tasted like tomato purÃ©e. In other words, not the spicy zesty sauce the server raved of. The pizza was standard - with no awesome takeaways or remarks.",-1
"Beef Rendang, Canai Roti was great!",-1
Too greasy for my liking!,-1
Great atmosphere and good food.,-1
i love this place..! the decor is so nice and the food is soo yummi! is definitely me and my boyfriends favorite place:) .. Â  we ordered Â the sesame tofu also the tuna tartar and the spicy noodles... Â and everything was amazing!---- Â the avocado rolls Â werent Â that good .. but ill come back for sure very soon!!!!!!,-1
iam a great fan of this tasty pizza.,-1
"AmÃ©lie this place like it has the plague. I hated it. Its full of teen bopper gays, the night I went they were having a christina agulaira, justin, britney contest. the guys were awful, the booze sucked, the music was for crap, cramped outside...i even saw bobby trendy from the anna nicole show there. Don't bother.",-1
The wait takes away a star otherwise would be 4 the pizza is a little over rated but still worth going to at least once the service could be better we really never got asked if everything was ok just a pizza place so I guess no special attention is really needed,-1
Very good bar in Williamsburgh. Â Stumbled upon it and I am now a fan.,-1
The food here is Amazing. I had the chicken and rice platter and boy did it taste good. After my meal I even talked to the owner and complimented his restaurant. He was very courteous and even offered me a free desert but I declined ( i am on a diet) . Â I am definitely recommending this place to my friends.,-1
"Vegetarian Meatballs with parmesan cream sauce over spaghetti-- I dream about you, my dear sweet friend.",-1
"Being new to yelp and thanks to my recent Samurai Mama obsession I decided I'd give this place a chance. Â Almost didn't stay when they said it was going to be 45 minute wait, so glad I did. Â Probably some of the best pork buns I've ever had, and I've had a lot. Then we had the ramen. To me ramen is all about the broth and again, great. Perfect flavoring and consistency. The wait staff was super attentive even tho they were slammed. Bringing my boyfriend back next week!",-1
"After the gym every weekend, i like to reverse all the good i do by coming here. Â The staff is super friendly, and the food and drinks are amazing. Â here's a little run down of the food and drinks they offer: Sweet afton burger: Â lafrieda beef that is tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Â along with that fried egg, it's perfect! Â i find that it's delicious with gruyere, but my friend had it with provolone, and that was delicious as well. organic scrambled eggs: Â fluffy and delicious on it's own, or ask for it ""loaded"" where they toss some cheddar, irish bacon, and scallions! Â it's served with a few pieces of fluffy irish toast, and a grilled tomato. Â  grilled cheese: Â delicious grilled cheese, of course, I've had it with gruyere (my cheese of choice) Â - Â when you take a bite, you can see the cheese oozing out. Â it's served with McClure's pickle chips, and whole grain mustard. Â makes you feel like a child, the sophisticated kind;) fried MCCLURE'S PICKLES - fluffy dough deep fried with a nice thick piece of pickle inside. Â my only warning is BE CAREFUL. it's super steamy and hot inside! Â it's delicious especially if you're the kind that spend all afternoon there and need a little pick me u to soak up the liquor.. not that *i'm* guilty of that..... DRINKS: beer: i dont drink beer.... next! spicy cherry margarita: Â delicious, with real chunks of pureed cherries make this drink very satisfying and fun. Â lately though, the tequila has been infused either longer or with stronger chilis, because it's super spicy. Â not for the faint of heart! burn's daiquiri: Â delicious fruity drink - i had only one of these ever - its sweet and strong, but sometimes you just want something with an edge! elderflower: Â very delicious, you can really taste the cucumber and elderflower liquor, YUM! Â  witte screwdriver: unlike most screwdrivers that come out a bit flat, this one is MY FAVORITE DRINK on the menu. it's light, delicious but not overwhelming, and because it's made with the ommegang witte beer, it's slightly bubbly. Â which in turns makes me VERY bubbly afterwards:-D blueberry muddle: delicious and talk about bluberries! Â this drink is packed with perfumey blueberries, definitely a drink that everyone should try. Â unless you dont like blueberries... and if thats the case, whats wrong with you?!?! last but not least, 2 words: PICKLEBACK SHOT. Â shot of whiskey, and a shot of spicy mcclure's picklejuice. Â if you've never had this, and might possibly be cringing right now - Â do me a favor, try it ONCE! its delicious! hope everyone gets a chance to check this place out, i visited on a whim, and it's now my favorite bar in all of queens!",-1
"The staff here is so friendly - the hostess, bartenders, servers - all of them! Â  You can see their camaraderie and knack for hospitality shine through in the way they treat both the patrons and each other. Â  The food, every single item, was incredible. I have to recommend the mussels and clams linguini because I devoured them both. The oysters and uni totally worth the wait. Will be back soon.",-1
"Found this place on a top ten list of best BBQ places in America so I decided to judge for myself. This place was like a local hipster, urban neighborhood joint. Overall, I was not disappointed. The sausage and brisket were delicious. The sides were just..okay. AWESOME whiskey selection. I'll be back!",-1
"This place rocks. It's like eating in your mom's kitchen without actually having to go home. The mac n cheese is some of the best in town, with fontina and cheddar to round out the flavor. And breakfast is served every day, complete with mismatched coffee mugs that make it feel even more like home. Service is friendly and attentive, without being overbearing and you can easily walk out of Penelope for under $15",-1
I've only ever eaten at the bar but it's always been good. Every time we go we see this other patron who eats there 3-4 times a week and is also a been a chef. He is always saying to try the chicken. I would but the fish specials always seem more tempting. Definitely worth a stop but keep in mind this place is not super casual so dress like you should. It's worth it.,-1
"Bistango is a casual trattoria that hits all the right notes. The staff is welcoming. The decor is clean and uncluttered. The food is exceptional. I had lasagna - it was covered in gooey and chewy mozzarella and a meaty Bolognese sauce that was out of this world. Dining companion had capellini with shrimp and spinach, and she did not leave any on her plate. Other dining companion, who has gluten intollerance pigged out on pasta with Bolognese sauce - most of menu can be prepared gluten-free. Prices are more than reasonable. This is a place you want to return to again and again.",-1
"really really long wait, but excellent food. Â Pork buns were amazing.",-1
"I just moved to the area so I keep finding little things that really warms me up to my new home. Dekalb is certainly of those places a hidden gem. My friend and I were looking for places that would accommodate her special diet. Saw a sign for warm soup. From the outside look like all the other apartments near it just with a garage door not to far from the door making a slight difference. Well I'm glad they had that little sign up. We went in to find a warm place with warm colors of wood and the smell of fresh coffee just brewed greeting us with friendly people at the bar drinking from their coffee cups. A beautiful deity amazon woman with big hair greeted us and gracefully took us to a deeper area. A room completely made of windows ambient lightning and soulful music playing. I sat down on a church pew really feeling the sacredness of this place. We looked at the menu to find things that my friend could eat. I got the endive and she got the braised salsify to start. Then I got a almond stuffed trout and my friend got a vegetable burger. Followed by the parsnip yogurt dessert. The endive was savory and refreshing. I tasted the braised salsify assuming it would be salty but was happy to find a subtle sweetness. The almond trout was big enough for two people to eat but bc of this snow my appetite was large enough. The veggie burger she enjoyed saying she would come back for it again. The dessert was a masterpiece with the pyramid shape topped with a glass like caramel, a rare taste that wasn't overly sweet but just right. Got the check totaling $66 before the tip this had me and my friend nodding at each other yes we found our church of food. Usually food like this is easily $120-$160.",-1
"This place is crazy. Â I came here with someone and the line was out the door. Â I went to put my name down on the list and found out the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. Â Instead of leaving and coming back, we decided to wait. When my name was called, about an hour later, we were seated at a small table in the back. Â The restaurant is really small. Â There's a bar and a fair amount of tables, but everything is really crammed in. I ordered the miso ramen with an extra helping and an order of spicy bamboo shoots. Â When you mix the spicy bamboo shoots with the miso ramen it tastes pretty good. The service was OK. Â The waiters were attentive and our waters were always filled.",-1
"Buttermilk gets three stars. Full disclosure, I have only visited for brunch on the weekends, so take this review in that limited context. They have a decent bloody mary. The mimosa is passable. But...I can't get excited about the food offering. The first time I went I thought for sure I could get something amazing and unique, like maybe biscuits and gravy given the name. Instead was offered a menu with very limited selection of standard brunch fare. Nothing to make the experience special. Would I go again...maybe...but only if the company dictated the location.",-1
"After all the build-up, I had high expectations of Buttermilk Channel. Â Overall, I thought it was well worth the trip. Â I was afraid there would be a wait... but no wait for two on a Thursday night (the dining room actually feels quite large, not expected from the street). Â  The atmosphere is simple but very charming - definitely a place that draws you in! Â  We started with popovers (courtesy of the house) which were lightly dipped in a salted syrup - very good! Â Then we had oysters which were pretty fresh. Â For dinner, I just ordered a burger (yes - not very exciting but I had a hankering). Â It was made as ordered (med rare), juicy and plenty filling. Â The side of fries were a little too salty (and this is coming from someone who likes salt) yet we still finished them! Â  My friend had the trout and he said it was good. Â  It's a nice place to bring a date, parents, friends, etc and sit for a while and relax. Â Will definitely go back!",-1
"good Italian restaurant, medium size place",-1
"Places like Ollin Cafe is why I love NYC....I happen to be in the neighborhod and having missed breakfast, I had quiet the appetite. Purely on instinct, I saw this place, liked the outside, did a quick phone search for reviews and yep.....a winner!",-1
"Wow - they have so many reviews and they deserve it! This is my go-to for great Japanese food in NYC. Stellar food presentations, great service, amazing saki selection!",-1
I really wanted to like this place. Â I have NO IDEA how this place got one star Michelin. I have been here 4 times and each time only verifies what I feel is ok food with nice atmosphere.,-1
"I found Little Owl on a list of the best burgers in NYC. Their menu was appealing so I made a reservation- and thank goodness I did. Even though it was a Friday afternoon during a tropical storm, I don't think we could have gotten a table without the reservation. The space is small- cozy, warm, inviting. The food was nothing short of spectacular. We split the spring onion soup, which was warm and rich and a little bit spicy. Perfect for a cold, rainy day. I was so impressed with the bacon cheeseburger- it was juicy but not greasy, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. Even the fries were delicious. My companion tried the lobster risotto and would have licked the plate clean if we had not been in public. We were both completely full and I wasn't even able to finish my burger, which was tragic. I thought the prices were typical of what you would pay for a good quality meal in the city. Definitely more expensive than other choices, but it was worth every penny paid.",-1
"The food was good! Â My party ordered the steamed pork buns, seafood soup noodle, and wonton noodle soup. Â While the seafood soup noodle is one of the pricier soup noodles, it came with LOTS of fresh seafood, so it was worth it.",-1
"Super cute, fun place to come for BBQ. Nice atmosphere with picnic tables and non-hipster attitude. Will be back.",-1
"I joined three friends at Alta on a Friday night for girls night out. Â The restaurant is unassuming from the outside and blends in with the neighboring brownstones. Â However, as you go downstairs through the lower level entrance you enter a warm and inviting environment. I stood at the bar to wait for my friends to arrive. Â The bartender was quick and attentive and the red sangria was flavorful but not overpowering. Â The bar area is long and narrow and can get crowded but we were seated promptly for a reservation. Â We were seated in the lower level in front of the wood-burning fire. Â The atmosphere was cozy and I would recommend it for a nice dinner out with friends or a date. The waitress was knowledgeable of the menu (as there are about 50 things to choose from) and she helped recommend a few of her favorite dishes. Â We ordered two dishes per person and shared amongst the table and also all shared a few bites of one dessert. Â Overall, a very nice ambiance and helpful staff but the food isn't as great as you can get at Pipa. Pulled Pork Empanadas sweet & spicey cilantro dipping sauce - By far the tastiest thing we had. Â However, this portion is VERY small, only two bite size empanadas...I think everyone in our group would have ordered this plate again just for themselves Crispy Brussels Sprouts fuji apples, crÃ¨me fraiche, pistachio nuts - The second favorite hit at our table, who knew bussels sprouts could be so good Fried Goat Cheese - I'm not big on goat cheese but my friends thought it was a hit Avocado Relleno with crabmeat & shrimp - The avocado was fresh, but there wasn't much more to offer in flavors Coca (Catalonian Flatbread) oven roasted mushrooms, fresh ricotta, truffled boschetto - Tasty but very difficult to cut and share amongst the table Paprika-potato Gratin - This didn't do anything for me...if you want a good potato dish, go for the patatas bravas at Pipa Ricotta Parmesan Gnocchi tomato & piquillo pepper sauce, pancetta, pesto - This dish was very bland",-1
"This restaurant is really great. Fantastic tacos. Once I has the fish tacos (very fresh and light with lots of flavor) and once I had the pork tacos (also flavorful and more filling then the fish tacos). We shared a steak quesadilla as an app, which was OK. Drinks were really good with lots of alcohol. Our server was very attentive and very friendly.",-1
"I had the turkey burger, it was very Â flavorful. Served on a sweet Portuguese bun plus very good sweet potato fries! Definitely good quality food here if after becoming another chain.",-1
Nice traditional Cuba food;),-1
I know there are many burger places in Brooklyn to choose from but this is my favorite. The burgers are delicious and made with meat from my favorite butchers. The grilled cheese is perfect as is the BLT. Greek Salad is large and fresh. Full bar to keep me liquored up! And any place that serves good onion rings is a winner with me. I go there every time I visit my mom.,-1
"Searched for brunch on Yelp and found this to have one of the highest ratings with around 400 reviews! Most of the reviews were great, so I had high expectations. We got there at around 3 p.m. and were seated right away. I opted for the prix fixe of egg benedict. It was served with grilled potatoes and caramelized onions, along with a glass of orange juice and cup of coffee. The food came right away, but that's probably because it seemed everything was prepared before we got there. The muffin tasted a bit stale and otherwise cold. The potatoes were also oily, like they had been sitting out. They, too, were only lukewarm. Don't get me wrong -- it was good, but would have tasted better if it was made fresh. Our fault for showing up in the last hour of brunch, I guess. At any rate, the bill totaled $15 per person. Decent price. In the end, I am not sure I would come back here again, but it was fun to try.",-1
The wait can be a drag so get a group of 5 and make a reservation. This place is yummy & cozy! The slow roasted pork sandwich for brunch is out of control yummy. Did someone say pickled green tomatoes?,-1
A great addition to the neighborhood. Â Its a great place to grab a drink after work or on the weekend. Â Relaxed atmosphere and great beer list. Â I can't wait to try the food.,-1
Great food at a good price! Â Nice older place.,-1
Wow... makes me wanna scream AI SHI TTAE RU! Im in Japan here.,-1
"Whenever I am in Flatiron, I always try to stop by eataly. Â This place is amazing. Â Sure, it is almost always crowded (especially on Â Saturday), but the pizza is some of the best in NY hands down. Â To be fair, I haven't tried most of the restaurants inside, since the pizza is so good, I always go there. Â I do the margarita pizza but there is one with basil and tomatoes that is amazing as well. Â This past trip I had the barbera with the pizza which was a great combo. Â Would definitely recommend!",-1
Went here with about 6 of us which is not a good idea- the place is TINY. Thai is one of my favorite foods and was not that impressed with this place after reading all of the great reviews. The pad thai was average and I probably wouldn't go here again unless I was in the area.,-1
"This is one of our special occasion restaurants when we want to get together with friends and are not quite sure of their food preferences. Isabella's has a pleasant and varied menu and a nice selection of wines at reasonable prices. We have always found the waiters friendly and with a detailed knowledge of the menu and the food preparation. I am a big fan of the mushroom ravioli (great light pasta) and never disappointed. Save room for dessert. The chocolate ""bag"", which I guess is their signature dessert, is just wonderful. You may want to split it. Yum!",-1
What the hell happened to the menu???? Don't try and hid the fact that you're going to give even smaller portions for a cheaper price! You've become another fake ass restaurant .,-1
"The ambience is incredible, extremely romantic, and very cool. Attentive service. Â Charcutero, croquettes, Pork special with tasty, juicy meat and crispy skin. The atmosphere was romantic, intimate and cozy which was perfect for a romantic date. So happy we came here and looking forward to coming again.",-1
"Salt Alert Greeting- a women just stood there and smiled. I didn't know if she worked there or was hitting on me. The hipster behind the podium had nothing to say Vibe- Alice in wonderland meets the hobbit Price- expensive Bathroom- unisex - failure Service- friendly table turning bandits Parking- after six pm the street opens up Wine by the glass is a rip off. And the poor selections make this one of the worst wine by the glass choices in the city. $16 Beckman Cab Sav Food $21 burger with shoestring fries. The cheese overwhelms the burger. Poor choice of cheese. The bun is great, the beef is ordinarily tasty. It looks better than it tastes. Cross hatching on bun and an abundance of shoestring fries make this dish too pretty to eat. Dessert Banana toffee pie is too sweet. Flourless chocolate cake is a cliche WIGB? No Talk about over rated. This is it. You are packed in at cafe tables with mushroom stools to sit on. Â The bar has a limited amount of stools. Why this place has global recognition I do not know. Anyone who waits to get i here is crazy. The burgers were so salty tonight that they would make a fish's lips shrivel. If you threw one of these burgers into the Hudson River it would turn into the Dead Sea. Another typical example of over salted restaurant food. We have sodium sickness. The famous reviews about this place are. Once again BS. $109 for two burgers, two glasses of wine,one beer and two slices of pie. Crazy!",-1
"This is a great place to have in the neighborhood! I've been there a few times, sometimes for food and sometimes just to chill at the bar. They have some delicious drink specials and the bartender who is usually there is really awesome, funny, and friendly. The turkey burger is great and my friends have said the regular burger is good as well. I do agree that portions are on the smaller side, compared to some burger joints, but it gives you more room for the Greek fries! which are the strangest but most awesome side ever.",-1
"Bistango is cozy and welcoming. It's a no attitude, no nonsense sort of place. It would probably be somewhat forgettable if it wasn't for it's extensive gluten-free options, including pastas that are rarely found in gluten-free form. Dinner has typically been excellent here, although there are some menu options that could be improved. The chicken and salmon, for example, are great, but the Pork is a little dry. Brunch is somewhat of a let down so I haven't given the restaurant a full 5. But if you're looking for a reliable, reasonably priced neighborhood restaurant or a gluten-free option, this is a great choice!",-1
"I enjoyed the mussels thoroughly. The rocket salad was kid of slapped together and I think they should put in more effort to present it even if it is such a simple dish. My companions had the steak and salad which they liked. It's too noisy for a serious conversation but I think if you are looking for an East Village bustling experience, this can be quite a fun place to hang out. The crazy huge parfait desserts are so delicious and decadent. Our blueberry cheesecake parfait was so yum, we finished it despite the fact we were already stuffed.",-1
"BEWARE!!! - Â DIRTY! Â - Â BAD SERVICE! 1) Â DIRTY - I witnessed the prep chef pick up garbage off the floor to throw out and then immediately afterwards went right back to prepping orders without changing his glove. Â ALSO, the floor of the prep area and kitchen was filthy which is a very indicator of a kitchen's general level of cleanliness and hygiene. 2) Â TERRIBLE SERVICE - I walked in and ordered 2 empanadas for take away. Â I paid for my order and sat down to wait. Â After waiting there for 15 minutes and witnessing the above, I left without my order. Â The restaurant was not busy at all. Â The staff were all chatting with each other AND several of them were eating as they chatted and did minimal work. Â All that they had to do was to heat up 2 empanadas, yet they failed to do so. Â Disgraceful...",-1
"The only reason I hesitated writing a review is because I want this to be my best kept secret. I am absolutely in love with everything that juliana's has to offer. Service... From the moment we walked in, everyone is so kind! They have a small staff but are quick to help the moment they are free. The owner is there almost every evening and is kind beyond words. It's such a refresher compared to a lot of service here in the city.",-1
"I finally was able to get a reservation for lunch, there was 4 of us and we ordered more items than what we needed, but took the rest with us. We had Veal Parm, Manicotti, Spag. Bolonease, Chicken Sali. and a hot antipasta. Â Each dish was as good as the next....The service was good and the leftovers was tasty....but better at the restaurant, served hot and piping. Â The bread basket contained a variety of types which was great. Â We also had the Tiramusi.....huge portion and quite good.",-1
"Overrated. Just from the name/concept/reputation... prices... you tend to expect more. If the service were friendlier or the prices lower I may have come away with nice things to say. I suppose it's worth it to try it once. But, once is all you need.",-1
"It is good, over priced but really quality stuff. You should go to check it out, but wouldn't recommend shopping there.",-1
everything is a very good. but too crowded in the restaurant;(,-1
"I love everything about this place, especially Bam and his homemade artisanal beef jerky! So good. The truffle pizza blows my mind every time.",-1
"The waffle looks innocent enough from a distance... but when you're done, you'll want 10 more. A+ orange pressÃ©. Breakfast dreams.",-1
The food is consistently very good but what stands out are the burgers! The atmosphere is basic but the service is welcoming!,-1

"LOVE IT!! food is v moderately priced and portions are fantastic. be prepared to eat! (and drink... greek wine is quite good) i've been a few times, here's what i've really enjoyed 1. the spreads. just amazing. must order! 2. grilled octopus every1 raves about 3. meatball appetizer 4. sheep's milk dumpling 5. lamb shank 6. rabbit pasta. v tasty, for those squeamish about rabbit, you prob won't notice the diff, except that it's v tender for my friends that was skeptical about greek food, it's so affordable that any1 can certainly afford to give it a try. also had a bday dinner for a friend of mine, the staff was amazing about taking care of a loud bunch",-1
"I've tasted better. Yea, it's good macarons but I've tasted better for so much cheaper. Â My jaw literally dropped when I saw how much I had to pay for two small boxes. Â I had tried them before when a friend bought them for me, and remember thinking they were good but nowhere near its hype. Â I decided to give it another try when a few friends from out of town were visiting and wanted to buy some macarons from Laduree. Â I thought it would be better this time around since I would be eating it ""fresh"" and I get to chose the flavors; alas, I was bit with bitter disappointment as it tasted even less impressive than the first time. Â No more Laduree....no more.",-1
"Best Pork and Preserved Egg Congee in NYC. Awesome wonton noodle soup. No service, but who cares. Food is amazing.",-1
"A very small place. We were ther for Sunday brunch. The place is very popular so get there early if you don't want a long wait. Excellent food. Our group of four had four different items and all were very good, from kale salad to a breakfast sandwich to southern fried rice. Service was outstanding, very friendly. I'd definitely recommend this place and would go again without hesitation.",-1
"I am not a food expert, but this place knows how to prepare potato. Simply the best. And inexpensive. Me and Sherri just loved Belgians. Will definitely visit this place again.",-1
"This place is so convenient to Times Square and gives HUGE family-style portions. We had the Chicken Parmigiana and Shrimp Scampi and both were delicious and plentiful. The Caesar salad was the best I've ever had! The service was only ok. Took a while to get service/drinks after being seated, my silverware was missing a fork and it took a long time to find anyone to even ask for a replacement while the rest of the family was eating all the salad! It was a bit of an annoying start, but ultimately the food made up for it.",-1
"One of the best and most consistent restaurants in the city. I go to market table at least 2 -3 times a month and the food is always consistent. I used to love the fresh falafel and am sad they removed it from the menu. the eggplant parm is amazing! biscuits are to die for. And pancakes? I dont even like pancakes, but i love theirs. light, crispy edges with fluffy center. and an added bonus for never having to wait for a table. Waitstaff is great too!",-1
This Guys made Food trucks the bomb ! Thank goodness Mayor bloomie never shut them . Clean good food . white sauce with lamb hot sauce is the ticket big portions always fresh and tasty worth the 45 minute wait ...,-1
Food was average. Nothing exceptional. Flatiron steak was flavorless and gamey tasting. Broccoli rabe side dish was extremely bitter and hard to eat. Â The experience was not unpleasant I would prefer a better thought out plate.,-1
"Blue Ribbon has a neighborhood feel. The oysters are wonderful, local brews are great and they have nice wine selection. We had apps at the bar because that is what we like. The bartender was very attentive and helped us to decide what to order for food. All the selections did the trick. From the ribs to the salt and pepper shrimp, we loved them all. Try them out if you want a pint and a snack or go all out for dinner. The food is excellent, atmosphere beautiful and the service is top notch!",-1
LOVE. Great food. Best bloody mary EVER! Brunch is overcrowded.,-1
"Johnnys is a staple in the area. Greasy spoon type place with the nicest people in NYC running it. Doesnt take credit cards, so come prepared, pull up a stool and enjoy delicious turkey bacon, omlettes, pancakes, sandwiches, fries, etc. etc.",-1
"I'm a fan of grimaldi's. Â The pizza isn't the best, but still good. The service is quick, but you might be waiting a while to get a table. The staff is friendly, until you ask more than 3 questions. Prices are cheap. And don't pull out a credit card, that kind of sorcery is not accepted here, according to the waiter.",-1
It is the best sushi I have ever had.... the fatty tuna is a dream....,-1
"It was noisy but a good atmosphere, maybe not too romantic as you may have to shout. Waiter was helpful and recommended dishes for my daughter who is vegan. Wine was good, food was excellent, yes I would go back. I had the branzino fish, perfectly cooked.",-1
"Oh, how I love the service and quality of dishes. Â If only the tables were better spaced such that guests could better appreciate atmosphere with some degree of privacy.",-1
"This place is pretty nice! Staffs are friendly, decor is quite authentic, and space is not small at all for a Japanese place. I tried uni soba, the sea urchin thing, it wasn't bad but thought it could be better. I like sea urchin sushi but it was a little different than I thought when it was on the soba. I'd like to go back and try something else.",-1
"Amazing bar. Have a large choice of wine, wiskie and have a nice workers. can meet with friends and have some meeting there too.",-1
Delicious food. Fast service.,-1
when they're on their game it's one of the best ramen joints in town. Â sanshiro is a bit better for their shio and shoyu broths. Â totto is very inconsistent though. Â when they're off their game it's totally not worth it...,-1
Great Mexican restaurant. French Press Coffee and Brava what a delight. food that is delicious and staff that is friendly and attentive! This is a local restaurant you will have to visit more than once!,-1
Great atmosphere and a terrific place to hang out with friends. Food was good. Make a reservation to avoid the wait.,-1
Salmon Tartare and the Beet salad. Both were delicious. We ate at many restaurants but the food here was one of the most enjoyable and the least expensive!,-1
Very good ramen. Very good pork bun. Their food is consistently good. Con. Overpriced (ramen are $16???). Long wait ( they said the wait is one hr but i ended up waiting two hr). It would be nice to give an exact time so i can do other stuff in union square instead of just waiting.,-1
"Went here with a friend a while ago & sometimes still go when I'm looking for a delicious, cheap, and quick meal. Usually get the pork or shrimp dumplings and I'm never disappointed. The physical space is pretty small with only a few able to eat inside at one time and I've never had problems with the service here. Great meal!",-1
Delicious food and fun atmosphere. I recommend to go here for after work or on the weekends. Â The Grits are soo yummy and the mini muffins they give are absolutely delicious.,-1
"this small restaurant had me at hello. the wine list is provocative, but the food is truly seductive. Â flavour runs a muck in each dish, slightly spicy but never overbearing. sweetbreads are a must. the space is quaint bordering on cramped but somehow it adds to the charm. I can't get enough.",-1
Some of the best.,-1
The restaurant is small with limited seating. It is located in Greenwich Village in a very quiet neighborhood away from the busy traffic. The best seating is by the window where you can people watch. The setting was romantic. Food was delicious and service was great! I ordered the pork and my friend ordered the lamb shank which very tasty. Other choices were the Crispy Chicken which looked good! We ordered a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced ($35). If you are in New York City take time to go to Greenwich Village and try the LIttle Owl. You will not be disappointed!,-1
"Came here last year with friends from Colorado. We had a great time with a nice bottle of wine and some great pasta, fish and chicken dishes. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it, slightly romantic, with excellent service.",-1
All I have to say is yum! This place is wonderful! I look forward to heading back here really soon,-1
"Definitely lives up to all the hype. We arrived around 9:00AM on a Sunday, gave our phone number, and were texted within about 35 minutes that our table was ready. The pancakes couldn't have been better, plus they have fried green tomatoes!",-1
"First off, make sure to get there early! Â If you're going on a saturday night, and you have more than two people... chances are is that your wait is going to be upwards of 30 minutes if not more. Â  I ordered the chicken fried steak. Â It was okay... a little dry and needed some extra gravy. Â When I initially asked to order some gravy, the server indicated that he couldnt give me an extra side. Â I was a little disappointed. Â OK fine. Â I was REALLY disappointed. Â How hard could it be to have a customer pay for an extra side of gravy? Â A few minutes later, he surprised us with a side! Â And all was well. Â In fact, all was even better! Â It was awesome! The desserts were incredible. Â The bourbon pecan pie and the banana cream pie were ALL out of this world. Â I'd do it all over again in a heart beat. Â Be careful with the bourbon pecan pie though... that was definitely a shocker. Â The bourbon was so strong!!! Would I find my way back here? Â Definitely. Â For what? Â Just the desserts!",-1
"A dangerously good place to go before a nice LES dinner... Dangerous because the (double strong) lychee martinis happy hour, especially if you sit at the bar, has led to more than one stumble home. If you come after work before a dinner, a martini or two with a plate of crispy yet tender calamari will take the edge off before a nice dinner for sure. Would try to avoid when it is probably on the Th-Fri-Sat Bridge n' Tunnel run, but otherwise it is a great value with a great drink.",-1
"After making reservations two weeks before and confirming 3x by phone, we went to Cuba for a birthday dinner for ten; eight of us showed up five minutes before the reservation and stepped into CHAOS. We were told by a frenzied hostess to wait at the bar. Five minutes later, the remaining two of our party showed up. Forty minutes after THAT, we still hadn't been seated though we could see a lot of large tables available downstairs. We were told that those downstairs tables were ""reserved"" (!!!) by the MANAGER (!!!).",-1
"The bar is such a great spot and has so much character! Over 100 some beers from $6-$12 bucks, Â and the food is great too. The shepherds pie is AMAZING and comes in a pan!!",-1
Great burger and great service! Best managers in town: arno e Alessio,-1
"I was looking forward to coming here based on the reviews, 1st time I tried for lunch there were about 7 people downstairs which made it crowded (it is so small) so we had to leave and ended up at Frances Tavern Tried it a 2nd time when a coworker told me they opened the 2nd floor for lunch. We got there early which was a good thing as it got busy. First of all the bench seating on the 2nd floor does not match the table height, the benches are way too high or tables way too low which ever way you want to look at it! It made it super super uncomfortable trying to have lunch. They seemed to put a lot of money into the place yet they couldn't measure the benches properly???? The food is only ok, there are much better options in the FiDi area for lunch. The apps were greasy and the steak sandwich was tough. Server was sweet however I will try it at night time again to see what it's like but on this experience it is going to have to majorly up it's game before it can get me to leave my favorite cocktail den-Vintry",-1
"First of all, I don't recommend delivery since by the time the pizza gets there, it's a bit soggy and cool. Â You can tell the pizza wants to be good but the aforementioned detracts. Secondly, DO NOT GET THE CAPRESE SALAD. Â I don't know if it was because we had delivery or what but for $11 we got a lump of buffalo mozarella and like 4 cherry tomatoes cut in half (not joking; luckily we had extra cherry tomatoes and balsamic lying around to supplement). Â And here's the cincher, they raised the price of the salad from $9 to $11 recently! Â Now either the recent BP oil spill caused a run on buffalo mozarella or it single handedly wiped out the cherry tomatoes in North America, I don't know but it sure was a rip off.",-1
"Came on a Thursday afternoon for brunch and I left a happy customer. Not elated, just happy. This is a nice place if you're just looking for an ordinary and decent place for breakfast, nothing that'll blow your socks off. It's a small cafe with a very family-friendly atmosphere. The guy next to me ordered a tall glass of milk with his baked eggs (which looked fluffy and savory) and the waitress proceeded to remind him that not only his eggs, but his milk was also organic. Not bad. The prices are a bit high for what it's worth. I ordered the french toast, which came with what tasted like homemade whip cream and fresh fruit. The bread was moist and sweet even without the maple syrup. For 9 bucks, it tasted just average. My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich. Don't make the same mistake. Save yourself 12 bucks and just get the baked eggs. Overall, I would come back to this place if I was just in the area. Nothing to get crazy about.",-1
I am sorry but I was born in the middle east and I know what good food is! This is not close to good food. It is a mix of flavors that do not go along! very disappointed even though the place has a great concept and decor.,-1
Place is ok. Food was ok.,-1
"My boyfriend and I tried this place the other day, the food is really good. The pasta was perfect and the price is very reasonable. We had bruschette with the wild mushroom and ricotta cheese and truffle honey, they taste amazing. Mini veal meatball was so good too, especially the bread stick that come with it, sooo delicious. Â We had the red sauce seafood pasta, that was really good too. The best is their Gnocchi!!! They are so soft and yummy, best Gnocchi we had in NYC. Place is very cozy, we love the ambiance. Definitely recommend couples to come here for dinner on a date night.",-1
"The food is excellent, but the staff is embarrassing. They've unapologetically messed up my order three times. Today was the same old thing except when I called to ensure the persisting problem was not repeated, I got a whole lot of tude from the lady in the ""delivery department"". Look lady, I'm paying $15 for a falafal that should cost $4 -- this stuff should come wrapped in gold leaf.",-1
"This is one of the best gyros in NYC. Â This is a genuine Gyro place where the gyro is on the spit and roasting all the time until the moment the meat is sliced for you to eat - perfectly juicy gyro meat. Â I have been a dedicated Village resident from NYU days and always returned to NYC to go to Yatagan (closed and replaced by a Turkish place that is clean and good but more expensive) and Mamoun's but the trip to the Village for my cravings is a stretch and I was fortunate fo find Istanbul Kebab House. Â  The sandwich lunch special (12-2 weekdays, 2-4 weekends and soda is great $6-7 total but the quality is fantastic - they actually grill the kebabs and Kubideh fresh- I have had four different sandwiches and the mixed grill platter. Â  The gyro meat sandwich portion is very generous. Â The white sauce is excellent. They also offer grilled Branzini (must try next) at a reasonable price compared to the restaurants. Â The lemon soup was great. Â  Their food is better than you would find in Turkey and as good as any place in the village although I prefer Mamoun's for the falafel. Â  The meats here are phenomenal and the place is super - clean. Â The bathroom, everything and their Turkish soda is worth trying. Â  It is easy to miss, small front, but they also allow BYOB and there is liquor store within a few stores away. Â  And it is perfectly located, near the Theatre district so that I can get to the show on time and MOMA . Â It is great that I can do all my favorite things in NYC and eat well Â within blocks of each other. Â  I don't have to go to the Village to eat well and reasonably.",-1
There staffs were nice enough to let me sit at the bar while waiting for my friend to arrive. They gave us a seat in the corner for more privacy. I love the wine list! The waiter was nice enough to offer us same price to a bottle of Red that was not available. It was a weekday and glad it was not really busy . I had the duck and foigras ravioli and it is to die for. My friend had their spaghetti and it was just OK. Over all I would like to eat here again and perhaps my friend just choose a general dish.,-1
"it's my local. pizza is great, thin crust, wood fire oven. all the food is good and the personnel friendly. can't go wrong there.",-1
Great atmosphere. Great prices. Great experience.,-1
Delicious singapore mai fun.,-1
"The crepes are delicious -- both the sweet and savory. But you should go over the weekend, because they make these fabulous cookies that are not super sweet. Coffee is not bad either. Price is very affordable.",-1
The food is absolutely fantastic and they have a good variety of brunch menu drinks. Â  The portions were decent sized and the food was not overpriced as is common with French restaurants. Yum! I recommend getting any of the eggs Benedict for brunch. Perfect flavors. I will definitely go back to try the brunch menu.,-1
"OMFG. Is that allowed on yelp? Well, it needs to be, because that is what my taste buds said when I popped a frite doused in mango chutney into my mouth. The fries are humongous, and a large (to stay) can be too much for 2 people with medium appetites. The to go portions, oddly, are double the to stay portions. Don't know why. I don't really care. It's the sauces that are the important part. We also got the wasabi mayo, and the rosemary garlic mayo. They tasted like what we expected them to taste like. Enjoyable, but not mind-blowing like the mango. Can't wait to go back and try the pineapple one! Love the tables with the holes for the cones. Wish it wasn't as cramped so big groups could have a good time, but it's what you make of it. Get a to go portion and savor it in Tompkins Square Park as you watch the interesting folk of alphabet city go by!",-1
"One of my favorite places for a lovely outdoor meal. Its just a cafe but with flowers all around and candles on the tables it makes it special.The food is terrific - may favorites are the Fish Taco and the Skirt Steak + the blueberry lemonade. The staff are friendly and the manager, Eric, is terrific and very helpful. The sunset over the Hudson can't be beet.",-1
"I got the $12 combo platter....what an overpriced waste of food. It was mostly salad and sauce. In the picture there was a ton of meat. But the guy put on just a few pieces of lamb in the combo. For that amount of money, I expected a lot of chicken, lamb and beef. But what I ended up getting was a mix of salad and a large side of hummus with a few pieces of lamb. I'm better of sticking to the street halal cart.",-1
