### NLP_Text-Mining

The data is from YELP Review dataset and has been labeled. Positive reviews: 1/ Negative reviews: 0

In this project, I have used TF-IDF and Bag of words model for text vectorization/feature extraction, and have applied Logistic models / KNN / Decision Tree / Random Forest Classifier / Bayes Classifier / SVM for model fitting. I measured the model performance by runtime and final accuracy rate on train set and test set. The results show that Decision Tree Classifier has the best performance with a runtime of 2.9s and an accuracy rate of 0.67 on test set.

update 04/01: tf-idf for feature extraction, dimension reduction using pca, visualization with t-sne; dask applied
