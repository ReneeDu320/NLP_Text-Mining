cool cool coooool spot
"Been here a bunch of times with friends for dinner on Friday/Saturday nights. Really solid Mexican, great drinks, and the guac is a MUST get. Not perfect though ... even though each time I've been here I've made reservations, we've always had to wait, once upwards of 30 minutes."
The smell coming out of this place is AMAZING!!! The service wasn't all that... I felt outcasted because well... their loss not mine!
Yummy. Mad cheap.
"One word: kassulet. It's to die for. I also love the side veggies included with each entrÃ©e. I was disappointed with the service as they forgot one dish and brought it out late trying to pawn it off as nothing wrong happened. But, I will forgive them for the service because the food is outstanding. For the price, this food meets all expectations and is on par with some of the best."
"Authentic Italian pizza in the middle of bed stuy.. I aint mad at ya lol.. Especially since this is the only late night food spot in the area. They have free WiFi, good coffee and a nice lunch menu during the day plus they'll let you chill out inside for many hours in the afternoon. I'm addicted to the margarita pizza but hardly ever eat in at night because the service is just average especially during the summer months when they seem to be understaffed. Its bizarre because all of the employees are very friendly but the service can get sloppy at night (no water at the table, no additional plates given, missing food, or all the food coming out at once instead of in courses). Â The food is tasty though so i frequent this spot pretty often for take out. Offering delivery would totally take them to the next level.. that would be awesome..."
"I'm not the biggest fan of the food at Juniors as I feel their portions are too large and the meals are often oily and lacking in flavor. The service is also not very good as, the restaurant is often crowded and therefore little attention is given to customers beyond taking your order and plonking your food down. I also don't appreciate that they often print your bill before you've finished your meal, assuming you aren't going to order anything more such as dessert or another beverage. Reading all this I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't give them a lower rating well, there are two reasons: 1) Their cheesecake is honestly the best in the city and I cannot live without it (esp. the strawberry cheesecake). 2) They are one of the few restaurants in the vicinity that has a baby changing table in their restroom... I'm not sure where other restaurants in Times Square and the greater NYC area expect mothers to change diapers. So, if you're a mom with a baby or you LOVE cheesecake... Go on over to Juniors. If however you're looking for good service and tasty food, I would recommend you look elsewhere."
Definitely the best macarons you are ever going to eat. Very expensive. This place is from France and opened up here. It is worth going here at least once or twice or 50 times!
"I always want to go to this place last second, but they are too popular for Â last minute reservations. Â If you do happen to have a night open a few weeks from now, I do suggest making a reservation. Luckly, the last time I went I was with several friends who love to share... Â not like they would really have a choice when eating with me. Â Every dish I sampled was better then the next. Â  Also, the bartender made my Negroni perfectly! Nice work bartender! Â I appreciate that they made the bar seats for diners only. Â It really is a nice business choice, but I would have loved to enjoy my Negroni at a bar. Â haha guess you can't have everything. Â I'll settle for the fantastic food and excellent service."
"Went here for brunch. Â The Bloody Mary was superb, very peppery, how I like it. Â I got the pancakes and they were light and fluffy, and came with a salted caramel sauce that was more like just plain caramel sauce, but still delicious. Â The burrata appetizer was great! (It's one of my favorite things so when I saw it on the menu I couldn't resist) The pesto sauce it came with delicious also. Â I recommend calling ahead and making a reservation."
"I ate here for dinner on a Friday night and had a great experience. I came here with my boyfriend (who's a vegetarian) and had no problem getting a day-of reservation for an early dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty when we were seated but got semi-filled as our meal went on. Our server was personable and friendly. The atmosphere is quiet, casual, and comfortable, but somehow feels a little more upscale than it actually is...which is good thing. We ordered: Deviled Egg sampler - These were great. Not a must-have, but a nice variation on the classic. Artisanal Cheese plate - For 2, this was perfect. The portions were generous and the cheeses were fantastic. $20 sounded steep for this item, but it was worth it. Marinated olives - These were fine but nothing you can't get at the olive-bar of your supermarket. Â  Chicken Pot Pie (me) - Great portion, tons of tender pieces of meat. Served with dressed greens. It was excellent. Mushroom pot pie - My boyfriend had this and I have to say, the bite I had was even better than my chicken version. Tons of flavor! I'd get this next time over the chicken pot pie. Chocolate Stout Cake - Moist, fudgey cake served with kumquats and vanilla ice cream. Nothing extraordinary but very satisfying. Cranberry Brown Butter Cake w/ Rosemary Ice cream - This was amazing! Earthy, rich, and dark. Not to be missed. I will go back here."
"They have lost their touch...or maybe just the formula has become too formulatic... I've been coming here for years, but its over now..."
"Joya, words cannot express how much I love you. Â  We have been regulars here since it opened. Â How can you possibly beat super large portions of awesome Thai food for DIRT cheap prices, and a great atmosphere?? Â  I think the average entree cost (besides the specials, which are yummy) is between $6 - $9, and the quality is excellent. Be prepared to wait for a table if you go during prime dinner time, but you can always go for take-out if you don't feel like waiting."
"I haven't had such a great dinner in a while. I was at Alta a few months back, so when I was in the West Village last night with my husband thinking of a place to eat, Alta was my first choice. I couldn't have picked a better place to end our long weekend. The food here is delicious. It's true gourmet, which honestly I haven't found in a while. It can add up, but honestly I've spent a lot more without enjoying it as much. The flavors, the options, the presentation - all phenomenal. You can't go wrong. Everything we ordered was fabulous."
"If you go doing an off-hour it is 4 stars. Â Pricey, yes, but even if you're just ""window shopping"" it's Â a fun experience."
Cavatelli and half vodka half rubirosa supreme pie is the way to go. The cavatelli is always cooked perfectly. The pizza is thin and very tasty with a nice crisp to it. Staff is super friendly and food comes out fast. Come here for a casual night out.
"You get a decent entree for $10-16. Â The concept is great, and the food is fresh and light. Â Having sampled several menu items, there are many good dishes but the flavors are all somewhat similar."
Greeting - yes Vibe- summer pool club meets harrows pool store inside Service- fast Price- good Bathroom- disgusting Food Square or Sicilian slice $2.50 is not big. The corner slice is the only way to go Triangle or regular slice is not good Spumoni $3 small. Vanilla chocolate pistachio mix. Tastes like a mix between ice cream and sherbet. Love it or not I keep trying this pizza when I am in the neighborhood Trying to figure out the hype Overall I don't care for the pizza here it's inconsistent. Some days it tastes too much like bread other days it has a lemon taste to it and days like today it was just right. I would not make a special trip to eat here. If you die and go to heaven without ever eating a slice from L&B the gates will still open up for you. WIGB? Not on purpose
"D: How I have never heard of Woorijip before I met C is beyond me. Â A small place near the end of KTown but it always has people in it, even in the early morning hours. Â Great combination of price and food. Â There's a per-pound buffet section, as well as prepared hot and cold foods. Â I've had so many random dishes there, from the spicy rice cakes with octopus, to the chicken lo mein, to the tofu pancakes. Â Have had nothing to complain about and it's a great place to go when you can't decide what you want so you just grab everything. Â Most of the dishes come in under $4, so getting two or more won't dent your wallet all too bad. C: Was introduced to Woorijip in my Freshmen year in college for their yummy rice cake stew. My friends are I are frequent customers for late night soju runs here too. Often would grab seats in the back and stay til closing. Â Everything I've tried taste great! Especially love the Kimbap and kimchi fried rice. Everything is super cheap and filling. Definitely satisfy my Korean food craving! Will try the per pound buffet section next time!"
"Friendly staff. Delicious food. Adorably cozy-bordering-cramped space. Blue bottle coffee. Speaking of coffee, you can get a cup of blue bottle here, or a shot of Stumptown across at the bread joint OR counter culture beans (GOD) at Formaggio Kitchen. Boss. I've had the guac and chicken tacos and both were amazing. I'll try anything they make, its damn good. Price is high by Mexican standards but you get what you pay for."
Are we serious? Great place and atmosphere. This is a must try NY restaurant. Exceeds expectations on every aspect. Thank you all for a wonderful experience.
"This place is freakin' delicious! Â And you'll notice that half of the diners on any given night are Asian (mainly Japanese). Â The prices are reasonable and the Spaghetti served with the garishly large Kraft Parmesean cheese bottle is such a guilty pleasure. Â The Pork belly and cabbage, shrimp tempura and yellow fin fish are among some of the most amazing dishes! Â Also the momo sour drinks are deceptively potent! Â Go here, but be prepared to wait at least half an hour and as long as an hour and a half!"
Great food!!! Good for brunch.
"Total surprise at how incredible this place is overall. Fabrizio (barman/owner/genius) really seemed to care about the food and our opinions on it. You can tell that they worked long and hard on seasoning and flavor. Very impressive. Ambiance: so cool you can't find the door. Small, but feels like a community regardless of where you sit. Musical rotation skewed 70s-90s punk/alternative with some new rock as well. Perfect for me. (Sweet Afton comparison is spot on). Food: I can't say enough about how happy I was about St. Austere. Great wine, great beers, and the food was simple perfection. Try the ricotta, the fried artichokes (grab the lemon) and the polenta. Â The tasting menu was perfect -- wintery and light at the same time. Service: We were at the bar and had a bit of a hook-up, so it was top-notch, but the other, less juiced in people got the same level of service. I recommend doing a tasting for two and choosing a wine or two (I went beer and was not disappointed) to go with it. If you are unhappy here, it is your fault."
So so
"This a a pretty mellow lunch or even after work early dinner. The food is decent, the service is very good and personable, like you bff is taking your order. The drink are really good and strong. Over a great place with affordable prices."
"best. ramen. ever. if i could i would eat this everyday, but the wait is rather long. no matter when you go, there is always a wait. the longest i have waited is an hour and half but it's so worth it. it's soo goodd. the tuna appetizer is really amazing as well. there is a 17 or so pepper labeled ramen. it's really not that spicy. but it's really good."
"This is the most pleasant place to eat in the neighborhood. I love the earthy inside and the big picture window that makes up the front wall (opened up in nice weather, closed when it's sweltering or cold out) and the garden out back is really nice, a perfect oasis. I've only had lunch food, but it's a great place to sit and chat or have a meeting over lunch. They have a nice selection of tasty sandwiches, two soups of the day, and offer nice soup/salad/sandwich combos. The sandwiches come with a small salad anyway, so getting soup and sandwich gets you all three. Their gingerade is really spicy and delicious. Everyone I've interacted with here is really nice, and the atmosphere is so pleasant that I want to go all the time."
"This place has great fried chicken , kale salad, fries and gravy. Most of all the the atmosphere is just super cozy (booths and old bar lights) with a very diverse crowd (old rockers, neighborhood people with kids, guys from boardwalk empire in their garb, girlfriends grabbing dinner). The staff is really welcoming. The first time, I went there, the bartender was playing Roky Erickson on the stereo which made my night and I have been back many nights since. I would recommend to stick with their standards - beer / chicken / salads/ mashed potatoes- the pasta I tried was just ok. It would be a good place to take out of town guests for an unpretentious, casual time. Jimmy's reminds me of old Williamsburg - a great neighborhood spot."
"So,,I've gotten there chicken curry at least 1/2 dozen times since they opened. No complaints. The breast is always crisply fried, rice is decent, if not a little bland, and the curry sauce is really not what u would expect, unless u are expecting it. I have no desire to eat in, it's a little cramped for me, but the service has always been quick. If you have not tried it, go ahead, you will probably be happy with it :)"
hate waiting forever to get a burger but its def worth the wait. love coming here and its a great fast food place.
"A real experience from the minute you walk in to the minute you walk out. Â Nothing Â else like it. As for the food, it's pretty good, Portions are large, and the service is great. Â Go if you can get in."
"Finally got to eat at abc kitchen. Their menu is farm-to-table, with the farms listed on the reverse side of the menu. Very creative food beautifully presented. Everything is made on site, including the yummy gelato. Service was wonderful and the food delicious! except for the very noisy front dining area where the bar is, the back room was charming a peaceful."
"Chic (in that pared down sort of way that's popular these days) ambiance. My jacket kept falling off the back of my non-angular chair-- annoying, but the wait staff was diligent about keeping an eye on it for me. The food was mediocre--a gimmicky menu that's mostly talk with little taste. The vegan at our table was impressed."
Falafel and chicken kabab sandwich is grt!
Confession: I've worked for Mexican restaurants in the past. So believe me I am biased. The staff here is great. The Margs are killer. There should be a warning not to let me know 2 or else chaos. But the food. I am sorry but its not that good. I've been here many time and I just don't like it at all. Last time I came in I WAS STARVING and generally digusted with my food. There is nothing particularly wrong with it. The food sure is cheap... but bleh... please get this off my table plz ASAP. Its always packed here so maybe the I'm the only one that feels this way... but I am just so uninspired.
"I've been here twice for brunch, and the food is pretty good, but it's VERY loud and the portions are on the small side. I actually strained my voice today trying to yell at my friend across the table over all the noise in the restaurant. We ordered biscuits to start with. The biscuits were tasty, but the jam it came with was very tart. I got the cheddar grits, which weren't overly cheesy. My friend got the kale salad, which was good. She got the eggs on top, which seemed pretty weird to me, but she liked it. I was still hungry when we left, which is disappointing considering we also got a starter."
"Love their fries and bread but the noise, crowd, and poor service makes the dining experience not so great."
"New location on 14th between 2nd and 1st is even closer to me, so even better! I think their spicy sauce is stronger now. Other then that best halal you will ever find. The staff is so friendly and chill. Only downside is when you order inside the restaurant it costs more, I believe $7 and some change, but hey that's what happens when you have to pay rent in the city."
The only place I go to in the city when I crave Ramen!!! It's that good- and the price is decent. The only con is the long line...
"OMG, we were in Saigon (HCMC) last year, the quality of Banh Mi at this place equals any of the street Banh Mi's you can get in Saigon. Love this place. I picked up 20 sandwiches for a company picnic $50. can't beat it."
"I haven't dined here yet, but I do love walking around and seeing all the delicious foods and pastries. The lines are LONG at times, but I've braved them to buy a few specialty items and snacks that you'd not likely find elsewhere. Specialty items do come with a premium price at times, but nothing too crazy."
The best spicy ramen in the city. The broth is very tasty and worth the long wait.
"Some of the top pizza in Brooklyn, and that is saying a lot! I just did a pizza tour and got to enjoy an amazing white pie here......seriously, seriously GOOD."
"Nutella French Toast ...delicious, salmon & poached eggs with cranberry salad was very good as well. Â Best brunch spot in Kips Bay area."
"My favourite restaurant. As a devoted organic/local/anything better for the environment and the world in general, I love the concept of using head to tail of the animal. What makes this restaurant so exceptional is that you can eat crispy pig's ears without the squeamishness of ""oh look I'm really eating a pigs ear"". The food is lovingly cooked and beautifully presented. The staff are courteous but not stuffy and always very helpful (as there is always at least two dishes I can't decide between).They also have a good knowledge of the food and wine. I pretty much inhale their rollmops, I've never found any more delicious. True, the wait is pretty long, the trick I've found is to get there nice and early (6.30/7 ish) put your name on the list and then head to the nice little wine bar down the road (Turks and Frogs) share a bottle of wine and some olives and The Spotted Pig will call when your table is ready. It's definitely not somewhere to go for a quick dinner, but a very enjoyable evening if you make the time!"
Watch out Corner Bistro. Burgers are better at Mollys!!!!
"Service: Rude, disparaging, domineering Decor: Drab, dated, dingy Food: Sloppy, unexceptional, fabricated If you're looking for a place that makes the same thing, unchanged since 1988, it's fine. If you're looking for a nice dinner experience, try any of the Carmine's in Manhattan or Rao's in East Harlem."
"This is the place to go if u love tofu, kimchi & spicy soup. I went there 3X in 6 days! Love the whole fried fish that they serve as a free appetizer, along with kimchi, spinach and the usual Korean side dishes. Ask for more if u are greedy :) for the tofu soup, u can choose from different levels of spicyness (just do regular unless u can take real spicy soup). Real yummy! Oh and they are open 24/7!"
I went to Room Service few months ago . we found this place accidently looking for another restaurant in this aria and let me tell you .... I loved it !!! the food was so delicious and beautifully decorated ! I can't wait to go there for more! I'm getting hungry even now just by thinking about it !!I do have little complain about the service but I can get over it since everything else was so perfect :) hopefully next time we get better server who wants to pay little more attention
"If you have a large group in New York, then this is the place to go. This is perhaps one of the best Italian restaurants in New York. It is extremely popular, though, so make sure you make reservations before going. The restaurant is huge and always packed. The menus are largely printed on the walls. Everything is served family-style there. A dish will cost between $20 and $30 dollars but will easily feed four to six people. You get appetizers first with your run-of-the-mill stuffed mushrooms, calamari, salads (you must get the Caeser--it's excellent), and soups."
really nice wine bar all i can said amazing they was so friendly i was really impressed Â im going back there for sure my roommate she tell me abut this place Â i really love it wow
"This place is a classic! The service is outstanding as well as the food. If you are a meat lover go for the steak frites (it's expensive though $34). If you rather her something more ""breakfasty"" go or the eggs on puff pastry!"
Best Grilled cheese sandwiches in the world. will always go back.
Lovely place to find. The owner was our waiter and he was charming and engaging. We enjoyed salad and pizza and were intrigued to find everything locally sourced and organic. This drove the prices up a little but it was worth the atmosphere. Piacere means Pleasure. And it was.
Second time here and loved it again!
The edamame tofu falafel burrito is a collection of all things good. I wouldn't want to see another vegetarian option on the menu. This burrito cannot be topped. Great proximity to Half Court is also a plus.
"This pizza was exactly perfect , thin crust and Â fresh ingredients I will recommend any one to come you will not regret it 4 stars!"
"********* Update, just tried Minca again today, this time spicy miso ramen. Â Very good. Â Little overpowering on the flavor...but still a solid ramen ********* Great toroniku pork ramen. Â Gyoza is soft and pan seared/crunchy. Â I think that the owner/chef try really hard to make a good product here and in my opinion it shows. Â Next week im planning to take a group of 16 people here...haha, so since the place only has 18 seats total we'll see what happens. Â For a place so far east (5th bet a/b) i think overall they do a great job on ramen. Â Looking forward to the new store they are opening on 14th...don't really like taking the f/v."
"he menu has zero non-seafood options, and all of the seafood options are fresh, clean, and feature the fish. The fish entrees are cooked to perfection and the sauce and veggie parings rock the house. The Soft shell crab sandwich was delicious, they stuff two soft shell crabs between some sort of bun and laced it in green sauce really delicious food here. ."
"This is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is cosy, the service is attentive and the burgers are delicious!"
the best pizza in town really awesome !
"This is my second visit and the sushi and sashimi are just incredible! The only negative point is that they make it complicated to book a table. You have to call, get a reservation number, then call again... a bit irritating. Still the best sushi place ever. Watch out... They do not accept TIPS!!!"
"great food, gluten free lover or not. i couldnt care less and thought all items had great flavor. waitress had a great attitude, and we got the gist... Â dont overstay your welcome. you do and you will probaly get a bit of attitude. you deserve it. will def go back"
"This place is so unpretentious on the outside, I felt like a jerk that I hadn't tried it before. Inside, it's warm and sweet and the service is super friendly and on point. The food itself is incredible; so much better than half of the hyped, trendoid places in Williamsburg. We started with the polenta and gorgonzola which was amazing, as was the griled octopus salad. I can honestly say though that the tagliatelle with lamb shank ragu was better than its counterpart at Del Posto. For real. We were too full to try dessert but we'll definitely be back."
"This is my Asian friend Serena's favorite Asian restaurant, so I heard. Â I'm not a fan of Vietnamese food, except for their sandwiches which are no doubt truly delicous and out of this world. Â But since it gets rave reviews from Serena I wandered into the place on a Thursday afternoon. The decors is the first thing that lacks interests in this place, making it looks like any other Vietnamese places in Chinatown. Â Aside the strong greasy smell hanging in the air, I noticed a pretty large black spot right at the entrance next to the matt close to the cashier counter. Â It has at least 6 inch in diameter and on a closer look I realized that someone just spilled soysauce there. Â Every one in this place was busy, too busy to notice this large spot that I had to point it out to the server in a nice way. I tried one chicken dish with veggies and rice, and another beef sandwich highly recommended by Serena. Â Both dishes were sooooo greasy that after I ate I had to take two Tums to calm my stomach Â The portions are quite large, not normally should be expected in this area where many health concious young people dine. Â I look around the dishes everyone else was eat around me, Â all of them are extra-large portions that could really stuff an animal. Â There much be at least 800-1500 calories in each of these plates! Â Although the beef is very tasty, I had to leave over 70% of the food untouched. Â Even though I doggy bagged them I really had no intention nor appetide to touch them again after I bring them home. As per the service, this is what you nornally would expect to get by spending $20 and less. Â Most of the servers are busy serving other people most of the time, that it took them over 10 minutes to get my bill to my table. Â I do not understand why they can call themselves Asian Fusion when the food itself is classic Vietnamese, without traces of any Â nice presentations or any European influences. Â  So, just another wrong choice listening to my girlfriend. Â It probably had happened way too many times before but this time it had caused me stomach pain. Â Any person with a good sense of taste would not want to waste money and time dining at a place like this, when food has no culinary value and the atomsphere is close to none."
First started coming here when they first opened up. Was good for a few months but totally fell off!! Was forced to go here late night with a few friends who are obsessed with this place still and I couldnt believe I had to waste my time and $$ here..I'll never be going back here thats for sure..
"the food is good and reasonably priced. the service is too fast pace and the staff didn't seem to happy. i go back, although not at busy hours..."
"Food was alright. Service wasn't great. We had about five or six different waiters throughout the course of our meal - some of whom couldn't understand much English, which made things a little difficult."
"Went for a Friday night dinner with no reservations, came early, around 7:00, Â because we had a 9:00 show and were seated by 7:20- not bad for a Friday night. Â Yes- it's really loud and, thankfully, they sat us downstairs in the lounge area where it is MUCH quieter. Â Only one downside: Â the tables are mostly cocktail tables- SO LOW like coffee tables- so you have to be prepared to either hold the food in your lap and eat (like in a living room) or lean over your plates so you don't drip. Â Knowing that- my wife and I ordered food that would work: Â we split a Caesar salad, had the plat de jour- shrimp and grits, and ordered the fish and chips. Â Caesar salad easily had a whole head of romaine topped with a ""one eyed Susan"" meaning a while poached egg covered in panko- perfectly cooked: Â firm white and runny yolk. Â Also came with parmesan ""chips."" Â My wife said, ""the best Caesar salad I've had in a restaurant in years."" Â I agree. Â Be prepared- no anchovies came near this dressing- so if you like that sharp kick in your salad- this is a no go. Â However, a ""sharp kick"" accurately describes the shrimp and grits. Â Delicious in my book, but this is not Low Country food: there's a healthy dose of cajun fire in this sauce which is poured like gravy over everything. Â  Fish and chips were a real disappointment: Â the fish was tender and had good flavor but the batter was SO GREASY and SOGGY. Â Same with the ""chips""- a fist of very thin and limp french fries that were not drained very well. Â No tartar sauce- lots of mayo instead BUT it did come with malt vinegar- a plus in my book. Â Won't order this again. Â Probably won't order french fries here again. Ice cream we had at the end was house made and delicious- strawberry had a nice tang to it and the vanilla had a buttery undertone which made it scrumptious. Service? Â Fun, upbeat and attentive. Â Don't know if we would have gotten the same attentiveness with the rest of the mob upstairs To sum it up- If you like Chelsea, you'll like Cafeteria: Â uber cool, Â comfort food with a twist Â mostly well prepared, noisy fun (lots of loud laughter), Â kinda crowded, flamboyantly out there, disco sound track, waiters flaunting and flirting, chic minimalist decor, etc. etc. Â You get the idea. Â Welcome to the neighborhood."
"Lombardi's is a new york staple. You can't come to the city and experience the deliciously thin crust pizza, the relaxed environs and the friendly service. The secret is in the sauce and the perfect crust. Hot tip: they even deliver to your favorite nearby bar if you get the munchies while your out!!"
"The pizza is to DIIIIEEEE for! I absolutely love this place and have waited on an hour line in the blistering cold just to eat here. This is the ""to go"" place is pizza is your thing. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations so be prepared whatever the weather is like to wait, wait and wait. If you're lucky (which there are times) when there is no line. I live a few blocks away from a new Gimaldi's location but I refuse to dine there because this location is the original one that uses the famed ""brick oven"" which is no longer manufactured."
"Met local friends at the Midtown location. What a treat! Ramen here has no resemblance to the dried, salty packs you may have sampled. Try the pork rolls and any of the broth based dishes."
"I LOVEEEE Gila's Nosh. I have had many items on their menu, whether it be dine in or take-out, and this tiny Israel/Mediterranean restaurant never fails to deliver. The food is fresh, tasty, and AUTHENTIC. The service is always amazing (Gila herself is the sweetest woman) and I always feel like home when I come to eat here. Literally some of the best Israeli food in Manhattan...try the coffee too!! Delicious!"
"Horrible. Â first take-out was fine, not great, not horrible. Â The sit down experience-horrible. Â Slow service, condescending waitress. Had to hail her to finally get her take our order. Monday night, not crowded. Â When ordering I asked if the Pad cashew was mild, and she said yes. I was starving and started eating & my mouth was burning. seriously! Â The dish was littered with dried hot peppers. Â REALLY??? Â Not spicy? Mild? When we complained-they-the waitress and so called manager actually smirked at us. Â Really funny...anyone who knows (has) Barrett's Esophagus knows it's not funny at all. Â Will never, ever, EVER return."
"The food was delicious. Â Can do tapas or entrees, all very freshly prepared. Small, cozy, personal. Great vibe. Lovely experience all the way around. The Lamb Chops were cooked perfectly and served with an array of olives, hummus and couscous."
Was there for lunch yesterday. Food was great! But quite expensive for a lunch; 430$ for 2. Not my everyday lunch! (Including one beer and two small sake carafes).
"I would consider myself very much a meat eater, but if I had to become a vegetarian I think I could live off Nish Nush. I'm glad I took the advice of the owners of Fish and Sip and stopped here great place for lunch. Really fresh food great ambience."
"I have always had a great time at this NY institution. The food is big and supposedly family size, but it's so good I can pretty much polish off a plate solo. You may feel lost in the crowd, and it's a big buzzing place and being in the theater district, it's a little pricier than it's sister locations but this is the original and best."
"Ai Fiori, for a hotel restaurant, is certainly serviceable. It, however, doesn't have that ethereal quality of Marea or the rustic, hearty feel of Osteria Morini."
"Great place, great food, friendly staff."
One of the french place here in LIC. I love it. I had the snail with my friend. The boss was nice too. Small place it is best to have date there.
"A top NYC dining experience, without being pretentious. Located in the heart of the West Village, this restaurant is one you will definately want a return visit to. The atmosphere, service, and especially the food are just downright spot-on! Make a reservation in advance."
chicken platter. Â white sauce. Â all day.
I have been there many times and I am always pleased with the food and service.
"Pretty good Thai place. Good price for NYC. Would go back for a casual dinner, but not a gastronomic experience; just a decent meal."
"UPDATE WATCHED CHEF EATING WHILE COOKING (my food) on the line. Â  Other chefs did not even bat an eye. Â Waitstaff go INTO the kitchen and behind the line to eat and drink, with hair down. Â All of this is visible through the window. DISGUSTING! Â  Continually crappy service from self satisfied servers. Â  Inattentive service from all, my food is ALWAYS wrong (missing something, wrong dish, wrong price, etc), and someone spills on me nearly every time I go there. Â I've been there at least 100 times since the day it opened. Why do I go back? Â Hope springs eternal and the neighborhood has a shortage of options."
"I REALLY wanted to like this place, and while I do love the decor, everything else about the experience was pretty terrible. Our order was messed up (only 1 out of 3 dishes were right), and it was excruciatingly expensive for what was meh to downright bad food (what on earth is going on with that Testa dish?) in teeny-tiny portions. It's everything people hate about Brooklyn, down to the blaring ironic hip hop. We left the place feeling duped."
"expensive, slamming quality"
"This place rocks! I don't know where to start. . We had to sit at the bar for an hour waiting for a table. We had a couple of glasses of wine and everyone looked ecstatic. High intensity place,noisy but fun. Every dish that was passing by we were looking like WOW! When we were seated we felt a bit uncomfortable at the table but it was OK. When the octopus arrived along with the veggie chips everything was forgotten. After the apps we had the halibut in a tomato sauce. That sauce sends you to a different dimension! Overall it must be the best seafood/Greek restaurant I've ever been!"
I went to The Farm for brunch and it was simply fantastic! Love this place.
first time back here in 6 years last night. very very official sushi. a few notches above seki & sasabune. fish quality on par with masa. top 3 in NY for sure.
"Absolutely great. Â Reasonable prices for totally homemade, delicious, proper Italian food in a NON-stuffy/obnoxious environment. Â ENJOY!!! We went with a large group and ordered a ton of stuff, about 1/.2 the menu. Â It was all totally great, not a single miss. Â  GO. Â NOW. I do agree with one other review, too many freakin' servers/busboys. Â There were constantly hands in my face and it got annoying. Â And I hate the ""ARE YOU FINISHED ARE YOU FINISHED ARE YOU FINISHED???"" thing. Â Leave me alone until I am actually finished."
"I was able to sneak in before the rush and get seated almost immedietly. Â I enjoyed the pie, a great thin crust, prices were reasonable and I could have saved more if I opted out of the 16 inch pizza, or whaever the bigger one was."
Service was disappointing. Food was not as good as we remembered but still ok. But service Â was just bad - we were given a table that was too small for our party. We didn't get enough plates or water and had to follow up on the sake we ordered.
Desserts thumbs up :)
"The food here is good, but they charge more (for some strange reason) if you order take out. Â They don't deliver, I get that - it's their prerogative - but if you offer food to go, how do you justify adding up to several dollars PER ITEM?? Â I only ordered take out once, just on principle. Â Not a good policy. Still, I dine in there because the veggie platter can't be beat."
"Went here after midnight and got in with no wait, but the restaurant was definitely full. It's known for being a late night eatery and no kidding! My husband and I went with higher than normal expectations because of the reputation of the place and the fact that we fully enjoyed the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar but we were definitely not as impressed by the food. It was delicious, but forgettable. We shared the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade, chicken wings and the duck breast (and one other dish; can't recall) and again, they were just OK! Would like to go back and try the oysters if they're as good as they say. !"
"My favorite brunch spot in NYC. Really good food, nice vibe. Go early or late for brunch on weekends because during peak brunch times, you may have to wait 1+ hour for a table. Some of the tables are squished too close together so not the best place for a super private / personal conversation."
Yum.
"Great food, great vibe, lovely chef/owner. And the price is right!"
"The food here is OUTSTANDING. I had chicken over rice that was perfectly cooked and ridiculously flavorful. Five stars by any normal account. While waiting on line they even gave us a free piece of falafel. You will never find a crispier falafel anywhere. The only con to it was that it was actually on the dry side. Why the minus stars? They're freakin' -filthy-! Dude. I don't give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady's bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that's the size of my closet. That's normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I've eaten some very questionable food in my time. I was raised Filipino, where i learned to ""pick off the bad parts and eat the rest."" My stomach may not be totally made of iron, but I can handle food from a place the Dept. of Health would rate a C (you can get away with a lot and still get an A/B, I worked in the food bizz for a few years). The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf! I didn't finish my chicken platter the night I got it because: a) It was very filling and b) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it. BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because: a) It was delicious b) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn't eat anything all day. Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. Seriously, if it wasn't for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars. Come here if you like the combination of tasty street food and playing the exhilarating game of seeing how long you can hold your diarrhea before crapping your pants. PS. Ask them to change their gloves."
"Reliable, unpretentious goodness. Microbrews on tap, veggie chili cheese fries, everything cooked in plain sight, efficient and friendly."
Figure in the sales tax on small breakfast orders--it's applied to everything here.
The food was served on trays and in plastic cups. But all the food tasted fantastic and all the meet were tender and delicious. Really enjoyed the evening and atmosphere.
"LOVE this place! The decor is chic, and the food is yummy with farm to table ingredients. Everything went well at ABC Kitch. Â We came for lunch and were greeted with a friendly staff. Â We were seated near the middle of the floor and had great views of all the interesting design and styling of the space. Â Its got a great vibe, with ambient music an conversations that even an intimate couple could enjoy. One thing I love about this place is that they use a lot of fresh local ingredients. I'm a big sucker for that. However, I'm not a big fan of the decor. This is a personal opinion but to me it just looks like they tried too hard. Overall it's a nice restaurant and I would come back."
"Great atmosphere, delicious tapas and sangria and all around great time! Definitely somewhere you want to go with friends- it does get very crowded though- more of a fun/loud/upbeat place- great for brunch!"
"I was jonesing for Malaysian, so I came here on a friday night. We had a brief wait, and after we sat down, we had wait for some time to get a server's attention. For an appetizer, I ordered the chicken satay. I liked the peanut sauce and found the chicken to be appropriately moist and charred. For dinner, I got the prawn mee. The noodles were thin and crunchy, and the broth was excessively salty. I also wished there were more prawn in the dish. Having gone to Singapore and sampled some Malaysian cuisine, I can say that Nyonya is equivalent to a sub-par hawker stall. But if you've got a hankering and no plane ticket, Nyona might satisfy you."
"Where do I begin. The food is excellent. Even when you order delivery. They are incredibly fast and never mess up an order! The staff is so friendly if you eat in the restaurant. It's BYOB, which is a plus. My personal recommendation: the sliced steak plate. melts in your mouth and the ginger chimichurri sauce is outrageous!!!"
"They brought the wrong food. The staff and the manger did not apologies. I had asked specifically asked for vegetarian food but brought a seafood food. When they were told about the wrong dish, they showed attitude instead of apologizing. I made the correct food to go since they spoiled my mood to eat in."
Excellent spot for late night dining -grilled calamari is a favorite.
"Very nice place to have dinner, with great atmosphere and food. We tried the most interesting smoke salmon ever in this restaurant, all dishes made with care, sophisticated and not pretentious, everything to have a good time. Staff polite and efficient."
"I really loved this place! The MEATBALLS were amazing of course. I got ""Everything but the kitchen sink"" which was filling bc it comes with a salad and veggies. My Â boyfriend got the a la cart which I don't think is the best deal, but if your just wanting to try the different sauces and meats then it's ok. Â The sides I will do without next time. We got the sauteed broccoli and it was not great at all, and it was like $8 bucks or something- stick with the meat. The only other note would be that we did have to wait from 7:15pm to..wait for it...9:35pm. If the host hadn't told us it would be only 45min to an hour that would be great, but we just hung around the area till a table opened up for 2 (which brings me to our next sad note). There were actually 2, 2 tops open for over an hour outside, that he didn't let us sit at bc he was waiting to combine for a larger party. My argument to him was that in the hour the table was empty, we could have eaten and left by then. Whatever, the balls were good."
"9/10 for Atmosphere, 10/10 for Service, 18/20 for Food"
"In the heart of Williamsburg, this French Bistro is one of the best the city has to offer. Â The greatest bouillabaisse I've had in New York. Â Lots of garlic in the mussels, which I love. Â Wonderful atmosphere and our server was friendly and worked hard to please us."
"I came here with my roomies on a quest to find the best pizza in NYC/Brooklyn. Â We were shocked to see there was a crazy line at least 30 people long. Â Of course we took this as Â a great sign of what we would be eating. Â WRONG! Â Not only did we wait for 30 minutes outside sweating, we waited another 15minutes once we had our table before we were even acknowledged. Â The three of us let this slide thinking okay maybe this is like a Seinfeld 'soup nazi' situation. Â You aren't there for the service or ambiance only the amazing amazing soup, in this case of course pizza. Â The pie we ordered was actually the worst I've had in NYC. Â It was dry, with no flavor. Â We also ordered some sodas which we never received but were charged for. Â This is 3 hours of my life I will never get back. Â Maybe they're paying people to wait in line."
"Can't wait for the fad to dissipate! For a few weeks, Two Hands was a place where you could calmly read your morning paper while enjoying a cup of coffee. Victim of its success, the place is now cashing in on a crowd desperate to get a seat to quickly (they'll kick you out after a while) ingurgitate the (pricey) food. Too bad, the whitewashed design (successfully borrowed from Happy Bones and Dimes) and the nice vintage touches (Stanley&Sons aprons, Mason jars) made it appear like a good neighborhood coffee shop."
"Outstanding service, amazing rabbit and duck!"
"Yerba Buena is a small charming restaurant occupying what is little more than a storefront in Alphabet City. We visited on a slow cold night in December and were greeted with extraordinary courtesy and attention. The food - best described as ""pan-latin"", was creative and at the same time sufficiently familiar to make one feel comfortably at home. While everything we had was terrific, what stands out is the almost ""old world"" quality of the staff - rarely seen these days. Professional and attentive but not cloying or insistant. A real class act. We will return."
What an amazing food wonderland. We explored each section and decided to eat close to the center of the market where you can choose from a variety from each section. Best to get there early to avoid the crowds. We didn't have any troubles getting a seat at 11:30am on a Saturday. By 12:30pm the wait was up to 45 min.
"My friend at NYU told me I HAD to stop by this place and try the frites. I went with my friend after eating $1 pizza just around the corner and bought a regular size with Vietnamese Pineapple dip. IT WAS SO GOOD. The employees there are also very nice and allow you to try all their flavors if you wish. I wish they had more space inside because we had to eat the fries on someone's door step, although they had seats the 2nd time I went back. Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving something familiar, yet different and unique."
"went there twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Well its OK but not really great. First time we order a bottle of wine, I tried and mention to somellier that it doesn't taste right. He didn't react so I thought maybe it has to open a little, but after a few sip I knew it was corked so I called the waitress and she agreed right away. They brought different kind of wine, well whatever..... my hanger steak came cold, but tasted pretty good, the lamb sliders specials were blend, then came for brunch last week, braised short rib, eggs... were horrible, pretty greasy. At least the service was better. I don't know if I go back any time sooner...."
"This small quiet restaurant is one of our favorites- the crabmeat rice cooked in a coconut is yummmmy! My friends love the pad thai with smoked Tofu! Great crisp bok choi also. If you are near by, you won't be disappointed!"
Their Bistro Burger is as good as any burger you'll ever have. Popular pick for best burger in NYC.
"We came here for brunch (reservations definitely help!) . Â The service is pretty good considering how busy they are. Â The coffee was strong and perfect! Â The food was so good! Â I had the corned beef hash, and it was the best corned beef I have every had. Â And that's normally my heavy breakfast go to dish. Â My hubby had the eggs benedict with salmon and loved it. Â Everything was fresh! Â The ambience was nice although the seating is very crowded together."
"We chose Market Table as the site for a little celebration. We got great service and just couldn't keep ourselves from going all in with the three courses, the Prosecco to start off and a lovely Zin to match the food. Oh the food! The diver scallop crudo was one of the favorite culinary experiences of the week - finely sliced scallop just bursting with flavors from pineapple, jalapeno and lime. The noice level was okay, despite the rather intimate corner location due to the high ceiling and well dispersed table arrangements. Oh, and the deserts were great too, with some unusual gelato flavors and a lovely peach pie. And lastly, we were very happy with the service. Highly recommend it!"
"I've been to almost every Shanghai Soup Dumpling (Xiao Loong Baos aka XLBs) place in Chinatown. I love XLBs. Joe Shanghai is ridiculously packed. Is it worth the wait? Short answer. No. The XLBs are not omfg-its-so-damn-good-best-in-NYC but they're good nonetheless. I can't tell you for sure which one is the best in Chinatown. They're all pretty much the same to me. The best I've had is Ding Tai Fung in Taiwan. The XLB are good here but I pass on it ALL the time because of the wait and when you actually get seated, its noisy and cramped. And trust me, I'm no food divo, I can care less but something about Joe's is really whatever to me. Despite this lackluster review for Joe's. I'd still recommend that you try it at least once or twice, just so you can compare it with the others. People will have their favorites for their own reasons. But there is no stand out, definitive best XLB join in NYC. If you think there is then you don't know XLBs. Truth."
I like the duck banh mi at this place. Don't go during lunch time however cause you will be waiting forever. There is only maybe 15-20 seats in the restaurant.
"THE BEST empanadas in NY! Even though the location is a bit random, i drive out here just for the food. Its really good quality and unbelievably affordable. They also have a variety of options. Love this place!"
"I waited for two hours, was bitched at by our hostess, and was told what to order by our waitress. Was it worth the hype? Not really. Whatever. I'd probably go back."
"Love the pizza, love the happy hour specials, and love the service - with one exception. The hostess (tall, skinny, blondish woman) always comes off as standoffish and rude. I'm not sure what her job is other than to act pretentious. She is so rude, that if the pizza weren't so good, I would never ever come here again."
great sandwiches especially if you are in a hurry. fast and priced right. Â i always seem to leave wishing i ordered more. beware the line outside(summertime) buy two no credit cards .bring cash
"Go there for drinks and go before it gets crowded! Â Fantastic! Â  The food is not that great, but the drinks are amazing!"
"A nice meal with fresh oyster, tuna and salmon!"
"I love this place. Â When you get lunch, they always throw in a bunch of free crap, and I'm super-cheap, so I like that. Â The food is great, despite the opinion of some reviewers here. Â Me likey."
This place needs better service but the food is great.
"It's a great place to go for anyone who loves the unique taste of Korean food. The food is very healthy I guess, since they have lots of veggies and stuff all over. Â Great service, great food too. And the prices aren't too high, that's why it's highly recommended by me, and many other people too."
3.5 stars.
"if you like hot sauce so hot you blow steam out your ear canals, then this is the place for you. Mmmm, lamb and hot sauce. The perfect combo."
"MMMM so yummy! I came here around 10:30/11 on a Saturday night...we got the caesar salad, so delicious, lots of yummy bread, we got calamari and mushroom tortellini with truffle oil. So delicious. The wait staff was very friendly and did not try to push us out even though it was late and we were the only ones in the restaurant. The sangria is amazing too. It is reasonably priced and the food is great. Interior - seats and tables could use a make over."
"This is a small neighborhood spot, but the food is great, and the service was impeccable. Seriously. I went with two friends, and we sat at the bar to eat. Every staff member I saw in there seemed to be working together to make sure you were never without water/tea/coffee/whatever else you had ordered, and they were able to do it without being annoying or intrusive in the slightest. That is impressive to me."
Great place
Best pizza in NYC!
"I tried it the first time recently and I really liked it. Service, ambiance etc were fine. I ordered Guay Tiew Tom Yum with papaya salad. Very very good! Very flavorful and not too salty."
"Don't miss this excellent italian restaurant if you are in town. Located in a post industrial building with redbrickstone, simple decor and glass see through kitchen, this place is a must be. Menu is rich and full of options and changes periodically. We had as a starter the green salad with a sort of feta cheese and oil and lemon temper...simply to die for. Pasta dishes are spectacular. Carbonara was just perfect. Well cooked al dente with the right amount of sauce and top quality tasty ingredients. Finally not to be missed their grilled chicken simple but excellent. Overall a special italian restaurant in Manhattan."
"Balthazar Restaurant and Bakery is amazing!!! Â  The mac and cheese is amazing and the french toast is to die for. Â The place is cozy and the wait staff is very attentive, polite, and friendly. Â They are very efficient. Â I love coming to this place for authentic french food, it just tastes so good. Â I highly recommend checking this place out.!"
"I am super annoyed with this place - I have never ate here and I was finally coming here to try this ramen place that I trekked all the way up here. Got there at 6 pm and J checked and said there was 3 people in front of us and we ONLY saw the dude come out ONCE to call out Jamie. It was then 7:30 pm and J went to check again and the dude with the curly hair pony tail advised that the name was already called and we lost our spot. J then advised I should go and speak to this dude, this dude avoided all eye contact with me and even pretended he was NOT the dude that was handling the wait list. I then asked the other Japanese dude with glasses, he said I should speak to the curly hair dude and the Spanish dude said the same thing - who the hell is this curly hair pony tail dude? Seriously, why is he calling all the shots? I went up to him and he still avoided all eye contact and I was letting him know we never heard our names. They then point to the sign and aggressively pointed out NO EXCEPTIONS. I can understand if we weren't present, but we have been standing at that stupid place for over an hour and half. I am sorry, I am not saying this dude didn't call out our names, but he definitely didn't scream out the name with his meek attitude. SUPER ANNOYED! This effin dude with the dumb ass clipboard seriously needs to get a new system."
We came in for brunch and were excited with the photos we have seen. Way overly salted !!! The burger was not eatable and let's not even talk about the fries. The scone was good. The beans salad was tiny and missing protein. We will not come back!!
Best falafel in the city!
"I came here to try out some Asian food that's not Korean or Japanese. I don't really remember what I ate, but I think it's quite palatable. It's not something you could quickly get used to if your diet usually consist of burgers and junk food though. This Cambodian Cuisine Torsu deserves my 5 stars. :D"
i had brunch there with a couple of friend last weekend. we drove by and noticed this spot and decided to go in. the food was excellent!! pastries were fresh and the BloodyMary exquisite! the service was really nice and the waitress helpful. i will absolutely go back when i am around.
"Perilla is a haute cuisine restaurant, whose chef has been on TV. Notwithstanding that, the food is often excellent at Perilla. We have been there several times. The menu changes with the seasons. One criticism is that it has a small menu, so sometimes the food combinations and choices which interest the chef, do not interest me. Sometimes there is only one or two menu choices which suit me. But the wife loves this place."
"This is a high end event restaurant, Â but when you go in, Â it's charming and although formal, Â it's not stilted. Â We went for my son's birthday and the food was delicious, Â the wine excellent (and the Â sommelier didn't sneer at me when I had to disclose that I like sweet white wines) and the portions reasonable. Â  We were feeling quite proud of ourselves but then came desserts. Â We definitely should not have ordered 3, Â as tiny cookies and chocolates came with the coffee, Â and they could have served as dessert by themselves, Â and they gave us an extra one 'from the chef' Â because it was my son's birthday and portion control went out the window and we ate every sweet morsel. Â It was over the top delicious. Â  I'd definitely go again!"
"Love love love this place! Worth any line you might encounter. Some of the best BBQ sauce I've tasted. I haven't had luck sitting outside bc it's crowded, but inside is still fun and the food tastes the same :)"
"This place would have been 5 stars except for two disappointing dishes. Cons first: - The octopus and kale salad didn't seem to work - the tough bitter kale and the slightly chewy octopus did not complement one another. Be prepared for a jaw workout if you're planning on getting this salad. - The scallop ceviche was not awful but certainly not great - the delicate flavor of the scallops was completely lost in the overly spicy toppings/sauce. Enough of the bad, onto the great: - Happy hour from open-7pm consisting of 6 oysters and a locally brewed craft beer for $12. We sat at the bar and our bartender was extremely helpful since we're oyster noobs. She patiently helped us pick out a nice spread of east and west coast oysters. It was interesting to be able to compare the difference between the two. - The fettuccine with clams is an incredibly simple dish but executed to perfection - great balance between white wine, garlic, fresh clams, and al dente pasta. It's large enough to share but you might want to get your own. Keeping in theme with the name, almost everything here is local, including the wine that we got which was delicious (who would have thought that good sauv blanc can come from New York!). The restaurant doesn't even have freezers - everything is that fresh. Â Pair that with an ever-changing menu and you've got a winner."
"The food on offer here is similar to what you'd expect from a Vietnamese Banh Mi, tasty meats and fresh salads inside a crusty piece of bread. The queue was long but fast moving, a good indicator that you're somewhere people come back to for more! I had the coleslaw on the side which is a good idea if you've got a bigger appetite as the sandwiches are fairly small and by themselves probably wouldn't be sufficient."
"Had a wonderful dinner here. Reservation was late on a Saturday night, and we were greeted warmly and seated promptly. Service was great; we had a nice recommendation for wine and the spacing of the courses was perfect. Server was attentive but not overbearing. I had the halibut and my date got the duck--both were delicious! We started with the cheese plate that was a special that day and it was a lovely way to begin our meal. The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect. Great for a date, and despite being crowded, not to loud to discourage actual conversation. Loved the decor and feel of the place too."
"It's really a hole in the wall, do not expect any interior at all. Best as a quick snack or a takeaway. The quality of food is amazing for this price."
"Such an amazing spot to go for brunch. The reviews about the French Toast are nothing but True! Sometimes there is a long line, but it is definitley worth it."
"as it states in my profile, if i was able to have one last meal before getting the electric chair, it would be lombardi's... Â the all white pizza is literally a slice of heaven, but so is just the regular cheese... Â  let me put it to you this way, after leaving the east coast to be implanted in the west, i have done it a couple times where i catch the red eye out, grab a couple of pies from lombardi's, inhale them, and then catch the red eye back to LA... Â insanity?? Â maybe, but once you have a lombardi's, you will understand..."
"Great place good food frieady staff, and over all a nice place. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes good food."
"Expected A LOT better. Â Food was good, but nothing extraordinary. Â Bad service. Period. (We got there early, so it wasn't THAT crowded.) Food would've tasted better if the service was better and if my husband wasn't constantly banged into by the staff & customers walking by. Not recommended if you're looking for a good, relaxing meal. If this restaurant were cheaper, it could be forgivable. We won't be back."

"Really tasty sandwiches. They run out quick though, so scurry early!"
"I was so excited for this place. Perhaps that's contributing to my low rating. I LOVE risotto, but this place just didn't match up. The risotto just wasn't that impressive, and the atmosphere was less than enjoyable. In my opinion, the place is to small to try to be a sit-down restaurant. Cut the tables in half and make it self-serve. I was wedged so tightly between people I didn't know that I could hardly eat. The service was lame, and the wait was long. I won't be gong back."
"Excellent Addition to New York . Â They have Two floors the Â downstairs is an old style whiskey Pub and upstairs is a hip cocktail bar . The food is above average Gastro style Pub Food . Devilled Eggs were great , so was there Vol Vent , Home made French Fries or Chips , Meatballs were good but Â came in a brown gravy which is different . Bartender making the cocktails was excellent from somewhere in Scotland but super nice guy . The Pub is just so warm and cozy . Will be back from More Cocktails ."
"16"" pizza is non-traditional Neapolitan pizzeria. Size of the pizza or taste doesn't match to beautifully designed antique atmosphere. I really liked the ambience not that much the pizza. Â  I would give 5 stars for ambience & atmosphere."
A small group of friends met for brunch here. The food was excellent and the staff was super friendly. Even though I had never been here before I was treated like I was one of the regulars.
"I tried the Kimchi flavor with chicken, it was just amazing!!! Food is served pretty fast and barmaids are nice! I will go back for sure!"
"I came here during the Restutant week , got the 3 course meal , I must say the food was very good both the appetizer and the main Dish were big . The desert was incredible too. Overall great experience."
"Truffles on everything! Â Smells so good when you walk in! Â Great place, good food and nice bartender on Sunday!!! Â Can be pricy, but at least you get nice craft beers!!!"
"Always go for the classic, #9 Monster, lemongrass chicken, or the pork. Can't go wrong with any of them. Super flavorful, nice pickled carrots and daikon, great sandwich sauce, and crisp fresh cucumbers. Try it with a sunny side egg cooked to your liking (runny, medium, well done). The sandwiches are so good that they are even better the day after absorbing all the sauce and flavors."
"Ive only been here once, but will be going back for more. The food is really good. I ordered the braised pork belly tacos and the crack n' cheese dish, which apparently isnt on the menu anymore. bummer. It was fried gnochi with this delicous melted cheese and bits of qulait smoked bacon crumbled all over. It was fantastic and disapponted to see its no longer on the menu."
"A great place to hang out. Loved their salad and pork belly sandwich! Service was a little slow, but they made up for it with good service. Would go back again to try other things in their menu!"
"I've been here several times and although the service can be slow, bad and bitchy at times, you go for the fun atmosphere at any time of night or day, as well as the pretty good reliable food. The mac and cheese is always a hit with my table. I like the mussels even though some other disagree with me (they are in a creamy sauce). The country fried steak is a good heart attack, the salads are all good and the white grape martini is phenom. I find the prices more than reasonable considering the location and decor. In my opinion, gaytastic. I give it a B+/A-"
my favorite pizza place in all of NYC. They have this white pie with proscuitto mushrooms and arugula that is amazing. Try the octopus salad and the shrimp penne too. mmmm. Don't forget to have them deliver a bottle of wine!
"Charming, bustling, cozy, neighborhood restaurant. The food is consistently delicious across the board. Wine list is great, drinks are great, desserts are great. Service is warm and inviting. The dining room had original art, but a homey feel to it. Just a very good, pleasant, warm dining experience."
"Burnt crap. I had their $8 pie at Madison Square Eats, it looks great but it was a burnt watery tasteless mess. Get's an extra star because the guys are friendly, but the quality control is non-existent apparently."
"I'm editing this review to a 1 star only. My husband cannot digest what he had. Besides, as we just left we saw and heard the waitress complaining to the manager because we didn't leave good tips. That is a but too much. Not eating well and being treated that way makes a star lost. __________ We are originally from Belgium, Brussels and Liege. And we are SO disappointed !! The croque monsieur is NOT a traditional one, we had to send the fries back are they were completely saggy AND the burger as the meat was totally overcooked (even the 2nd time). We have been for 7 years living in the U.S. and were impatient to try out a traditional Belgian spot. We will NOT be back. It's unfortunate. I don't recommend it and it is NOT a traditional Belgian cuisine place. Oh! I forgot ... The fries were not even served with mayonnaise. I had to ask for it. Really guys? You should know better."
Food is good and authentic thai cuisine. Parking is a bit dangerous ( break into cars) and they only accept cash. It's a quick cheap eat in a nice atmosphere.
"Sorry. Looked super cute. But after waiting 50 mins for a slice of cheese on a plate for $15, we gave up. Thanks for the comped wine, but seriously. Why does it take 25 mins for toasted sliced bread to accompany our cheese, and another 45 mins for hamachi (code for uncooked fish!)? Not our game baby. Not our game!"
"I consider myself a native New Yorker and everyone knows that there is nothing like New York Style Pizza. My girlfriend and a friend accompanied me to the pizza shop which is JUST A PIZZA SHOP. Don't expect to sit down or hang out because you really cant. I was a little shocked when I found out that it was $4.50 a slice and I had to run out to an ATM to get some cash because they don't take any form of plastic. But when I saw the slices I understood the price tag; they're huge! Â We grabbed 6 slices of their famed Spinach and Artichoke Pizza and headed home to dig in. It really is one of the best, if not the best, slice of pizza I've ever had and I was so satisfied after just one! I fought the second one down only because my taste buds kept saying yes louder than my stomach was saying no. My girlfriend couldn't finish her second slice so we handed it off to my roommate who could not believe how delicious it really was. 5 stars for the pizza!"
"The food is good, but not for the hassle of the wait and the hostess that is rather crappy. I showed up to put my name down, I asked if I can come back in an hour, she said no reservations. I said fine, let me know when my table is ready. So I left my name and number, and ask her to call when my table is ready, I'm having a drink a few doors away. After about 45 mins, not hearing from our host, me and my party (3 of us) showed up. She refused to acknowldge my name on the list, saying I wasn't there, that I didn't tell her my party was complete or not, and they don;t take reservations. I said leaving my name down and having a drink next door does not constitute reservations right? Why did she take my phone number? She refused, she said you have to wait more than one hour now. I said, ""that is not very nice"" and left."
"I have a love hate relationship with this place. Â I love the food and hate the waits. The list is very egalitarian but there should be a limit as to the number of seats per name - some pin head place his name down for ""18"" people???? I think this place only has 16 seats! The food is pretty good and it really inexpensive. Â We would eat here more often if we did not have to wait for a table. Â But then again, everyone would eat here more often it the waits were shorter. Â I think this place is on every food tour... The broth is fabulous (I would not like to be the person who has to stir the cauldron of stock all day, especially in the summer). Â I think the noodles are good - not fabulous."
"I like this bar a lot. Â My girlfriend and I had oysters and salads at the bar with gin cocktails. Â All yum. Â It's a bit expensive and the music was too loud, but it's thoughtful, cool and cozy. Â A good place to meet a friend."
"I noticed this place while sitting in traffic trying to get into the Holland tunnel. It is now my favorite place. Very small, understated, incredible incredible food. So simple and perfect. I always get the honey and soy chicken wing appetizer. Then its either the miso glazed salmon or anyone of the salads. The ginger tea is exceptional. Writing this makes me want to go there tomorrow. The staff is great. Always so pleasant."
"It was Wednesday night during the blizzard of 2010. Â I figured if I was ever going to try Di Fara without having to wait in line this would be the night. Â So I hopped on the Q train from Union Square and sat an interminable amount of time (""the train is delayed, please be patient- at least 20 times!) and finally got off at Avenue J. Â Sure enough, there were a few people hanging around, but I could walk right up and order 2 pies (there were 5 of us) and get enough chairs for most of us to sit down. The place is UGLY dirty- grime everywhere. Â You just have to be OK with that if you're going to eat from the god Domenico at the temple of Pizza Heaven. Thankfully, they have paper plates and napkins. Â But you also have to be OK with no bathrooms- even after a 45 minute subway ride (not cool!). Â  The oven is super fast (we got our pizzas in 10 minutes) and out comes this molten beauty with fresh basil strewn across the top like a flower girl throwing petals down the aisle at a wedding. Â I have to admit- I thought I was going to be disappointed- NOT SO! Â  Also, Domenico is not a god after all, unless the old guy I enjoyed chatting with is some sort of Avatar. Â Worth the trip!"
"So good! Â I've tried everything here, restaurant is however very small"
What??? $3 beers and bangin' burgers in the middle of Sex-in-the-City land??? Tell me I'm dreaming.
"Tried momo's for the first time here - my friend who is from Nepal really loved them and said they were pretty close to home, but I guess I'm just not a fan of them, however, I did love the sauce they served them with! I did love the chilli chicken we ordered, which is pretty close to what we get in India. Quick service, yummy food. If I was in the mood for momo's I would come back again - they were cooked well."
ok i guess......service was fair
"I can easy give a 4 stars , minus one for a long waiting time."
"I got a baguette roll, which was equally satisfying. The baguette was nice and crusty and the ham was tasty. I would come back for sure. Our petite French waitress was also charming and lovely. Expect reasonable prices here and a cosy little French bistro atmosphere."
Great food for a vegan restaurant. Enjoyed it.
"I've eaten in Thailand, New York, New Jersey and Virginia. This place is a popular one so I went to check it out to see what the hype was all about. Â This place has big space so it's great for groups. I've been to both locations. The service and food was consistent. The food wasn't what I expected as they do serve the typical thai dishes. I don't think I would come back as we have many Thai opinions in NYC."
"Update: MELON WATER!!! Was in the neighborhood last week, so I had to get my fix. Chorizo quesedilla . Perfect as usual. My lunch date was also thoroughly impressed, which meant a lot as he spends all of his spare time traveling the world to eat the best food. This is my new trick...I convince people with cars that I have found the best tacos in New York and if they drive me over there, I will buy them some. It's a good thing I am right. Anyway, while I was waiting for them to bag up my order, the counter guy gave me a free sample of their melon water to try. It was exquisite! Seriously, the most perfectly sweet but not too sweet summer drink. BYO vodka to mix with it and you will be in heaven...or at least my idea of heaven."
"This place is solid. The food is on point and the decor is clean, simple, and adorable. The atmosphere is pretty nice as well, with the theme very much feeling like a actual Japanese room. The service was not bad. Could have been a little more expedient, but nothing worthy of a real complaint."
"I have been to several Italian restaurants in New York and this definitively the best one. It has a small menu but I tried 4 different plates and they were all delicious and totally different and unique. The portions are perfect small sized how an Italian restaurant should've, with a three course meal it's more than enough. The service was perfect as well. I totally recommend this it's a different but truly Italian restaurant."
Way too many tables in a small space to adequately enjoy what is just mediocre Italian fare.
"What in the hell do they put in the fish here? Â If Red Bull had traces of cocaine in it, then this stuff has CRACK in it. Â There is nothing I can say other than this place serves up some of the best sushi I've had in the city. Â And for little money, I think it's completely worth it."
"The translation of Fette Sau means ""fat pig"" and that's exactly what I feel like every time I leave here. The smell when you walk in is just amazing. You can tell the meat has been cooking for days. I personally go for the sausage, baked beans!! (with chunks of tender meat), and brisket. I find the other meats to be a little fatty sometimes but hey that's just me. There are about 5 different BBQ sauces to choose from as well. The beer and whiskey selection is just fantastic. A lot of the beer is actually brewed in BK. To avoid lines get there early. They open at 5. Picnic tables are outside year round too."
"Vibe- NYC Cowboy BBQ Price- astronomical Service- Cafeteria style Greeting- none Table bread- plastic bag rolls Food: Brisket is amazing Berkshire pork ribs are excellent beef ribs are dry Shredded pork is dry Beans burnt ends are excellent Sausage is forgettable Potato salad is not good WIGB? Only if you are buying. I have to say this is some of the best BBQ I have ever eaten. But the prices are so high for what we ate. We could have gone to Per Se with the price we were charged for what we ate. I thought a mistake was made when we got the billl. Everything here is by the pound. Those heavy bones add up fast. The food is the best, but not worth the price. Hard call, but someone has to call it like it is. If a Texan ate here and saw the bill he would laugh at us yankees!"
"5 dumplings for $1.00, need I say more? The dumplings are always fried to perfection, never ever too crispy. Sesame pancake with beef is SUPER filling and it's only $1.50. Seriously, everything here is like under $2.00. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order. The soups are pretty good as well, a little better than your average take out place but not really something I have often in general. Only bad thing is that this place is super cramped but it's not really a place to stay and eat."
"What a great place. Awesome food. Been here a couple of times for brunch. Deviled eggs, lemon ricotta pancakes, burger, shoestring fries, pork cheek on toast. All amazing. The only drawback is sometimes there are empty tables during brunch, but they still make you wait a few minutes. I'm guessing to stagger the kitchen, or the front of house is incompetent. There were 3 people manning the front of house station. Haven't figured that one out yet."
"The food is really really good...I am still dreaming about the perfect matches of their different cheeses with almonds or dried fruits, or the octopus with potatoes that melts in your mouth...we picked five different tapas for the two of us and we like everything!! The place is tiny, so if you can, make a reservation. the service vas very nice too. We had a really good experience there!"
"One of the better dining optioins in Brooklyn Heights, and a tremendous drink menu. Â Some of the dishes can be hit or miss, and the bloody mary with the pork is horrible, but for the most part I've enjoyed my meals here. Â Very quaint location."
Great wines and food. Â The wine menu is like a book. Â Very helpful in picking the right wine for you. Â Very educated staff. facebook.com/In.NYC
Guilt free pizza. Â So thin and so tasty!
"I love this place. Decor is timeless, wooden, high ceilings wood paneling, ( a little cozy) but very Parisian feeling. Great kale salad, brunch menu is awesome. In the spring/summer months try to get a seat outside. Great view of all of the lovely hip inhabitants of greenpoint. I'd recommend this place to anyone."
love this place.......pasta is out of this world......
"This is probably one of the most authentic cuban cafes you will ever try in Manhattan. It's one of my favorite spots for brunches and dinner, waiters are Â friendly, drinks are awsome, mojitos are great there, but most importantly are the grilled corn with cheese and butter, and the cuban sandwich is the best."
"This place lives up to its award of best pizza in New York by Zagat. The pizza here is really really good. It is awesome that they offer vegan pizzas. My friend is a vegan so it couldn't be more perfect dining here. We got the Ricotta Da Vegan with basil. It is so good and clearly not enough between the who of us. The service was impeccable, the servers were very attentive to our table. Paulie also made his way to our table to make sure everything is up to par. This made us feel special, and of course everything was great. The price is reasonable for NYC. I would come back for sure."
"I know, I know. Â How can I give the Grammery Tavern 2 stars? Â Well, reservations were easy. Â Got there a few minutes early. Front desk was a tad snooty and aloof, but coat check was efficient. Â The bartenders seemed harried and were a tad curt with us as the result. G_d forbid we move to the two available stools, they are being held for others who I guess have been waiting. They didn't however show for 10 more minutes at which point we politely moved away. Â We had our mediocre California cabs and the bill was efficiently transferred to our waiting table which was nice. Â We forgot about th table and nobody from the hostess station bothered to alert us so we were seated about a half hour late and were hastily scolded for our tardiness! Ice water is served. Â Beverage order is requested almost immediately, and since we wanted wine, the waiter made a couple selections. The first couple suggestions were both over $300 per bottle, and we finally settled on a bottle that was $85, good for those on a budget according to Marcello (our waiter). Â  Appetizers were squid ink spaghetti and smoked trout, both of which were ""meh"". Â The bread was either sourdough or a roll. Cold, but OK. Â Butter was the exact perfect temperature which is always a plus. Wine service was attentive. Â Glasses always filled evenly and timely so they def had enough staff on the floor to not miss a beat, but then again, the restaurant was only half full this early in the evening. It did fill up later. No steak on the menu. Boo. Real disappointment not being able to get a steak at a tavern. Â They seemed to lean heavily toward fish and vegetarian items, and neither of us wanted those. So, there was a poached chicken dish and a lamb. Â Neither of these dishes was bad; they were, rather, boring. Uninspired. The wine wasn't great. I've purchased bottles at the store for $8 that were as good or better. I think they could tell we were a little disappointed, or they knew that the food has fallen on tough times since Shake Shack has become the obsession of their famous owner, so they overcompensated with desserts. Â Chocolate mousse, chocolate and passion-fruit trifle were amazing. I rarely go for dessert, and I rarely eat a lot when I do, but these were fantastic and Â I ate everything in sight! So, why only 2 stars? Â For Almost $400, the ambiance is OK, but not exciting in any way, and the food just isn't all that great. For the money, I recommend you look elsewhere and the restaurant should stop resting on it's laurels."
"great cuban food for a tiny ""hole-in-the-wall"" place. Â I was told to try the chicken soup, which wasn't great but the Cuban sandwich was really good."
"This place was excellent! Our server Thibaut was great, very attentive. The food was perfect, and they have by far, the best waffles I've ever had in my life! I was prepared for fussy and overpriced French food. It was anything but. Amazing comfort breakfast food that will fill you up for the day. Cocotte is superb with the potatoes to die for Service was generally good, although it was rather busy, so refills on water and waiting for the check was on the slower side. Not too pricey, but certainly could go cheaper too. I would come back in a heartbeat for breakfast of lunch if I'm in the area."
"So yeah, I'm a BIG FAN. First off, 2nd avenue is kind of my steez and it took my friend and me about 2 minutes to walk here sooooo no brainer. I made our reservations via Open Table and made a specific request for a corner booth/table that is a little quiet. We arrived about 18 minutes early to which they told us that they were working on my request. Once 8pm arrived (our reservation time) the front of the house manager came to us and said that he didn't want us to wait any longer for ""that table"" that he had in mind. It was refreshing that for once a restaurant actually read my Open Table request. Â Nicely done! The restaurant was smaller than we expected. We sat in the back area at a two-top against the wall. Nice ambiance. Perfect place for a nice date night except for one thing - it can be a tad loud. This was our first time here so maybe it was more of the people sitting around us, but at times during the beginning of our dining experience, we were almost in a yelling match trying to hear each other. We ordered a bottle of wine which may have helped...After we each downed a glass, we were able to drown out most of the other conversation. **Our server MATT(?) was awesome. Very attentive yet not overcrowding. THE FOOD: Simply delicious. Everything was served in more than fair portions and both my friend and I had ""I can't stuff anymore food down my throat"" boxes once we left. Anyway... GRILLED CALAMARI - outstanding. I would hop on two trains and a bus to come here for it. I don't even know if words will do it justice. JUST ORDER IT! Your taste buds will thank you! ENTREES - Linguini and clams and gnocchi. Both of which were spectacular however one thing about the gnocchi. It's covered with pesto. I mean a LOT of pesto. My husband who is a loves pesto even said it was too much for him. All the pasta is fresh made here BTW. DESSERT - tiramisu. ORDER IT. So good. Pair it with an espresso or cappuccino. TIP: must order the GRILLED CALAMARI and have reservations."
"My favorite pizza in the city. As far as sit down places, it's better than Grimaldi's...better than Lombardi's...better than Arturo's...better than...well..anywhere else! The crust is super thin and perfectly crispy. The sauce is perfect. If you are getting delivery, definitely go with a plain pie. The crust is really, really thin and gets soggy under the weight of toppings during delivery. #1 on my list of pizza of any kind. In the city. In the state. In the country. In the world!"
"I went there during Restaurant Week. What i found amazing is not only the food, but also the beautiful clients there. It's a fabulous spot in lower east side.:)"
Second best eggs benny in the city that i have had. Â The brunch crowd is large but usually don't have to wait too long. Â The service is hit or miss. Â They definitely want to get em in get em out.
"i went for the first time about 1 year and a half ago and I loved it. then I started to go pretty often until the quality of the food and the service went down. The staff is not friendly at all, and the pizza...good but Â small and expensive. I found a few other place where i can eat my pizza napoletana!"
This place is good and I love anna screaming my name when I get there...She's from Roma and she loves Pizza Roma like me
"If you want to eat here....do NOT go for pre theater.....and if you do....MAKE A RESERVATION! This place is ALWAYS packed from 5-8pm....but for good reason. Who thought you could find good Italian in midtown? They have an AWEOME wine list on the back of the menu and every bottle is $25.00. I personally love to sit at the bar in the back, the service is always good. Get the pasta tasting....it's 3 unlimited pastas, but they are always AMAZING. I would consider living in that awful neighborhood just so I could have an excuse to eat at Becco more often!"
"Had a great meal here last week with a friend. Â Ordered two arepas and their pabellÃ³n criollo with carne mechada to share... I don't usually like beef, but this was incredible. Â I'm definitely going back! ps - we managed to walk in on a Friday night at 7:30p but by the time we left around 9p they were incredibly crowded with reserved tables."
I ate the other day at Cafeteria and I loved the mc n cheese. I didn't like that much the salad that I had. Alright overall.
You go here for the fries and the endless number of dipping sauces. The guy at the counter was great. He let us sample a lot of the sauces before we chose. The serving sizes are large. 2 of us shared the smallest size and for a snack it was perfect. Favorite sauce was the garlic rosemary
"My parents took me here because I can't afford it. Â Everything we had was so so so good. Â They told me that the chef ( mr. conant) is a pretty big name chef in the city. Â now I know why!!! Â This is one of the restaurants that was voted by Esquire mag. to be one of the best in the country this year. Â Top 20 restaurant, my dad told me. Â The braised short ribs, the homemade pastas with squid ink... Â All so good. Â Gonna make my parents take me there again!! Â I think I love to eat. Â My dad told me that we are going to try all the restaurant that was on the list of Esquire in NYC. Â I think there was four of them. Â Can't wait!!"
"One of my favorite lebanese/mediterranean restaurants! Service of course was efficient and courteous. Wine selections is great. Food was AMAZING! From the falafel, to the hummus, to all the yummy desserts.... I love ilililililililillililiiiiii!!!!!"
You gotta have the crab BLT with avocado. It's sufreakingpurb. All the parts come together perfectly with the bread and $2 sides. I'm tempted to get one of their crab taco sauces in it next time like the lemon aoli or wasabi mayo. Nice owner Fifi and good chowder and buttery crab rolls too. Already naming the next visit.
"Diner is a perennial favorite. Â The front dining room makes you feel like you're in a railcar: Â intimate without being suffocating. Â From the handcut tiles to the custom light fixtures, this places has an exceptional design. Â I have had many great dinners at diner, but the most memorable are about the fish."
This is great japanese food. For a fun meal sit at the bar and you will see the chefs like ninjas jumping from one end to the other and handing you your food with a long spatula. Everything grilled to perfection but keep in mind portions are very small so you keep ordering then you end up surprised with a large bill.
Absolutely delicious and fresh empanadas. Try the spicy chicken and the Brasil. Also the natural fruit shakes and the amazing dessert empanadas - my favorite is the one called Romeo and Juliet. Service is friendly although the place is often very crowded. Quintessentially New York! Love it!
"it's good- drinks ae great, solid italian food- pretty small menu, but solid."
"Quick, delicious, reasonably priced. Â Good healthy alternative to fast food. Â Will be back next time I'm in the area."
"The pizza was really good here.Gooey cheeze, amazing sauce, and really good crust. Good, prompt service, once you finally get in the door. The wait can get a little ridiculous, so I would try to go on weekday to avoid the line around the block."
"The menu is very large and most of the items we have tested were delicious. Ginger mojito was excellent. Our favorite dishes were Dates, Paella, bass tartare if you like ceviche, brussel sprouts and hanger steak. When we asked for jamon and other typical tapas dishes, our waiter told us that this is not a tapas restaurant but a small plate Mediterranean restaurant. The deserts were excellent too. Highly recommend pot de creme and chocolate lave cake. We were seated on the first floor where there is a great wood fire place. The second floor had windows overlooking backyard and looked very nice too. Since you end up ordering so many dishes, it can get expensive."
Saw patrons at the bar being harassed and then physically attacked while the bar staff did next to nothing to stop it. Get some security.
"one of my favorite restaurants in the city. the food is fresh and beautifully prepared and presented. i just went again over the weekend and was amazed after sampling some dishes i hadn't yet tried, including the fantastic kakuni. i also love their soba."
"mmm...cooorn...mmm... Just thinking about it is making me crave it. Â I absolutely love this place. Â If you still havent tried the corn, what are you waiting for!! Â I suggest you go and get some now."
"I've been wanting to check out this restaurant for a while based on all the raves, and I'm so glad I was finally able to. Â We got an earlier reservation on a Sunday based on the fact that prime time reservations usually get filled pretty quickly. Â When we arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty, but by the time we were leaving, it was packed! Â Despite this, however, the waiter was very attentive and did not have any problems answering all our questions about the meal and offering us suggestions. Â Everything we ordered was delicious, and the ricotta app special was especially good. Â Portions were small, but sufficient - although it matches the prices and the multi-course menu style. Â I will most likely come back soon... if anything it's a good place to recommend to friends."
Great Greek food! And great value!
"Outside of finding it, the restaurant doesn't have a drawback. There's no sign in front and just a few lights in the entry window, actually below the street level. Once inside though, it's a top ten restaurant in this city. The sangria is extraordinary. Don't miss the broccollini, the giant shrimp, and the fried goat cheese. The two story interior is comfortable and warm....a delightful space. Service was good. It's a very busy place so good for a group of friends."
"No one knows pizza like me. My friends from back in the old Brooklyn neighborhood call me ""The Pizza Gourmand."" Artichoke Basille is the best pizza by the slice around. I like the more traditional margharita pizza, but the Artichoke/Spinach is incredible (my wife's absolute favorite). Unfortunately, I haven't tried their crab pizza because I am Kosher. However, it looks and smells amazing. Well, perfection just got even better. You must try their new Sicilian (square) pizza called ""Sicillian a la Vodka."" Wow--what a fabulous creation. Their traditional Sicillian is great, but this gourmet masterpiece is even better. The East 14th location is just like a real, old fashioned pizza place. Small, no tables and always crowded. You have to wait for a spot by the side counter just to stand and eat your little piece of heaven--but it's worth it. For a pizza orgasm, try this unique pizza joint."
"A hidden gem, in the sense that the rest of the places in the vicinity of Times Square are basically shitholes. The pastas here are great, from the simple (penne arrabiata) to the special (squid ink raviolo stuffed with seafood). Also a good wine list and excellent service. The waiters here are friendly and professional, not stuffy at all but still extremely polished. They know the menu inside and out, so don't be afraid to ask for recommendations! The food is really excellent for the price, especially considering the touristy location. Pretty much the only place I'll consider dinner in the area."
One of the best Kale salads in America (outside of my kitchen). A little pricey though.
"I ordered two eggs on a roll with ham and cheese, and it was hard to beat for $4. Â Coffee came with my sandwich also."
Miss this place. Late night. cheap. crowded but fast and yums. Do it
"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in NYC. The place itself is cozy and decorated like a regal dining room in the countryside. The service is always prompt and attentive enough without being too overbearing. Our favorite dishes are the roasted chicken (melts in your mouth! you'll be surprised just how tender the chicken is), garganelli (can never go wrong with this choice) and the bucatini. Sitting upstairs is the best especially if you have a larger party."
One of my favorite places to eat. Really cozy and nice. I enjoy a lot an ambience. Music is always good. I take many times my friends out to eat at this place and food is same quality
"This is the coziest restaurant on the east side. Not really the place for a whole meal, but more for appetizers or one of their delicious pizzas. Amazing wine list and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the selection they offered. I will be back for certain."
Don't understand the hype or long lines. Â My food was average. Â My bacon was greasy and floating in oil. Â The atmosphere is nice but I won't go back. Â Had been wanting to go for a long and was not impressed.
"Amazing meal. Tasting menu and butter poached lobster were great. The dining room is beautifully redone, with a Â modern setting to complement the affluent crowd it serves. The drink selection is vast and creative, with something for every taste. For a stronger choice, the Mackenzie Manhattan was simple and robust. For a sweeter palate, the cucumber mint Hendricks martini still packed a punch and was a crowd pleaser. Overall, Perry St definitely lived up to its reputation and would highly recommend!!"
"Great food, service and ambiance. A little noisy, but that is the price you have to pay to eat at this joint!"
"Not so many people. Quiet. Food, (We had Lamb and Steak) amazing. Ginger juice, very good. Nice servers. The only thing is that the first drink (asked to make it light) tasted like flavored water. That's the only thing. Wonderful restaurant. Must go!"
"Why? Why? Why every g#^@$#mn restaurant in this city that has great food has to screw it up after its 13th or 14th month. I want to keep coming here guys I want to give you my money, but I guess you think you made enough already :( Terrible!!"
"Nice selection, chill vibe, solid food. . . and all at the right price. Â Seating is not the most comfortable."
"Wife and I went for the two day Pig Roast and Clam Bake last year. Last year we BOTH ordered Pig Roast and enjoyed it. We eagerly awaited this year's event. This year Saturday wife had Clam Bake and she absolutely LOVED it. I had Pig Roast and Â liked it. Wait staff was very pleasant. We enjoyed their hard cider. I had thought that maybe we would go again Sunday and maybe switch dishes, but music was too loud so won't do that. We actually had to RAISE our voices to talk to each other at the table. I may be tempted to go for brunch, but a good idea may be to call on phone to get an idea of music loudness before going. They lose one star because of loud music, sounded like a disco."
"They had this ginger lemonade drink that so good. Â Didn't try the falafel, but will be back for that since I saw some of them and want to see more!"
"A massive food hall that has a little bit of everything. I come in here when I need a quick bite of something special. My fave is the fresh mozzarella cheese which will cost you $20 for the lump! Yes, you read that right. They call it city prices, Hello, I wasn't buying real estate but it's good. Next you have tons of fresh veggies and fruits laid out in colorful displays. If you want to take a step into Italy, grab and expensive coffee. I suggest the Eataly. Grab licorice from Italy or a gift that you need for that person who has everything. Tons of cook books and accessories are here as well. Walk amongst the crowd and enjoy."
"Great food, strong drinks, and good customer service. What more can you ask for? First impression not so friendly welcome from what I believe is the manager. Sat my date and I down after finishing a convo with the bartender and gave us ONE menu. VERY strong mojito with tons of mint and a fairly good frozen margarita. I went for the platano relleno and the date got the grilled steak burrito. Waitress didn't ask if we wanted yucca fries (should be standard) and gave us regular potato fries. I asked for yucca fries replacement and instead of taking it in to spit in our burrito (haha), they kindly just gave us a fresh side order instead. Platano relleno was amazing, perfectly cooked and seasoned pulled pork with great sauce topping that blended perfectly with the plantain. Date's steak was juicy and the guacamole topping was good as well. Yucca fries is a MUST HAVE. That chimichurri sauce goes together so well with it. Definitely going back for the carnitas por dos & brunch."
"The food here is exceptional. Â I haven't had pasta this good in ages. Â We had STRACCI wide ribbon pasta, braised porcini mushrooms and CAPPELLETTI truffled mascarpone ravioli, melted butter, prosciutto. Â The cappelletti were delicious, but the showstopper is the stracci. Â The feel of Osteeria Morini is casual and rustic, and the food has simple elements prepared perfectly. Â We also had a delicious salad and wonderful desserts. Â It is a popular spot and crowded so it can be a bit noisy. Â The only downsize was the service is not impressive and the hosts were not friendly. Without reservation, the wait can be an hour. Was this review ...?"
"This is my first review on Yelp, but unfortunately there are NO ACCOLADES for Ippudo. Â I would award them 0 stars, but Yelp doesn't give me that option. Â I've been coming here for ramen, since I moved to NY about 2 years ago; While I do admit enjoying Ippudo's ramen (esp. Akamaru Modern), I can't go back out of principle. Â yesterday, I abruptly left the restaurant when management decided to slap me with a surcharge of $4/person for eating a cupcake in their restaurant. Â No one gave me a warning, but they just automatically added the ridiculous surcharge to my tab. Â I went late in the afternoon, and did not have to wait for a table, but for some reason, things were EXTREMELY SLOW in the kitchen. Â I mean, come on, it should take 5 minutes to bring out a bowl of ramen. Â I was STARVING and the only thing to stave off my hunger were the cupcakes that I bought from Butter Lane. Â I asked if, instead, I could order an appetizer or drinks, but they didn't even give me the option. Â Moreover, I think it's annoying when this ""policy"" was not listed anywhere on the menu. Â The manager on duty said management is allowed to do whatever they please, but shouldn't they, instead, try to please the customers? Â Afterall, you are paying $15 for a bowl of peasant food. Â So fellow YELPERS, beware! Oh and if you want amazing pork buns, head over to Momofuku Milk Bar and get some to go. Â They are simply delightful, delectable treats that aren't measly in size compared to Ippudo's."
"Ramen-Ya in West Village is my favorite place to eat. Their broth is much creamier and tastier than IPPUDO and TOTTO Ramen ! Ramen-Ya is a new restaurant that has a great atmosphere albeit rather small in space. My favorite is their tender and flavorful CHASHU also knows as Grilled Pork). I went to Ramen-Ya last week, I tried their new ramen called the ABURA-SOBA. it is a unique creation of ramen with no soup! They have 2 kinds, one spicy and another is their traditional flavor. The traditional version uses a Kakushi-Aji, whick means ""seacret ingredient"" in Japanese. This is a Ramen-Ya original and never seen before in NYC!"
Good selection of brunch with a middle eastern twist. Cosy cafe which is relaxed and we were not rushed. Only downside is that the green tea smelled and tasted like old tyres-so bad it was undrinkable. Rest of food was good.
Enjoyed dinner. Â nice atmosphere.good service. food alittle mundane. good for in the hood
"I took a friend here for birthday brunch last weekend and it was delicious! Â We started off with the bread basket and each got our own entrees, breakfast poutine and ratatouille. Â (Full review here: aspiringgastrognome.blogâ€¦) The ambience was cozy and the server was patient and friendly. Â Definitely a place to hit up again, maybe for dinner next time."
"I was looking for the best restaurant in New York to have a special Christmas Eve dinner with our friends and i found it at Juni. I had the pleasure of going here on our first night in New York. The restaurant was definitely an upscale dining experience. The restaurant seating is well spaced out so it feels very intimate. The menu is a bit difficult to read, but luckily the server was good at translating into a more understandable format. The dishes ranged from excellent to truly outstanding. The restaurant clearly put in every effort to create dishes that went above and beyond in creativity and flavor. We chose the 4 course menu and each course was beautifully put together and tasted fantastic. My favorite was a black ball filled with potato and truffle. Simple taste but beautiful and pure. Also, the wine list is large and varied. Needless to say, i would highly recommend this place."
"delicious - savory soup, nicely cooked noodle with proper texture - the pork melts in your mouth."
"Comparable to any of the best steak places - at an amazing price. Â Beautiful meat, perfectly cooked. Â Great sides. Â And an awesome little bar tacked on the side for a pre dinner drink. Â Get there early - lines around the block"
"Really good brunch spot. For a protein boost, the ham comes as a huge steak-like slab. And nothing beats green eggs."
"Congratulations to these guys, they just opened up a gem in the LES!!!!!!! The place is really cool, their pizza is made with organic flour, the rest of the menu is a variety of great Italian dishes, everything again is organic. The quality of food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable, what impressed me the most it was the energy of the place, very unique, you feel at home from the moment you stepped in. We had the tuna tartar and two pizzas, one it was with robiola cheese the other one with prosciutto di Parma. I can't wait to go back and try more. Bravo!!!!"
"It never gets old. I live around the corner and have meatballs maybe three times a week. A lot of great restaurants I find I feel very enthusiastically about at first, but continually visiting takes away the value, however the meatball shop is consistently amazing. Maybe its because the concept is so simple, and yet there is so much variety. Whatever it is, it certainly works for me (i wait like a hawk at the bar ready to swoop down and grab seats so as not to wait for an hour!)."
artichoke dip and french dip are my favvies
"Good varied menu of organic vegan food. The portobello mushroom sandwich was terrific, as was the Buffalo ""chicken"" sandwich and the beet salad. Highlight of the meal was the Chocolate Peanut Butter shake that we shared, completely delicious and dairy free. I would go back just for that! Good location. One drawback, not enough seating! Super friendly staff. Would eat at again for sure!"
"For drinks only: Happy hour drinks are great. They took a while once, but the drinks made up for the wait. -1 star because the place is always empty when I go and it's a little bit of a mood-killer."
"C: Friday night dinner with D before hitting up the club. Did not have reservation but didn't have to wait too long for seats. We were seated on the high stool area? by the bar. Struggled a bit getting on and off the seat being 5'2'' lol. Ordered the whole wheat pizza with mushrooms, pamesan, oregano, and egg. Pure delicious-ness! I'm a hugeeee pizza fan. The pizza was slightly crispy with the perfect texture. The egg was perfectly cooked where the yolk was still a little runny. Soaked it all up with the pizza crust. YUM. Service was okay. The waiter was a little turned off when D and I said we didn't want any wine? Took them a while to fill our water too! Liked the place but don't think I'm dying to go back. D: I've been here a few times and I think ABC Kitchen has a great mix of ambiance and food. Â It's not so packed that you couldn't go there on a whim without reservations, even on a Friday night. Â The decor of the place is nice, not so loud that you couldn't carry a conversation and not so quiet that you can hear forks drop. Â Though I think this place is more known for its pizzas, I got the homemade ricotta ravioli with herb and tomato sauces. Â Definitely a good choice and C's pizza that I stole parts of was just as delicious. Â That being said, the waiter seemed a bit put off when we didn't order drinks with our meal, but I think that was a one-off incident. Â Overall, I would recommend this place."
"The decor is modern as the Rchard Meirs builing that houses it, as is the cuisine. Had their fried chicken and it was sublime. My sashimi appetizer was excellent; fresh and tagny. The servie was as attentive to detail as the decor and the food. Most memorable of all was the rhubarb and lychee trifle which was unbelievably good - sadly a Special for only another week or so as apparently the chef insists on the freshest market ingredients. The service was also very good in this lovely modern restaurant with views of the Hudson. Not cheap but absolutely good value for the quality."
Not worth the money ...the food at the restaurant was bad.
"Ok people, if you live in New York City and you have not eaten at Bianca's, you need to GET ON THAT. ASAP. This restaurant is everything you could ever want - FAST (and I do mean FAAAAAAST) service, GREAT ambiance, PHENOMINAL FOOD (I'm sure they sprinkle crack in it), and wait, wait, it gets better - CHEAP! Wtf you say? Cheap!? I know, you're thinking, ""Ok bromana montana, define 'cheap.'"" There is one item on the menu, I believe a beef dish and it's $14.50. ONE ITEM. Everything else on the menu is between 10-12 dollars for large, delicious portions of food. My favorite thing to get is the lasagna, $13. I hate lasagna, I really do, but someone recommended that I try this dish at Bianca's and on a date, I was like, ""Ok Max make a quick decision because you haven't read the menu."" Got the lasagna and honestly, best decision ever. To my ladies, if you're going on a date, recommend this place to who ever the strapping young lad is who is going to pay for you. You won't be disappointed. Infact, you'll probably want to go on another date with him simply because you had such a great time at the restaurant, not because the potential suitor was cool or anything. To my men - do you want a second date with a girl? Take her here for the first one. You can get 2 entrees, A BOTTLE of wine (I recommend the Albana, white wine, $24 - it's amazing) and desert for a little over $50 dollars. Yes, I'm dead serious. It's dimly lit, cozy, and warm - everything you could ask for. However, you need to get there early, as this place does not take reservations, and it fills up fast because like I said earlier, they sprinkle crack in the food, and the people gotta have their fix, ya diiiiiiiiiig. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed."
"I LOVE this place looks like a hall in the wall very authentic, food is GREAT, great Value don't go there on your first date she will know you are cheap (but will enjoy the food a lot). another advantage is they are sharing the wall with with another great ramen noodle place in case they are full (you can't beat that ha?) they have some dishes they serve half size (good for kids ;))"
"so much hype but doesn't deliver. No where near a 3 star experience, had the black label burger, it was very good but over priced compared to a comparable high end burger. Â The bone marrow was kinda flat blue ribbons marrow much better I will end up skipping this one next time."
The pork buns are as necessary as a stop in central park. The food is great and the service even better. I am always overwhelmed with dinner options in New York but now I have my one go to spot. I tried so many dishes but there was nothing like the pork buns. I came with a lot of friends and thought it was going to be difficult to get a large table. Even though they were packed they were very helpful and prompt in getting us in.
Went with a party of about 12 for a birthday - everyone was happy with their meal. Good Stuff!
"Great place, far from cheap"
"Yummmmmmmmmm! Late nite happiness. SOme of these fries with that Pesto Mayo, made my nite!"
The place was very nice inside. Â  Service was good to average. Â  Food was good but not amazing or that memorable. Â Best thing we had was the octopus and branzino but the carrots that came with the branzino was an after thought and were HORRIBLE! Â Mayo with carrots? Â  WHAAAAT?
It was highly recommended by a friend to check out this cozy little spot. So 3 friends and I braved the rain and made it here on a Friday night at 8:00pm. The food is yummy and so were the drinks. The sangria was strong and yummy but just note that it is not done the traditional way with red wine. 3 stars --Downside was that we kept getting rushed by the servers if we were done like every 5-10 mins ever since they saw that our plate was 50% done. I understand tables need to swish in & swish out given that it's a Friday night but it is still such a bummer when you look so forward to coming here to relax Â and enjoy a meal with your buddies and instead you get interrupted half the time during your meal.
"DId not blow me away. It was good. But that's it. At their prices, with their swagger, I should have been blown away. Go. Don't go. Doesn't matter."
"Forget the haters. This is simply the best pizza on the planet. I've been all over (not to Bianco in AZ yet, but soon.) - The Level of ingredients used and the care put into each pie - these are the two things that put Di Fara above the rest. The pies do tend to be on the softer side, and Dom uses lots of olive oil, as opposed to super-thin and crisp pies like at John's Â - but the combination of the tomatoes, the cheeses, the dough, the basil and the oil is a truly beyond belief. Â Try to go during off hours. If you're reading reviews of those who knocked Di Fara because they came in for a slice and waited 20 min or something, or those that don't even know how to spell the name of the establishment - just ignore them. We'll direct them back to Domino's or Papa John's or that disgusting Artichoke place. Â  Those who take the time to do their research know that this is authentic slow food - order a pie, sit, and savor."
"I went there with about several people and almost everyone loved their food. Â The swordfish is so-so and their veggie pastas (the ~$23 special - only thing vegetarian) was really really bad. Â  We also ordered the Calamari (appartizer) and it was more than enough for everyone, great deal with a group. The service is great and the staff is very very friendly. Â If you are a meat eater and want a nice meal with nice atmosphere, this place is great."
"It is one of the best restaurants in Chinatown. The food is delicious. Pastas are also amazing. The delivery is fast. A couple of suggestions on the dishes are : Papardelle Artichoke, falafel, and fries with chipotle mayo sauce (extra chipotle mayo sause)! Personnel is very friendly without trying to rush you when you are dinning there. The only tiny problem is that you have to give them your info every time you make an order for delivery. But I dont care cause the food is fantastic."
"We have eaten here many times before and invited friends for their first visit. We have never been disappointed. Service and food are always exceptional. Owner truly want you to enjoy your meal. For an appetizer, try the artichoke fritters with gorgonzola dip...yummy..and a large enough portion to share!"
Wonderful pizza and great little restaurant. Will be back next time im in town.
"Just so good. Â Deliciously spicy and filling. Â Had the chicken tikka and the potato roll and the chicken and egg one and all were great. Â I think the chicken and egg was my favorite. Â Such a nice blend of spices in them. Â Great lunch treat, if only it was a little closer to my office! Â There is a bit of a wait, but it's not too bad."
"This place is too damn charming for anything less than 4 stars. The food is hearty, not refined but absolutely soulful and delicious. The menu is limited, but who cares when a live blue grass band is serenading you,and you feel like you just stepped into diagon alley,an english pub, or perhaps even the cabin of a pirate ship. The point is, once you've stepped into Moto you're transported and the atmosphere really does provide for a relaxing, dare i say, merry brunch experience. The baked pancake is my favorite. flambe. delicious."
"best halal ever, in summer is a crazy line to get the special but is worth it!!!"
The food is always fresh. Prices are reasonable for the quality. Â Staff is very well trained and knowledgeable. Â I can't wait to go back and try the other tasty dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen. And I will DEFINITELY be back!
"Fast, fresh most of the times. Better to get take out, no seating, standing spots are usually full. Hot sauce will make you sweat alright. Overall great spot if you want something fast!"
"This one hurt, I was expecting so much more! The hush puppies were good but the rest of the meals was below average. Tuna tartare tasted like soy sauce, the onion rings were very greasy, the cod was so bland and they had the nerve to not put salt on the table, baked beet was cold and again super bland. Will never visit here again, the hush puppy got the second star for them. Oh yeah dessert a huge wash too"
"This restaurant was in walking distance of the Best Western Hanbee Bowery and it was such a warm, lovely place to find. The owner was our waiter and he was charming and engaging. We enjoyed salad and pizza and were intrigued to find everything locally sourced and organic. This drove the prices up a little but it was worth the atmosphere. Piacere means Pleasure. And it was."
Nice place to go for lunch
"Overall a great place in the neighborhood. Their Mac & cheese is the best. The half chicken is absolutely delicious! Sometimes I experience inconsistency in seasoning, especially with the burger/ chicken sandwich/ fish sandwich... I mean one day the burger is absolutely on the spot and the next day it's completely unseasoned. Almost as if sometimes the kitchen looses focus. If they cook their food consistently on their highest level, this place will succeed even more. Another issue for me is the staff. Usually great, a guy named Donny is very nice and professional, however I wish the staff would be a little more attentive to regular customers. The owner is a nice guy as well, polite, smiles at you and makes you feel comfortable."
I have been to this place several times and it does not ever disappoint. I only go on a weeknight and I never have to wait more then 5 minutes for a table but from my understanding the weekends are much longer wait times. CASH business so make sure you have it. Service can be sketchy but the food makes up for it.. You MUST get the watercress salad and don't forget the crispy fried pork belly entree..Heaven!!!
"Fantastic! Truly British inspired cuisine done to perfection. Great cocktail, wine and beer selection."
"We made the trip over to Bakehouse for French Restaurant Week and were glad we did! It's a little bit out of the way over on the West Side Highway but the view, food, ambiance and service make it worth your while. Â The large windows along the front allow for an amazing view of the sunset over the Hudson River. Â They're also working on getting their outdoor liquor license to add dining tables outside. Â As part of their French RW deal we got the artisanal charcuterie plate, croquet madame (an upscale French twist on grilled ham and cheese an egg on top) and 2 glasses of wine for a great price. Â We also ordered the seared sea scallops with celery root puree and basil ginger oil. Â Everything was absolutely delicious and we're already planning to go back to try out some of the entrees and their brunch. Â They also have a pretty solid selection of European beers, the boyfriend was ecstatic to find a great Belgian beer he hasn't seen since his trip over there. Â The rustic decor and romantic setting make it great for a date night with your beau, and the several long wooden tables make it a good spot to come with a group of friends as well. The service was also delightful and super helpful, Molly recommended a great glass of wine and the scallops for us. Â We're definitely fans of Bakehouse! @datenitenyc"
"Ok Yelpers, you REALLY let me down on this one. Â I see all the glowing reviews and I think...can't miss. I am going to say, this might be THE BIGGEST disappointment of any YELPED reviewed restaurants in my life. Â I was expecting so much and was so incredibly let down. I took a friend here from out of town and we were very excited to come here. The food is sooooo mediocre. Â The steak we got was cooked so poorly and to have the butcher right in the same building speaks volumes! Â How do you ruin a WAGYU RIBEYE? if the food was inexpensive, I would have given this place 2 stars, but for the given price point, biggest FAIL. Â I will NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE."
"This is a great find, look out for it. Their breakfasts are excellent and I stronly recommend the oatmeal. The eggs are also great. The menu is all organic and delicious. The decor is also refreshing and the staff very friendly. If you are in the 30th West search out for this place."
"I'm such a fan of Tartine. The small, compact space means you'll have to eat outside or wait in line, but the delicious food makes it worthwhile. I had a fruit cheesecake and my cousin had chocolate cake. With the coffee and desserts, eating sweets outdoor in the West Village turned Tartine into an unexpected delight."
Went here with 2 girl friends who love Japanese food as much as I do. We had been looking all over for authentic clean Japanese food and we found it here at Ootoya. The asari was delicious and the tonkatsu was the best I've had in NYC. Service was decent but could be more attentive. The place is extremely clean and simple which I loved. Â Make sure you get the earl grey ice cream!
"If you want low-key, tasty french food in a no frills environment where you can bring your own wine, you cant do better than this place. A real find. I've heard people say the waitstaff is rude, but if you are polite and reasonably patient, there will be no problem. The mixed green salad-- usually a snore of a dish-- is vibrant with rustic flavor and is quite refreshing. Great desserts too."
"I have been to Gramercy Tavern on three occassions and it has consistenty been a great experience. Â It is certainly a place to save for a nice occasion. Â I liked that although the restaurant has a classy atmosphere, it doesn't feel overly formal with a warm rustic French farmhouse feel. The first time I went with a friend and sat at the bar to order drinks and a late night dessert. Â We found the bartender to be very knowledgeable and he guided us through their drink menu to order a few unique beers on tap. Â You don't need a reservation to sit at the bar but they quickly cap the capacity of people who can stand around the bar so that their guests seated in the tavern for a meal aren't overcrowded. The second time I went with my mom for my birthday. Â We had dinner in the dining room and it was amazing. Â You'll need to make reservations well in advance for the dining room. Â The meals in the dining room are structured as pre-fixe tastings which may give you the opportunity to try an ingredient or combination that is new to you. Â The crab-stuffed ravioli were especially delicious. The most recent time I dined at Gramercy Tavern was on a Saturday afternoon date for a late lunch. Â We sat in the tavern room, which is available to walk-ins. Â By dining in the tavern room, you can avoid the hassle of booking a reservation a month in advance and the hit to your wallet, while you still get the same great service and food although the menu is more casual. Â The open faced ham sandwich is often the special on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and is a big hit. Â I'm not even a ham lover and found the meat to be incredibly moist and flavorful. Â We ended the meal with a hot chocolate 'martini' that is the version of their signature hot chocolate with amaretto and vanilla vodka."
"When you come to a place like this, i think you're looking for 3 things. Great service, Great food, and an Experience. Ai Fiori provides all three. We went with the tasting menu and it was definitely it was interesting having food prepared in a way i've never experienced before. I can't wait to go back."
"Reliable and delicious for a quick bite. I dig the special ketchups, chipotle and japaleno are winners. good prices on beer too. great stop for midday drinking"
This is the best food you can get late at night in midtown. It's only $6 for a full meal which is hard to find in midtown. It seems that the line is long no matter what time of the day I go but these guys are very quick so the line moves quickly. I don't usually eat lamb so I like the chicken over rice better but even the lamb is very good. Definitely better than all the other 'halal food' stands around the city
"I never made it to SHO, so when I read that Shaun Hergatt was opening a new place, I was excited. Â My partner and I went last Thursday, 8/22. Yes, it's a splurge: Â 4 courses for $90, 6 for $120, and the tasting menu for $180, but well worth it. The space is quiet, elegant and restrained. Â The decor is not perfect, but it is very nice. Â I very much like the menu format: with the 4 and 6 course meals, you can create your own meal: there are 5 categories: cold apps, hot apps, fish, meat and dessert - with 3 choices each, and you can chose any of the 15 for each course - great flexibility. (I use a 3 star rating system for each course, based on the Michelin restaurant rating system) Â  They served 3 amuses: a carrot tulle with goat cheese - **, a corn chowder custard - ***, and a wild mushroom ragout (or something) - **/***, all excellent - and they gave us 2 of each, so fortunately, ghw912's experience was not repeated here. summer squash - langoustine - naval orange reduction - marigold: Â ** (out of ***) Three well-sized Langoustine in a squash puree. The meat and sauce were very delicate and lively. Â I think the citrus notes were a little strong, and some of the meat was just slightly soft - overcooked I think. Still, quite wonderful. satur farms toy box tomatoes - bush basil - tomato gelÃ©e - blue basil flowers - * My partner's dish - I only had a taste. Â We are both familiar with Satur Farms' produce, and we both felt that this was tasty, but not at the level it should be - the tomatoes ARE the dish, and they were good, but not overwhelming with flavor like great heirlooms or Satur at their best. potato fondant - black bass - flourless gnocchi - curls - truffle sabayon: *** Just fabulous. This was laid out like a village with the Bass at the center. Each element was great, and the combination of flavors when I took bites together was sublime. Â The bass was done perfectly - light but rich in flavor with succulent skin. The gnocchi were airy with explosive chive flavor, and the sabayon was transcendent. My only issue was that there were fennel buds on top of some components, and I hate fennel, but I easily took them off and put them to the side. I think their flavor was too strong for the dish anyway. purple artichokes - ravioli - sylvetta arugula - pinenuts: ** My partner's dish. I have a food aversion to artichokes, but I can eat them occasionally if they are done exceptionally well, as they were here. Â Substantial artichoke ravioli. My Partner was thrilled with these and rightly so - great texture and flavor - light with a nice chewiness in the filling and a great juxtaposition between the dough and the inside. Â  anise hyssop - grimaud duck - chef's garden candy beets - hibiscus jus: *** When I took a bite of the duck, it was so rich and flavorful (and I eat A LOT of duck) that I actually said 'WOW' out loud. Â Juicy and rich, but firm. Â I was worried about the anise hyssop, but it was delicious and spicy, Â adding some rough texture to the creamy duck and an earthiness/vegetal/spiciness. Â The Beets were ok, and the jus was like a sweet, super-concentrated gravy - divine. Â Overall, one of the best duck dishes I have ever had. peaches and cream - cucumber - basil: ** This was my dessert. It was a dollop of peach ice cream on a layer of basil ice, I think - with cucumber yogurt mixed with peaches underneath. Â To be honest, this wasn't my exact style of dessert, with the yogurt and vegetal aspects, but it was so complex and tasty that it won me over. Â So many different textures and flavors combining. Frozen meringue - lemon - blueberry - sage: *** My partner's dessert. Â Wow, just wow. Â Now THIS is my type of dessert. After a few bites, I told K that she better take it back or I would finish it. Â The richness and sweetness of the light meringue were offset by the crisp and tart of the fruit, and the herbal essence of the sage. Â K referred to it as a 'deconstructed pavlova' and I think that is right on. Â  The petite fours were black mission fig beignets - ***, beet tulle - */**, anise leaves in chocolate - *, and nougat with celery salt - ***. Â The beignets were some of the best things we have eaten in the last year, and the nougat with celery salt was a crazy but brilliant combination that worked perfectly. Overall, the food was delicate, complex, focused, somewhat innovative, and delicious. Â As you can see from my ratings, there were a number of high notes, and the mean was consistent enough to categorize it as great. The service was very good, still finding its groove in places, but our primary server (Jason, I believe) was so good, spectacular actually, that I give the service the highest marks. Â The wine list is small, seasonal, and focused on solid boutique producers. Â I had a glass each of Riesling, Morgon VV, and Moscato D'Asti - all very good and reasonably priced. Â Overall, I would say that Juni is a welcome addition to the top tier restaurants in NYC, and I look to going back."
Easy on the hot sauce.
i have been to this restaurant numerous times and the last two times i did not enjoy my food...the fish i ordered was frozen fish and it tasted like it was too...the only good thing to order from there is the chicken and waffles.
"Pylos practically embodies my ideal go-to restaurant: appealing decor, good service most of the time, and pretty enjoyable dishes, albeit not terribly memorable. The lamb and spanakopita are some of my favorite dishes. The prices are normal for Greek places, though lunch is slightly cheaper and less busy. The mood of this place makes it suitable for a relaxed lunch, a slightly more formal dinner, or a date. I've only been here for brunch and lunch, I know I'm missing out on dinner. Next time."
"I really really like Diner. Â The food is excellent, worth the price, and they've even let me grab a cappuccino from Marlow next door and drink it there (they don't have espresso). Â Fine service. Â Cool interior. Â Quintessential Brooklyn. Â Took some friends from LA by and when I pointed it out they said, 'the shabby looking place?' and I laughed, because they recently renovated the outside, and I told them they couldn't even imagine what it looked like before. Â But they loved it. Â Of course they did! Â Just avoid going on the prime times, or you'll wait a LONG time for a table."
"We had a wonderful dining experience at ABC yesterday. All of our meals, appetizer to dessert, were exceptional. Our favourites -- roast carrot and avocado salad, ricotta and egg ravioli over a pork ragu, and salted caramel ice cream sundae. Super attentive service. Beautiful flowers on the tables. Bread, with aromatic olive oil and course salt. Just a perfect lunch!"
"Sorry, I just don't get the hype at this place. Â You wait for an hour and the food is really not all that great. Â Seems like a fun place and everyone was nice enough, just not worth wait IMO."
Extremely touristy and overpriced.
"Oh Traif, a restaurant that serves all of my favourite things was always going to be a winner. The food was great, quite a varied menu that is made up of smaller sharing dishes. A nice spread of options that were well done. The food wasn't 'gastronomy' but it was very flavourful and non-pretentious which I prefer. I would say as a warning - the dishes are billed as 'small plates' but they aren't all that small! We ordered 5 at the recommendation of our waiter but we were stuffed at four (might have been what we ordered though as we went for quite heavy rich food). It's not cheap but neither eyewateringly expensive our meal plus quite a few drinks came to $120 (not inc tip). If you like pork and seafood I would definitely recommend Traif."
"I've been told about this damn place for a minute. So dissapointed. Mac and cheese, looked good, didnt taste good. Overcrowed, the staff thinks they are divas. Â Expensive."
"Very usable web site; changes daily and includes specials. Have only been here for late lunch on a slow day, but was very impressed and plan to return. Waiter was unobtrusively attentive; burger was very tasty and chicken was high quality; prices were reasonable, and interior was new, comfortable, very clean and left us wanting to come check this place out on a busy night!"
Ill start it right off by saying the pizza and service there is great. I love the pizza crust! I made a mistake when I ordered and they had now problem fixing it and even offered me a drink while I wait. I can't wait to go back.
"If you wanna stay online for 1hour plus, deal with an old grumpy, slow paced owner who doesn't care about you just for 1 slice of pizza - than this is your place. I will admit the slice that I had was very good, but the uncleanliness and the run down look of the store makes - let alone the long waits makes this place very unattractive."
"A friend lives directly across the street from the one in Manayunk, Philadelphia. I went every time I visited him because it is the best Asian food I have ever had. I was excited when the one in NY opened so I could get my fix for Dan dan noodles more often. This place is just as good as the ones in Philly and is great. Everything on the menu is good. Bring friends and order alot of different things."
"WOW! What a great restaurant. Food, decor and service all top notch. Try the rotisserie chicken and the fresh shrimp. All desserts area fantastic. Can't wait for a second visit."
"Best pancakes and biscuits around. Everyone knows about the long wait. Best time to go 3-5pm in the weekdays. They tend to put too much blueberry sauce on the pancakes, so i ask them to put it on the side."
"My sister's favorite thing to eat when in NY! We share chicken + rice with lots of white and hot sauce! We generally leave out the pita (it kinda gets soggy gross), and bond while shoveling the deliciousness into our faces while Belgian tourists look with mixed expressions of impressiveness and horror."
This place was ok . The decor is nice rustic and warm .I was not very impressed with the service. Â The food was ok but I have definitively experienced better.The wine list is decent .I Â came here because of one of my friend decided to go. I am not dazzled enough to come back or reccomend it to anyone else.
"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the food was delicious, full of flavour and authentic. Great service and atmosphere. Fully recommend to anyone who wants to taste a little bit of Peru."
"Overrated. Overpriced. Service: The waitress was so nice. In fact she smothered us with her ""niceness."" Â Always pushing for us to buy more meat & drinks in the ""nicest way."" I found it very pretentious & disingenuous. Food: Tiny slivers of meat--about 6 to 8 paper thin pieces. Rice costs like $3 extra for a small bowl and virtually no side dishes unless you count 2 pathetic micro sides for two. Our main was more like an appetizer & the total was about $80 plus tip. We left hungry."
This might be only the third time I truly think a full establishment deserves a 5 star review. Everything was on point from the drinks to the food to the service. We had the fruit guacamole that was great. I was worried the sweetness of the fruit would get in the way but it was delicious. We also tried the quesadilla with manchego and truffle with roasted corn which was amazing. We almost ordered 10 more. The last thing we tried was the short rib tacos. I stole the rest or my girlfriends when she wasn't looking. We might break up because of it. We had a few different cocktails. I had the smoky mescalita de piÃ±a and my girlfriend had the melocita. Both were great and I'll definitely come back because the have a lot of great happy hour drinks too. Finally our service was amazing. Incredibly accommodating by answering all of our questions. We sat at the bar and they really took care of us. Best dining experience I've had in the neighborhood yet.
"Very large portions to say the least. Â i got a spinach and swiss omelette, my friend got the pecan banana french toast. Â food was good, place was cramped. Â typical for les nyc though."
We just knew immediately on entering this restaurant for the first time that it was going to be good. It so didn't disappoint. A timeless elegant dining space bursting with atmosphere. A unique & interesting menu. The food was mouth-wateringly delicious . The service was exceptional . From start to finish an incredible dining experience.
"Best pizza on Franklin Ave., hands down. The food is great, the atmosphere is great, and the prices are great! What's not great? Â Only that I can't eat pizza every day.. lol. :)"
"I've been to the Cliton Baking Company, a couple of times. Â Once around dinner time, and then around 11am.. Â There was no wait during the evening hours. Â Ofcourse there was a wait around 11am. Â The host said, 1.5 hours ""maby even more""...... Â So, I took the advice of the others and got it to go.. They pack the food up really well... They have their own shopping bags. Â  All together, I got three different items. Â The French Toast, The Eggwhite omlet, (mushrooms, goat chese) and The blueberry pancakes (ofcourse). Â  I'm not a big fan of French Toast, but it looked really gr8 (I think some1 else postd a pic).... Â The eggwhite omlet was really good... Fluffy. Â I was thinking maby, I shouldve asked for additional veggies.. But it was good as is.. The only thing, I thought it had 2 much cheese. (but that's just my preference, I like a very small amount of cheese, and it wasn't overkill, just a tad much 4 me). Now for the blueberry pancakes... CSB is known for their pancakes. Â They have featured reviews in the restroom. Â They are that good. Â I've never had any pancakes that compare. Â I've had soo many pancakes from diners, and IHOP. Â But today, I had fluffy, flavorable, pancakes.. Â  I only wish this plce was bigger. Â And maby add to their dinner menu."
"I have now been back several time since my first reviews - the tomato soup had a weird twang tartness to it that I did not enjoy. Â I also got the rosemary flat bread which I really liked. Â However every time I go to this restaurant the food doesn't sit well with me at all. Â I leave feeling pretty sick. Â Also the menu is not very vegetarian friendly for dinner. Â Basically the only option it the veggie burger which I was not in the mood for, so I Â had to resort to appetizers as my meal."
"MOST OVER-RATED restaurant in NYC...maybe even in the world. Â TERRIBLE experience. Â HORRIBLE FOOD. Â  How do you ruin a such a great piece of meat when your owners of Japanese Premium Beef? Â How do you ruin this? Â I will tell you how...buy frying it and letting it sit in a pot full of FRIED and HOT vegetables upon letting the meat rests so that it gets steamed. Â If this place was not so pricey, MAYBE I would give it 3 stars....BUT I CANNOT forgive bad and even worse cooking technique when your the owners of such a great butcher shop and when you charge so much for your food. I could give a rats a** if you have to have an ""in"" to get into this place. Â Please, just go buy some meat from their butcher shop and cook it at home yourself. Â  I left ANGRY"
Great meal for only $6! Lamb and chicken are always fresh due to high turnover unlike others in the area that have meat that's been cooked for hours. Excellent white sauce! I visit the Halal Guys every time I'm in town!
i would come back and get it if they line is reasonable and the weather is good. their white sauce is definitely different from the other place i've tried. i think i taste creme cheese in addition to mayo. the red sauce is HOT!!! everyone already mentioned the portion size being big enough to split with another friend. lemonade stand nearby when we went. definitely needed to counteract the spicy red sauce.
This place is my absolute favorite! I've never been disappointed when going to Joya. Â The food is delish and relatively cheap. Â The only downfall of Joya is that they do not accept credit but it is definitely worth it!
"This place was fine, but very much overhyped. I came with a couple of girlfriends for brunch. The server was very distracted and not-too helpful. I had a breakfast scramble, and it was unimpressive. Not terrible, but far from memorable, or even good. Pretentious crowd, even for Chelsea."
Ehhhhhh. Congee is okay. Lobster e-mein was average. Toronto has way better. Ja leung was good. No peanut sauce though. Also had to dap toi (share a table with other people.) Would probably not come back.
"Gorgeous food and friendly staff. Hint - don't order individual meals as the portions are huge. There were 4 of us and we ordered 1 starter, 1 Main and 1 desert between us all and even at that there was some left over. We ordered the salad, meatballs and chocolate torte. Could have no complaints about any of it. Cocktails were also delicious. Not pricey either. Our bill came to $98 for l fod and drinks. A perfect restaurant in New York!"
good food and atmosphere. but too crowded and unfriendly service. at least i got the impression of an unprofessional staff. but food is still alright and good place for larger parties.
"Make reservations! fills up quickly and for good reason. Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. Will become a favourite when visiting East Village."
delishaliciolous. That being said the savory crepes are more special than the sweet ones. The calimocho at just a few dollars a glass is mocho fun. And the servers are all darlings.
"Out of the way and tiny, but it's the home of the best desert in NYC. The Warm Date Cake. Â Worth a late night trip just for that. And go late, because otherwise you'll be waiting for one of the 10 seats to open up. But totally worth the hassle."
Awesome food. Decor a little strange. Good place to eat with friends on a casual Sunday.
"I've been to Cafeteria twice now. Â Both times, the service was fantastic and the food was even better! Â I came at night and had to wait a little bit before we were seated, but after that everything was smooth sailing. Â Their Mac N Cheese sampler is very good!! Â Will definitely go back!"
"It was our anniversary,our friend recommended us to try this place. Our reservation was for 10.30pm because they had nothing before that..however First thing we walkin and see empty tables in the front.. We arrived early by 9.45pm and asked the hostess(amateur) if there's a table available earlier then please get us seated..she said she will try..We r still seeing the front tables empty but not bothering the hostess assuming it's reserved.. Now 30 minutes pass by,we are still waiting,we see a couple walkin and they tell the hostess we don't have a reservation but mentioned they knew somebody,and they were given a table in 5mins.. We r still waiting and mind you they have no waiting area we r just standing by the bar.. After 35mins I ask the hostess what about these tables in the front..and she goes like'Oh you don't mind seating in front' I was like ya we just wanna eat and get out of there..Wish she had asked us 40mins ago I would have said yes..but know that we waited this long wanted to see what special arrangements they had for us inside.. Now it's 10.30pm our reservation timing..Still no table..eventually they seat us inside at 10.45pn In a nice table.. Umm the food was good.that's y the 2 stars.. For main we had,spaghetti which was great..but steep price $24 ..but still worth it as it's perfectly balanced with the sauces and spices. Starters..Polenta mushroom was nice too $19 I wish it was served hot though... Also had crispy fritto misto $17 I wish they had some more calamari in it..it was 2 pieces of calamari ring,some cauliflower,green beans..Meh.. Seems like they r keeping the food cost low to make high profit margin..again wish it was served hot,it was luke warm. We wanted to try the desert as it was our anniversary Â but after the horrible experience with the hostess just wanted to get out of there.. No apologies from management..Coz I'm sure they think they are too good..and don't care about the customers..and making good money with small quantity of food. I hope they can fix the hostess and train her well to do her job!!!"
like this place.....good food...good people
you have to order Â by the pie but its still awesome !
"I love this place for it's weds night prix fixe suppers, for brunch, and not to mention for copious amounts of whiskey! Good stuff! YUM!"
"Yay! This is one of my favorite restaurants! It's teeny tiny though, so try to go during off hours. Favorites include aufschnitt teller appetizer. Which is a platter of their homemade meat spreads, cured meats and pickles. The emmentaler sausage with savoy cabbage and quark dumplings is deeeeelicious! Cheesy dumplings and cheesy sausage, come on! Goulash and spatzle is also really good. Next I'm going to try their spÃ¤tzle with snow peas, shiitake, and peppercorn sauce. Yum. The pretzel's also on my list for next time. German beer selection includes pretty standard stuff (hofbrau maibock and dunkel, etc) Nice and romantic as well."
soulful
"I really wanted to try the paella and I was disappointed. For me it was more rice with seafood than real paella. The empanadas and calamari were good. The service was ok ... The place itself is so small, I didn't fell that much comfortable."
"BBQ you can smell from the BQE The brisket is more tender than a teddy pendergrass ballad, wings hotter than a night with Kate Upton, and cole slaw cooler than that time you saw yourself on google maps street view. Megan and Rebecca kept the drinks and good vibes flowing all night. The bearded pit master dude was the main hoss, and all the other staff seemed like friendly, trained professionals. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, which is good if you're the type of person who often sends food back to be remade and fears that an annoyed cook might leave you a little present. All in all, a 5 star experience. This place is as real as it gets. Seriously, next time you're hungry in Brooklyn, skip all the overpriced, ironic American comfort food places, and go right to the source. Your taste buds will love you long time."
the variety of pickles were awesome and the mac & cheese was really good.
"Excellent Cuban Food. Â My sister had a get together and invited me here for the first time. Â The Yucca is great, and I had a great fish dish with plantains. Â Going back in a few weeks."
"Best Crab Cakes ever!! No batter or bread crumbs- just straight up lump crab meat!! Amazing octopus, and Chicken kabobs!! A tad pricey but well worth it if you're looking to get your greek fix!"
"Lemongrass chicken banh mi. Perhaps not a traditional banh mi, but a great sandwich nonetheless. I was hungry when I stopped in, and was a little disappointed at the size of the sandwich, but it ended up being quite filling. Perfect for the price."
My new Malaysian restaurant. Great authentic food with a diverse menu. Prices are cheap and quality of food is good. Alot of locals eat here so that's also a very good sign. Don't expect a place with decor or design - it's basically a hole in the wall with authentic food and fast service. Waitstaff are very attentive too even when the place is busy.
"A friend recommended Balaboosta. I'm glad he did.The menu is divided into three sections: small plates, appetizers and entrees. We shared 5 small plates among the table, and then we ordered variously two appetizers or an entree. Without exception, the food was absolutely delicious - we didn't have anything that wasn't fantastic. We had all of the small plates but one; the best were the zucchini fritters and the burrata, but the hummus was a close runner-up. The ""Israeli Street Fair"" (chicken and lamb sausage on a pita with onions and yogurt sauce, with pickles and sweet potato fries) was great, as was the pizza and the salmon ceviche (a daily special). The chicken under a brick and beet pasta were also terrific. We'll probably go back to try the other half of the menu. We've been to a lot of restaurants in New York City; Balaboosta is definitely one of the best. And while not cheap, it's a good value - the portions are generous and we all left satisfied. Highly recommended!"
"ok, I LIVE for izakayas. I grew up with them, and finding a place that actually satisfies me in NYC... is rare. But this place did it for me ;) Super cheap, but recently they raised the price (recession, I understand)- but the portions also got a bit smaller! When I first came here 3 years ago, everything was huge for what I paid for. I usually get: BBQ kalbi ribs Liver sashimi (LOVE) Yellowtail sashimi Deep fried chicken gizzard Fried chicken (looove the ponzu sauce) Daikon salad Hokke ---and a ton of sapporo + iichiko shochu with lemons. Oh and for the ones that have high expectations for ramen, this isn't your place. Hagi is an IZAKAYA, they serve small dishes that are good with your drinks. After seeing a few people eat ramen here, meh, don't even bother. Keep it simple with the sauteed/fried/sashimi dishes. I know, my selection is not good for the ones with high blood pressure, may clot your arteries but it's delicious! OH and occasionally they have uni (sea urchin) sashimi on their specials list so every time I come I pray it's there. My only problem is that there is a ridiculous wait-list on weekends (and sometimes even during the weekday- its midtown- all the Japanese salarymen come out for drinks). Also, I see a bunch of fruit flies flying around all the time, especially in the sectioned corner on the left when you walk in. I don't know where they come from, but I hope they get rid of them soon."
The empanadas oh so yummy! It was heated and ready to eat. I will definitely go back. My tummy is happy. :p
I don't understand what all the hype is about?? Â I love rustic but the decor feels dirty not old and cool. Â Unfortunate for them I am not a fan of string fries with my burger so maybe I'm the wrong person to ask but I was disappointed.
This pizza is great
"If you're looking for a festive way to while away the hours over delicious guacamole, a nice draft beer, and a quesadilla or two, then look no further! Â Salads are delicious, too! Â  Music can be a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so. Â  All in all, a great option in the neighborhood!"
"I had a most memorable event here-- thank you jadis! jadis is the perfect place to have a get-together. the staff is kind and the venue is laid-back, even as the platters are as gourmet as can get."
love it
"This was a busy, noisy restaurant, full of people having a good time. It was relaxed and friendly. The service was good and the food very fresh and tasty. Not a good place for a quiet dinner but great if you have noisy kids as no one will notice!"
"pizza is hugeeeeeeeee. it is 4 bucks so i guess it has to be. you will be full after one slice. it is very very good pizza i would def reccomend. however, the line is often long so go early. the staff r very nice and they own a place a few doors down so there is extra seating. there is a very nice guy who when he sees u eating on the street, invites you into their partner store a few doors down to sit. a very nice touch to a great pizza place"
Their squares are the truth!
"Hand's down, the best pizza I have evr tasted."
"I've always loved this place - but I agree it feels a bit pretentious considering the wait times. The Moroccan scramble is worth the wait though, I can't lie. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also a gem, it's cozy but as soon as you walk in you feel like you're in a different era. Great vegan choices as well. If you're up for the wait, go for it, if not try Lokal across the street."
"It's good. Â Best ever no, but quality. Â Three key rating categories for the sandwich: 1) Falafel balls: above average for nyc, but not israeli standards. 2) Pita: above average. 3) Roll your own capability: no dice, it all goes on behind the glass. Â Can't really 'have it your way'. Â Not to mention when you get halfway through the sandwich and want to reload, forget it. Â Points for Maoz here. But as someone else said, you really go here for the Sabich."
"It has been a long time not to eat sandwich with the sauce all over my face. It is just too good to eat slow. I had the grill Spanish Mackerel today. The fish is fresh. I love the combo taste of the pink mayo sauce mixed with the fresh cilantro, skimpy thin slice of cucumber and a generous heap of shredded pickled carrot. The bun is crunchy, not too hard. The grilled butter wrap all bites heavenly. Next time I will try eating in and sit on the low chair."
"The prices are good, the vibe is energetic and the food is great! Rubirosa Salad - simple arugula salad with onions, cherry tomatoes, lots of mozzarella balls, parmesan cheese, and a thick balsamic dressing. Â  Service was good, food was excellent. Â I have nothing bad to say Rubirosa. Cannot wait for another lunch-time visit."
"The food is excellent, as long as you make sure you order real Shanghai food. They have added a number of Cantonese and Chinese-American dishes to the menu, so it is often difficult to know what the real good stuff is. Some advice: Stay with the cold appetizers, soup dumplings (some of the best in NY), yellow fish dishes, Lion's Head, Shanghai style noodle dishes and a few other things (although I must admit, the salt and pepper squid, a Cantonese dish, as also excellent)."
"A living legend. Â I'm writing the review in July 2011 but i ate here years ago, when the old man was the only one made the pies. Â I would come here with a friend and we would order a round pie with sausage and a Sicilian pie, and we would know em both off. Â Super High Quality!!! cheeses, sauces, dough, meats, everything here is amazing. Â GO before its too late."
This place is a great place to come when you are drunk out of your mind in the city.
"WoW, I am impressed about this place. I discovered this place when they just opened about half years ago. After I moved I just never pass by this street again. Somehow the randomness brought me back to 12th street and I wish I came back earlier. The food here was amazing. I ordered mushroom sandwich. It was so good. The place has cute decor and friendly service. Lots of good stuff on the menu. I am so coming back for more !!"
Loved the brunch.. very buttery.. but so good
"My quest for the perfect falafel. Recently I have such a craving for falafel. I remembered like 2 years ago I visited Mamoun and it was oh so delicious. So last night I was there with my girls in the city. The line is long as usually, hot, no where to sit. But when you take a bite on the sandwich seems to forget about all those thing. Â The hot sauce Â is HOT. Do not attempt to over pour. This is great spot for vegetarian. TASTY falafel."
"Went only for the burger, which I'd been told was so good. I really don't get it. I preferred the marginally cheaper burgers at Five Napkin, and I've had $7 burgers that were far better. Â There was plenty of grease/juice on my plate, but I'm not sure how much came from the burger and how much from whatever they put on top. Maybe I just prefer the patties that are less dense and fall apart more. For $16 I don't think the burgers here are worth it compared to others in the city. On the plus side, seven hours later I'm still not hungry, so I guess that's something."
"Tried the spicy sausage and italian pizzas here. Thought they were both pretty solid. The atmosphere is standard for Lombardi's, but we went late night (12 pm) and we seated immediately. I did not find the prices outrageous."
"Fantastical... Beef Rib eye slow cooked in water with mixed vegetables and a huge BEER.. I think it was about 32 oz.. not sure though.. either way.. very genuine experience. Stumbled out of there with a nice clean fill, and a great attitude. Recommend it for groups, first date, and practicing Japanese. Advice: Do not touch the middle.. Until next time we swim in beef and veggies, PWILDE"
Some of the best ramen that I have had in New York. Â Lines are stupid long and honestly not worth it most of the time. Â Have it once and remember that ramen isn't supposed to be that expensive!
"This restaurant has exceptional service, doesn't get any better! The food is exquisite too!"
"I just had the greatest dinner at little owl. Â Ok after 2 weeks of trying to get a reservation for 5 at 7:00, i finally changed my plans to get there at 5:30. Â The staff was accommodating and very nice. Â The place is small but cozy. Â I had the gnocchi appetizer and the pork chops. Â Super good. Â Im not sure of the sauce for the pork chops but i will say that it resembled more of a filet mignon than anything else. Â Quite special. Â My homemade gnocchi was also very good, the only problem was that another person at our table had another pasta appetizer and it kills me but i can't remember the name...it was even better than mine! What would i change...hmm...not much except maybe get a bigger restaurant haha. Â Its worth the two stars in the times thats for sure, maybe three?"
"I absolutely LOVE this place. Â It NEVER fails. Â Ever. Â Quality. Â Consistency. Â Great food. Â Lovely ambiance. Â Friendly, knowledgeable servers. Â Reasonable prices. Â Not crazy crazy busy that you have to wait 3 hours. Â Good espresso, also! I've been going here for years. Â I do breakfast (scone: the best in all of NYC, the frittata sandwich: the best way to start your day!!), grab baked items (ALWAYS delicious), come for dinner, sometimes a snack (oysters, anyone?), and what I like the most is that you can come for only dessert, get it to go during their dinner service and sit outside on their tables and eat it. Â No pressure. Â  Of course the dessert is their chocolate salted caramel pie thing. Â The BEST dessert EVER. Â I love this place. Â Have Â I mentioned that I love that dessert? Â Maybe more than my boyfriend. Â Hmm, I won't tell him that. Â But I'd be hard pressed to choose. Keep doing what you're doing, Marlow & Sons!"
Don't get it. Â The food is quite bad and service leaves much to be desired.
"Vin et Fleurs is completely charming. Â Have been here a couple of times for brunch. It's the little things and thoughtfulness behind the food and atmosphere that make this place stand out. For example, Â the first time I ate here, they warmed the milk for the coffee, the orange juice tasted freshly squeezed and there were gorgeous flower arrangements around and nice little vases with flowers on all the tables. Â The food was great and there is thoughtfulness behind the preparation and presentation. Â Nice quiet place for brunch."
"I'm always looking for places that offer an abundance of fresh, organic and vegetarian options... and this place didn't disappoint. It was crowded on a Wednesday evening (always a good sign) and the crowd included a recognizable actress and her family. I can only vouch for what we ate (the heirloom tomato salad, the lacinato kale and pear salad, the grilled wild salmon and the roasted squash stuffed w/eggplant caviar), but everything was beautifully presented, tasted delicious and was adequately sized. I would definitely eat there again, even if the Eleventh Ave location is a bit off the grid."
The food I tried does not make me crave this place nor would I come back again because I think I can find another place that's cheaper with the same amount of ingredients. The menu may not be as creative but at least the classic sandwich will be better.
"Love this place!! The cocktails are delish and the bartenders (mixologists?) are very knowledgeable. Â The only con is that there only appears to be one bathroom, maybe two for the whole place and after consuming so many cocktails, waiting in such a long line is not fun. Â Overall, great experience."
"I finally meandered over to Dos Toros T. and tried two of their soft shell tacos.. both the chicken and the pork. Â  The chicken one I added guac on it, and wow the guacamole is among the best you can get. I put the freshly made salsa sauce on both, and skipped the hot sauce. Â  Both the chicken and pork are tender, delicious, and have a slight charcoal broiled flavor to them. Â  The restaurant is so tiny.. the line for take out and self serve was nearly out of the entrance way. Â  I patiently waited and got my food, but I couldn't buy the Negro Mondelo for take out.. you must drink it on the premises, and there was no seating left. I was a little upset they only gave me one thin paper bag for the two tacos.. as they started to leak on my way home with them via a cab. Still the prize I took home was worth the trip! Â  :) Probably next time I'll try just one burrito ... as they are so large, that one is a full meal for any NY Giants or Jets linebacker. Â ;)"
"Very elegant and stylish decor and has a very exquisite air. Â We had the five course choice menu where we chose appetizer, rice/noodle, fish, meat, and desert. Â Each dish sounded more interesting than what it actually was. Â I know it's supposed to be modern but to me the food lacked the intense flavor of authentic Korean food, and did not have the consistency/flow as a course. Â It does not compare with the French restaurants of the same price range. Â The best part was the amuse bouche. Â The cocktails were very unique and refreshing. Â I would probably not go back."
"A more relaxed/casual atmosphere from Tournesol across the street. Â Lattes are huge and strong. Food is on the basic side with your usual breakfast/brunch, salad, sandwich, crepe options. On menu, it says all eggs are organic. Food preparation/quality is basic. Good place to go for a casual bite in the neighborhood. They have a large selection of magazines for customers to look through which is nice."
"My sister and I came here for a Friday lunch - they will call you the day before to confirm your reservation. We both ordered the prix fixe for about $30 Â per person, with the meal inclusive of soup or salad, a combination of rolls and sushi pieces, and a mochi ice cream dessert. You also get complimentary tea at the end of the meal. I don't recall the specific rolls we ordered (we definitely had salmon, tuna, squid, and eel), but it didn't matter because everything was super fresh and delicious. We got to sit at the sushi bar which was a treat because we could watch all the sushi chefs make lovely pieces of sushi with quick and practiced motions. Service was really great as well - our waiter answered all our questions and was prompt and courteous. We both left satisfied and full. What a great value for getting some of the best sushi in NYC for lunch!"
"this place is just like tokyo! great atmosphere , food and service! want to use for dating for sure grilled sea bass was an amazing! i will definitely going back only for that! im so happy my friend told me this place!"
"I don't get the rave reviews. Meatballs are tasty, but why the 40 minute to an hour waits? It meant we were kind of bussed and booted out the door as soon as the last meatball was lifted from the dish. Boyfriend was a fan of the mustard greens, but the salad was kind of bland, as was the fennel risotto. Not the best compliment (too delicate) for meatballs, I thought. As for the balls themselves, can't go wrong with pork. The beef were fine, but not necessarily better than what I could throw together myself, and I'm not a chef. we were suckers for the gimmick, I guess."
"The food was good, great tasting, fresh and great quality. Our waitress and table runner were just amazing, incredibly attentive but not so much so that it felt intrusive. Decor is a distressed Parisian style, although in some places a little over done so that is looks grubby, but I assure you it isn't. Highly recommended."
"This is a very cozy, warm and delectable establishment. Top notch service. Â Polenta with truffles and endive and radicchio salads are a must. Atmosphere is great - very romantic and cosy. Really great for a date or any other kind of intimate dinner. Service was great too."
"Cassandra M. and Carmelle F. were super duper and not to mention HELLA nice of them to invite me to their trip to Brooklyn. Thank you gals oh so much for letting me come along and taking me here with y'all. I went a bit crazy thinking about this trip...I thought about ordering a WHOLE QUART of Lobster Bisque. I love love love Lobster Bisque! When we got here I was going NUTSO, I was like OMG I want everything and I usually like to milk all of my far and away trips, since who knows when I will be back here again. I shared a Shrimp Roll with Carm - it was AIGHT...Luke's so much better. Lobster Bisque - Before I got ahead of myself and ordered a QUART load of this thing...I overheard someone asking to sample it. Luckily, I did because this bisque wasn't what I am used to - it wasn't the beautiful coral roe colour, instead it was this muddy looking colour that made me say WHAT is this? After sampling it, I figured I should just order a cup of this because I thought perhaps with the lobster meat...the bisque would be better. I have to say this has to be the worst bisque I ever had and I'm disappointed that Carm couldn't taste what a ""good"" bisque taste like and this just wasn't a good sample. But I'll give this place 4 STARS for their Lobster Roll - really good chunks of Lobster meat and they are definitely not shiesty like Mermaid Inn - meanwhile half of the cost! The meat couldn't be contained in the buttery toasted bread. YUMS! I am upset that I didn't order the Lobster Dinner. Since I didn't know it was like a whole lobster - I thought it was a combo meal! Otherwise I would have tried the whole menu but minus the Connecticut version of their Lobster roll, which is just warm with butter! Thanks again girls - Y'all the best!!!!!"
"I've only been to Degustation twice, but both times have been fanastic. There's simply nothing better than taking a few hours to work your way through the tasting menu with friends, watching your food being prepared with expert precision and care by the chefs right in front of you. Service was impeccable both times, a benefit of the tiny (TINY) number of seats which are positioned around the prep area. Dishes are perfectly proportioned for a tasting menu, with a rich variety to keep the interest level high. Wine selection matches the food perfectly."
"Stopped by for a snack and was amazed by how great the food was! The Al Pastor taco and nachos were just excellent. I cannot stress how good the food was, worth a trip to visit for sure. While the taco was not huge the nacho portion was very large so bring your appetite."
"Went here to get a snack after a night of drinking and it was delicious! I got 3 falafel sandwiches: the first one, I made a mistake by putting a lot of the red sauce and man it was spicy! so I threw that one away. And cause it was delicious, I ate 2 sandwiches. Cause I ate it when I was drunk, I went back when I wasn't drunk to confirm the deliciousness. And the verdict is...its still amazing! Small place but its GOOOD! Go easy on the red sauce though~"
"I'm reluctant to write this review, because I don't want them to get too crowded! A great neighborhood spot. Cozy and warm, with excellent food."
"I think the chef accidentally spilled the bag of salt into our meals while preparing them. The Biscuits Benedict and the Chile Marinated Shrimp were both smothered in salt. The portions were much more decorative then for eating purposes. Ironically, the way you are rushed out of the place, you couldn't even appreciate it from an art angle if you wanted to! It's also a shame, because the Shrimp had a nice spicy touch to it(though too spicy for my girlfriends taste, so not for those who aren't that into spicy food), and perhaps the biscuits and honey smoked ham would have been pretty good, otherwise. But we both suspected that the salt was making up for a lack of other flavor, for the most part. It's a really trendy place, the prices are a bit up there for the amount of food you get, and the wait staff is over you like hawks, so there isn't the right atmosphere for a slow, pleasant brunch conversation. Â We made the best of it, but probably about as undesirable a place as there is to ever return to, I'm sorry to say."
Still one of my favorite brunch spots after all these years. And it's larger now -meaning less waiting. Cocktails are fantastic. I can't see how one goes wrong here.
"I had come here in November and thought the food was amazing, this time it failed to amaze me. The pasta I had was mildly Â cold, big disappointment being that I loved it the first time and had raved about it to other people."
"This place is really great place to visit. I have had their pizze and it is truly second to nothing. There is a reason why places like that are mad popular, because they make really good food. Â I think that everyone who lives in new york, should at least try this pizza once!! !"
Its okay. The soup was okay. Noodles were good. The cuts of meat were weird. Never seen tendon look like that. Very divey ambience. Pretty sure they live in the basement.
Great for brunch and dinner! It's a large place that can fit a lot of people but definitely recommend reservations as it is usually crowded. Terrific food!
"Four star food, two star service. I've had to wait for a table even with a reservation. The lamb sandwich (with chickpea frites) is amazing. I could only eat half of it before I was nauseatingly full so the portion size was generous as well."
"one way to open a restaurant is to do one or two things well and pretend you're good at other things. or you could just do those two things. lucali epitomizes the latter (and, in my opinion, better) approach. it's worth the wait."
We celebrated my cousin's 24th birthday at this cozy little restaurant last night and everyone enjoyed the meal -- from appetizers (recommend the spicy lemon shrimp) to the last bite of our guinness dark chocolate cake!
"This is a Japanese noodle chain, this being the NY variety. I went rather late at night and enjoyed a steaming hot bowl of pork ramen with egg. I can't really complain - the ramen was fine - and the atmosphere was reasonable. I guess I just had higher expectations having dined at the originals in Japan. Still, for ramen fans looking for a solid outing, this is a good spot. Be prepared to wait, though - it's generally extremely crowded."
"Talk about potatos, alot of dame good potatos! These fancy thick and crispy belgian fries where YUMMY!!!! Man this is a little place and the line was out the door! But we did find a place to have a seat, I might say it is kind of comfy..............? FANCY FRIES: We had a double order with three sauces, which runs u about $10.25. Yeah the DOUBLE ORDER(u could feed at least four people) and we where only two hungry dudes. SAUCES: Roasted Garlic Mayo :-| Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo :-) :-) Cheddar Cheese :-) Theres soo many sauces, 30+ Nice place to have fries, cause thats the only thing thats on the menu, its worth the visit."
Really yummy paninis for cheap! Try the prosciutto and mozzarella or the nutella panini! They also have non-alcoholic frozen mojitos. Only downside is there are only outside stools - which is only inconvenient bc the sandwiches are so big.
"I don't know why there's such a hype about this place. To start, my friends and I got there a little bit before they opened and there was already a line. I didn't mind waiting, even though I was starving, since my friend already told me that the line moves fast anyway. The line did move fast. There's one guy collecting the money and the other guy for ordering and getting the food. It's not their service I'm rating 3 stars though: it's the food. The chicken over rice came in a tin foil pan, okay, whatever. But the chicken was chopped so fine that it kind of just mushed into the rice and sauce. It's a personal preference, but I prefer my meat to have some texture so I don't feel like I'm eating something grounded, which, honestly, can be anything."
"Very good and authentic Italian cuisine. We loved the whole experience. Good for business, family, business dinner. Very nice atmosphere. Some waiters are so authentic that they hardly speak English. :)"
"Salinas seems like a launch pad for a night out in meatpacking - lots of large groups of girls in tight dresses getting the party started for the night. Â Which was unfortunate because Salinas has the potential to be a really great, romantic and intimate date spot, but I wouldn't totally rule it out since we did go at 10pm on a Friday night. Â They have really good specialty cocktails, awesome tapas (must try the quail wrapped with bacon) and a DELICIOUS suckling pig entree that we split. Â Try going earlier in the night or on a weeknight so you don't catch the pre-club crowd and Salinas is sure to be a great date spot for some awesome Spanish/Mediterranean food. @datenitenyc"
"This place is amazing. from the appetizer to the entrÃ©e to dessert and oh! the drinks!. I had scallops, jasmine rice, crÃ¨me brullee, lucytini, pomegranate martini, my husband had rib eye steak and coconut ice cream with fresh pineapples. I cannot complain. The service was incredible, attentive, nice. It's pricey so someone like myself will only go there once a year for my anniversary but it is so worth it."
"Had a very poor experience before being seated. We were told that the wait would be 30 minutes (fine), and that we would be texted when the table is ready. The text came in 30 minutes, but we weren't seated until 20+ minutes after the message. They did provide a free appetizer (the breakfast pastry platter) as an apology, which was nice and good. At that point, feeling pretty good about Cookshop. Then the main course came, and it was just mediocre. Completely average cheeseburger for this level of restaurant."
"All the previously wonderful experiences I've had at GT aside, I went this evening for dinner at the bar and didn't make it past the first drink. I came in around 5:40p tonight and was pleasantly acknowledged by the host. I told him I was going to have a drink at the bar and he said 'welcome.' So far so good. I found a spot right away where two guys had been eating and drinking. In front of me, two empty wine glasses, two empty water glasses, two place mats and two used napkins. In other words, the bar needed to be cleared and wiped down of crumbs. I waited. And I waited some more. Ten minutes passed and not a single server approached me; much less cleaned up the dirty debris. A woman sitting two seats over leaned over and commented on the lack of service; she noticed the oversight; who wouldn't have? I was being snubbed. There were two bartenders making drinks, chatting it up with customers and a manager-type hanging back there too. I was curious how long it would take before someone took notice that I was waiting for a little attention in what has always been, in my experience, a very well run restaurant. I resolved not to raise my hand, voice or make some sort of visual plea for service. At the point that I was about to bolt, a woman bartender came over and started removing some of the dirty glassware and asked if I knew what I wanted. No warmth, no apology no personality. I told her I'd like to see a drink menu and she handed one over. I should have left but after flipping through the binder of offerings settled on one of their $13 house cocktails. It was okay. I had planned to spend a couple of hours here; 2-3 drinks, dinner, etc. I left after one drink."
"Nice restaurant, nice vibe good value, Â priced right. Â Drinks priced right and made strong, they definitely don't cheap out on the alcohol. Â Worth a visit"
$4 dollars for a plain slice of pizza. Nothing special about this place. It's still just pizza when you're better off getting a burrito with more stuff inside. Lame.
Everyone makes a big stink about there squares. All that sauce gives me heartburn!!! The only reason I'm giving you 3 stars is for your spumoni ice cream
"Really good thin crust pizza! We had half with extra mozzarella and half with meatballs. Mixing both would probably be too much, but like that it was really great!"
"A nice selection of sandwiches, pasta and such. there is also a small selection of meats, cheeses, and prepared foods. Â The service was friendly and the food was fresh and full of flavor. Many different combos to choose from so would be hard not to find a few to your taste. Seating is limited so be prepared to wait if you plan to eat there."
"Five of us took luncheon here and it was out of this world excellent. Order nearly any of two courses from the luncheon menu and be very pleased. The portions are surprisingly large and the flavor combinations impeccable. Highly complex and perfectly balanced. This chef does not miss! :) Add to that a refined but not at all stuffy service, and you have a gem in the making. I'm coming back for dinner! Highlights were scallops with butter foam, the halibut fillet, marscapone/ricotta raviolis with red wine sauce, veal parcels in a totally savory sauce, and the lobster truffle bisque. NOM!"
Simply the best.. Great ood and awesome ambience. Perfect every time we dine there!
my fav
The best Mediterranean food in NEW YORK CITY. The chef have an amazing touch so the food comes out great!!!
This place is great because they deliver and everytime I walk by its really crowded. Â Everything I've ordered from here has been hot and tasty and I really like the dips / sauces they include. Â The empanadas are cheap and the chips and salsa are yummy as well! Order 2-3 empanadas per person because they are small.
One of the best street meat in the area! I haven't been to their sit down location but i have been to their midtown location. I'm really surprised how good and different theirs is compared to everyone elses. Â My favorite however is Rafikis. I feel it s more healthy but who am I kidding? THe hot sauce is out of this world!
"What a fabulous alternative to regular sushi. Loved this place. Great food and friendly staff.We had an amazing experience here. Everything we took just tasted so good. The place is a bit small and you will need to share a table if needed, but it is one of the best Sushi places I eaten. It is indeed Sushi Beyond, basically taking Sushi to the next level of evolution."
"Really great Tarte Flambee. The crust is very thin, the combinations great! The sweet apple tarte was delicious!"
good noodles and the their pork buns are way better than momofuku's. Â the service is dizzying but.. who cares.
"OMG, came here this past weekend holiday and I have to say that I am now craving their banh mi's. Â I think they put crack in it or something cause it's so addicting!!! The beef bulgogi is hands down the best banh mi everrrr! And I can't go without their Frozen Vietnamese Coffee Mocha. Â Too damn gooood! My tummy is happy now that there is a banh mi shop in queens. Yay for JoJu!"
"Walking in on a cold fall night, it is not hard to understand why this popular Brooklyn Heights' neighborhood restaurant is a big hit. Noodle Pudding simply oozes warmth, good Italian food and friendly service. The prices are more than affordable, and you are dining in a romantic golden colored candle lit room. The menu focuses on classic dishes with an adventurous twist. The pappardelle with venison ragu was simple but yet so flavorful. Although tiramisu was ordered on every other table, and looked very yummy, at the end of our meal I was simply too full to try."
I was there for a midday brunch with a few of my friends and had a really good time. The ambiance was great although I feel the food could use more creativity and flavor. There were unlimited sangria which we were very happy about. Will definitely go back.
"Great space, and service. Â The food is well thought out with excellent presentation. Â Great place for a date or even a family function. Â Highly recommended"
"Reopened middle of last week. As a long time patron, I will just report on what is new - check out the other reviews for the general story. - 4X+ amount of space compared to old place. They knocked out at least one wall, created a seating area, all glass front to store - MUCH nicer space and now places to sit and move. - MORE expensive. That right - no more 5/$1 - now it's 4/$1 for the regular pork fried dumplings. This is really unfortunate, as this place (and Prosperity Dumpling - more below) are known as ""5 for 1"" dumpling places. A quick look at the expanded men shows the prices on other items have inched up as well. - New dumpling types. In addition to the original (Pork/chive/vegetable), they now offer shrimp dumplings and chicken & basil dumplings. Have yet to try these. If memory serves, the shrimp dumplings are 10/4$. have not tried these yet - will report back after the next visit. - New order system. Unlike before, which was a combative free-for-all to get to the counter and capture the attention of one of the cooks, then now have an order system where you order, then are given a ticket with your order printed on it while you wait for your number to be called. Judging from some of the pushy, non-English speaking Chinese regulars, they have yet to discover this new system. So, why only three stars with the new digs? Increased prices for dumplings that are not as good as Prosperity Dumpling, two blocks down the street on the same side. At Prosperity, the dumplings are 50% larger, have a thinner wrapper (less doughy), and have more of a more flavorful filling. AND - still 5/$1. Â Granted, they are still a tiny, spartan space, but Prosperity is the real deal, old school"
The fried chicken dumpling is very good! Â The price is good.
I always stop here for lunch after workout Â at Superstar gym. They also have healthy choices. Good cozy place with good service. It is more neighborhood place you can enjoy your food without tourist crowd.
"We ordered a spinach omelette and a white cream chicken mushroom crepe.(I forgot those names exactly) It was so tasty. The white cream was rich and the omlette was soft. I really recommend it. We didn't order drinks, therefore paid only ï¼„26 for them including tip. I'd like to go there again."
One of the better dumpling spots around. Â Always too crowded to get a seat to eat in.
"The place was packed when I was there for lunch but service was quick and prompt. Ordered the chicken satay, roti canai, nasi lemak, char kway tiao and ice kacang. The chicken satay was good but the satay sauce was kinda sweet and lacking the peanut taste that supposed to be with it. The char kway tiao seriously taste like what it should be minus the cockles. The roti canai taste like a chewier version of roti prata and the curry sauce that comes with it was good. Nasi lemak was also quite up to standard as the rice was fragrant with the banana leaf aroma and coconut taste. Ice kacang was excellent. Went back there again for dinner the next day and ordered seafood with egg hor fun, Hokkien mee and kangkong belachan. Service kindda slack after the lunchtime rush period and before the dinner crowd came in. The Hokkien mee taste was there but the noodle used was udon instead. They left out my order of the kangkong, so I had to ordered it again (luckily it came fast) and it was good but not spicy enough for me. Overall, I would come again."
"I have been here 3 times and every single time I have been to sugar freak I have ordered the Spicy Fried chicken, it is moist on the inside, spicy & crispy on the outside. 5 stars on the chicken. The service is mediocre, they are not as at tentative as i like them to be but as long as i get my chicken in a timely manner I'm set. Beignets good, their coffee is definitely not for me, I'm not saying it's bad i just happen to not like that consistency/flavor with coffee. Their cocktails are too sweet for me, but beer selection is nice, especially because they carry abita haze :) Overall awesome place."
this is a good place. i'm a fan and always will be.
Amazingly delicious bacon cheeseburger sliders. At first I thought they had forgotten to add the bacon until I realized that the bacon was chopped up into small bits. Genius! The onions were sauteed and piping hot. These is my go to place now for whenever I need a burger fix. Great customer service too.
"Food and service great, not good but great. Atmosphere is the question. More like a party, a loud party. Noise level so loud I could not take a cell phone call, had trouble hearing people at our table of four. I do not plan to return, however, if you like a loud party, I recommend Becco."
"Treat yourself to Luke's Lobster or go to McDonalds and act like you're happy. I tried my first lobster roll here and will definitely be back. (Maybe after a week or two of bringing my lunch and robbing banks.) My lobster schooner included an entire lobster cooked and seasoned to perfection atop a delicious buttery roll, a tiny pickle, Vickie's chips and a fantastic Maine root soda (I recommend Mandarin Orange). It was a fresh and amazing meal that was well worth $19.25."
"The place is hard to find and out of the way, but well worth it. When I ordered octopus to start, I expected it to be fresh and grilled, which it was, but it came in a spicy broth which was not only delicious, but didn't detract one bit from the crispiness of the octopus. The main course came with a surprising mix of vegetables, fruit and berries, all prepared/cooked to perfection and absolutely fresh. They do grow their own vegetables and the garden is next to the restaurant for all to see. The wine list is very, very long, nothing inexpensive, but not outrageous if you know how to look. The portions are not enormous, but big enough that I could not eat any dessert. Will try it again!"
"So delicious and it is so hard to choice a dish, all seem good !"
the Empanada here are very good and fresh (since they are always busy). Â They have a nice selection. Its good for a meal or a snack.
"It is a bit of a dive but the food is fantastic. It is located in the heart of Chinatown and is a real locals place. Very small so you may have a wait but, it is worth it.Had the spring rolls, shrimp rolls and different soups. All very good and reasonably priced. Don't expect a nice atmosphere and this is not a place for a romantic dinner, but if you love Chinese food, it is the place where to go."
Their sliders are perfect. I've had the bacon ones too and they are delicious. The chipotle ketchup is top notch too.
"Best falafal in NYC? I think so! This place a sets a new standard for falafal sandwiches. A very high standard that most falafal joints don't even come close to. I go here almost every day for lunch. This place gets very crowded very quickly for a good reason. Tons of food, tons of flavor and very affordable. Everything here is fresh, fresh, fresh! Cons: get's very busy, a little disorganized and very loud. Not a good place to go for a quiet lunch! But sooooo worth it for the food itself. Just go!"
Nice place. Â Friendly people. Â Lot's of locals and regulars. Â Good place if you live in the neighborhood.
"They have gone up in price (like everywhere else) but still come in as tasty and usually authentic Malaysian food BUT now borderline 3 stars. Good service always. Â The ""blond"" old Â guy who seems to be the manager, might consider saying hello-at least once-to regular customers."
"You don't have a lot to spend? And you want a ton of food? Well this is the spot. Literally a hole in the wall, with practically no seating and a line out the door. Prosperity Dumpling is a legendary spot out here. The women who are taking the orders are shouting to get you in and out as quick as possible. It's rude but it's the real deal. The pricing is dirt cheap and you really get your money's worth. I got the pork dumplings boiled and fried. Both were spilling out with juices. YUM! And we got the egg sesame pancake. Greasy goodness! I spent about 7 bucks and it was enough food for 4 ppl. Impressive. These are the places I love."
Had dinner with my friend the other day... Â wasn't crowded. Â I ordered the dumplings and some other dishes (I don't really know since it was my friend who ordered it). Â The only thing I would recommend to ppl is the dumpling (the crab one) - that one should rate 5 stars but the other dishes really dissatisfy me so I have to deduct 2 star. I probably will go back again coz the dumplings are really good and I'll probably order something different next time.
"Once again, AMAZING! Â Never a bad meal! Â And their Sangria... Â SO GOOD!!! Â Will return time after time."
"Have only been there once but had a delicious wine (the Priorat). Had several of the small plates. The mac was just so-so, but the lamb meatballs and Angus Beef sliders were really good. Plate of olives...nice. Wish they had some meals and not just finger food (based on the meatballs and sliders, their burgers would be great). Think about it, guys! Of course, the tab adds up for all those small plates to fill you up, so...maybe that's the idea. While it's a blessing to finally find a place with no TV (praise the lord), who invented the notion that music BLASTING is conducive to conversation?! It's a wine bar, not a sports bar...allow us to chat puh-leeze. Take the music down a few decibels so we can talk without going ""Huh?, What?"" The place will still be buzzing, I promise. (Suggestion: Maybe get some music selections that are more conducive to atmosphere and conversation.) Owner is welcoming and waitress was great. Try those lamb meatballs and Angus sliders. Leave some Priorat for me. I'll be back. (I'll raise a glass to Jayne D., who loved the Priorat on 10/27/12.)"
"They were really busy but we only had to wait 15-20 minutes, the service was good and so was the price. We had the margarita pizza and it was delicious! Not my favorite NYC pizza but It was certainly good enough for me to go back. Good place to try!"
"Great calzones ! Stopped by for a quick bite , great food!"
"You can't go wrong with Basso56. Great seafood and pasta dishes. Reasonably priced. Also, I always go to Basso when planning large parties - their long tables are perfect and you can always get a reservation (they have lots of space)."
"This is what a friend of mine meant when she said something was so good it made you want to ""get up and slap your grandma!"" Â This is great pizza! Â The char on the crust, the fresh cheese, the sprinkle of olive oil after it bakes and of course the fresh basil that is cut and sprinkled over each pie gets after it comes out of the oven. Â  You bite into what tastes like heaven. Go there with patience. Â The lines are often long, but the wait is worth it. Â Each pie is looked over with care. Â If you want quick and easy, I am sure there is a Little Ceasar's that will take your $5."
"Totally worth visiting and enjoying on vacation or a quick stop for lunch. Staff is extremely awesome at their jobs. The young lady who took our order was precise and bubbly, she also wad able to suggest adding chicken breast to one of the grilled cheese and it was oh so moist and perfect."
"The Halal Guys were an accidental food opportunity for me. I was up in mid-town to meet a client for lunch, lunch got cancelled so I met up with a colleague from work. He asked if I've had lunch - I hadn't. And he suggested the Halal guys. I've never even heard of them and my friend has been eating there since before they became popular. Good food, a good example in operational efficiency. Great value for money."
What's that? $1 for 4 dumplings? Not so Chinatown anymore my friend. Huh? Thick dumpling skin and skimped pork and chives? You must be joking WTF? Watered down bland hot and sour soup? Never again Walk 2 blocks down towards Prosperity's Dumplings for dumplings done right.
"Contrary to popular belief, the burger is nothing special."
I would give this place zero stars- I came in here and I ordered the Lavash sandwich- It came to me on a cold American wrap!! I went to the manager and I told him I asked for the Lavash- he saw my Jewish star and told me how come Jewish people complain all the time- I said excuse me and he said that I am sorry but please leave we don't like Jewish people- Then he came outside and followed me and told me that he would break my face!! Little skinny guy but he keep saying you don't know me- I was so confused I just worked 10 hours and just wanted a lavash sandwich - so strange felt like the twilight zone Because he does not like JEWISH people- Formulate your own opinions folks !!!!!
"A simple dinner gone missing. Service was terrible, food mediocre, nd the kitchen lost my dinner. Wife's dinner was so-so."
"Honestly, one of the most amazing sandwiches I've had! i cannot believe how good their pulled pork is and how good their brisket is.... side of hot sauce and their own (unique but interesting) pickles, and I'm good to go ! :)"
"A walk-up counter with a line 20 people long is worth the wait at Los Tacos No 1! The homemade corn tortilla tacos are the size of a teacup saucer filled with perfectly seasoned beef or chicken. The guacamole and chips were a perfect side. Hidden in the back of a retail space, this taco stand is the real deal. As mentioned by other reviewers, seating is limited in the market place, if you can find a table first tag team with your companion, so you will have a place to eat your messy tacos! Can't wait to return!"
"this one of the best falafells ive ever had. the pita is soft, the balls are tasty and its so cheap! one complaint is that you feel very rushed when you are ordering and the staff arent very nice....but its not so important when the falafell is so good"
Excellent pizza and good price!
"Great place for rotisserie chicken and plantains. I tried the lomo saltado here and was disappointed. The chicken is a can't miss, though. I was practically raised on that stuff."
"By far my favorite brunch spot for the weekends. The brunch menu is short and to the point & comes with complimentary bellinis, mimosas, or fresh squeezed orange juice. The lobster eggs benny is the best thing on the menu & will definitely blow your mind. The Creme brulee french toast is to die for as well. You really can't beat this in place. The only thing that sucks is the wait. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait 1-2 hrs to get seated during brunching rush hour on weekends. Totally worth it though."
"I laugh at all these clown followers standing around the corner on a 2 hour line waiting to get in to eat their trendy pizza cause they want to feel COOL. This place is not all that the pizza was cold, burnt and small qualities of toppings. Just a name and more media press to follow. Common folks show some independence not following like hipsters.... There are better places around for your buck."
Great little Korean restaurant. Â The spicy noodles were excellent and so were the bbq beef plates. Â The bibimbap was very bland and I would not recommend it. Â But everything else was delicious.
Pork Belly and ramen....there is nothing more to say. I can't wait to go back there again.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE COMING HERE! The food is incredible! Fried string beans is a must have for an appetizer and the food comes out very fast considering how busy it gets. Drinks are strong but won't kill you. Service is never lacking. If you have not already tried this place I would suggest doing so.
"Love, love, love! Came here with my GNO group and had an exceptional time. Server Bailey was so helpful and recommended a great bottle of wine. We loved our mains: lamb, venison, snapper, and a burger. All cooked perfectly. Plus, Mark Simmons came out to see how we were enjoying our meal. Classy. Â Also, he's easy on the eyes. We ended the meal with a shared pavlova. Delish!"
Unda Chicken Roll #8 & Unda Shami Roll # 12 r my fave..MMMMMMM..!!!
"I wasn't impressed with the food. I got about 5 dishes to share and only the lamb skewers and shrimp were good (but not memorable). Ambiance was great though, really nice intimate setting. I would come back here for wine on a date but not for food."
cool spot to grab dinner with a date; small + intimate. Â great food done in a simple manner. Â service is usually excellent; atmosphere is great late night. Â worth the price. Â  try to avoid going with a large groupl.
"Great food at great prices but the service is horrible. I return here every now and then only for the food. The food gets 4 stars and service gets 1. If you don't care about service you will enjoy the restaurant, but if service is important to you, steer clear."
"I havent had the pleasure of eating difaras for the past 2 months which has been terrible for me, yes thats how good this pizza is. As a pizza aficionado living in nc is tough, there is not one good pizza place. Therefore, i spend most of my time in new york. The first time I went into this place I knew it was great. Where else, can a place be this dirty and stay open? There is only one answer to that the best pizza place in the country. The 3 cheeses Dom uses on his sicilian are to die for. People, forget about the wait just judge the food. And to me, this pizza is top 5 in the country."
"I want to talk about fish because I find it to be an incredibly original restaraunt. Not the delicious cuisine, not the freindly staff, not the nantucket fishnet decor, casual atmoshpere or really anything about it. We've all had food like this in our lives, and we've all enjoyed it at a very reasonable price. What makes it original is that it's in Manhattan! CMON! I mean cmon! where else in NYC do you see all these factors get arranged together like a 12 yr old's Yemen wedding? Nowhere in NYC I can tell ya that. For some reason when Lobster is on the menu in NYC the price is that of diamonds, or a small child. I know it needs to get shipped ect ect. But take it easy man.... no lobster should cost 50+.. Bullshit. Proof of this point is FISH ON BLEEKER. Everything is reasonable, which is why it is easily one of my most frequented restaraunts. And im sure goes the same for most reviewers. You dont get to GO to seafood restaraunts frequently in the city, let alone lobster shellfish joints, simply because it is so expensive and unfilling. I dont NEED my lobster raw, or sliced 13 ways and stood up on my plate. I dont need a chili lime cilantro cream simmer.. I dont WANT IT! I dont want a 3 ounce tail ... I want the whole f*cking thing! I am a lobster eater mother f8cker! I turn it upside down when I get it. Let the juices drop to the back shell. Twist it for that soup that builds. I LIKE THE GREEN TAMALE.. I SUCK THE LITTLE LEGS! Is anyone understanding me. ITS A F*CKING SEAFOOD! God damn it KEEP that oyster case on the bar.; let me SEE the man shuck em.. PLEASE KEEP PUTTING BOWLS OF PEANUTS on the bar. make me thirsty. I DARE YA TOO! I dont care. Random fresh sea urchin.. raw? cmon man... CMON! If there is any true food lovers on this site you know getting that raw for that price is bananas! This is consistent with Fish's entire menu. NOW! YOU LISTEN YOU LITTLE SLAP STICKS! YOU TELL ME WHY DOWN THE BLOCK!!!!!!! (deep breath deep breath relax) Ed's faggidy f@g f@g f@g Lobster bar charges: 3.50 for one shrimp 3dollars for one MOTHER F*CKING OYSTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR and their Lobster is at market price. which if you did NOT know by now ""Market Price"" means ""Makeup Price"" in NYC. Market price could mean what price they are getting the lobsters for at the market. or what they are getting everything ELSE for at the market, using their highest priced item (Lobster) as an offset. Don't belive me? Don't care. Either way you'll never know cause you werent at the market. so suck it. If you havent guessed by now I go to fish cause I love it. And I will continue to go, at least once a month The food is warming in the winter and absolutley nesassary in the summer. The casual setting relaxes your ""mind on your pocket"" lifestyle, and is justified even more by the taste of the food. Fish is not gourmet. Fish is not flaky, light, dainty or romantic. Fish is like wrestling match. and you will wrestle with your food. You will have grease on your hands, sauce on your shirt, broken shells in your hair, and butter in your ass. Fish is a great time without being pretentious. And if you are a real NY'er .. not some sh*tbag who needs the place to look way better then the food is,... you will go. and you will be back. Unfortunatley I must play it fair. Outside of their wonderful specials and raw and hot shellfish selections, fish does have some shear faulty culinary aspects. Â (I have also recently been informed that an extra Lobster on a Lobster MEAL is 12... It used to be 9)This is the reason for 4 and not 5 stars. But to be even more of a common ground advecate... who gets 5 stars? Who deserves it? no one. Because surely there must be something wrong with everything. Sans philsophy, Fish's menu extended from the true heart of raw and hot shelfish fair struggles here and there. Simply put I would not stray too far off a clam bake/raw bar/lobster idea... Not that the Mahi or or Swordfish are bad. They are absolutley not....(not great though)......But its just nothing that is really coherent . Its an attempt to appease the masses, which I respect greatly..surely you need more then only 3 dimensions. So to that I applaude, but the flavors arent there. That being said. I truly love Fish. And coming from a guy who eats everything(except grape leaves.. YUK) that means something....(to me at least) FYI: unlimited blue claws for 25-35 a person? If your genitals arent tingling you might wanna get your pulse checked."
"A classic NY hole in the wall find. As already stated by many the price and food are fantastic. Â The sesame pancake is a thicker version than the usual fare found at most places and is light, not greasy and full of flavor, and its a healthly slze slice, no skimping here. Â The dumplings are fresh and flavorful and unlike some of the streetfare versions, the pork and chive filling is full of flavor with no off tasting grisely mix, and again the dumpling is generously filled. Seating is very limited and basically a bench lining the wall with a narrow shelf to eat off of. A better choice is eat outside on Â a stoop, find a park or in your car if you drive there. Just dont wait too long as the dumplings will taste best right out of the wok. The store itself is a mini cultural moment with the cook turning out hugh amounts of dumplings, both steamed and fried, from super sized woks. Â Next to him is a woman with two cleavers chopping the fillings non stop, think human version of a food processor. Â Behind her are a team of three women churning out the actual dumplings at a lightening speed pace. For anyone seeking a real food experience this is the place."
"Tried this place for the first time 2 months ago. Â I did feel that the food and service were sub-standard, given their prices. Â Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that any restaurant would provide bad food and service on purpose. Â Normally, I would give an establishment the benefit of the doubt, but in this case, there are just way too many allegations, including those of mine. Â As Gordon Ramsay says in Hells Kitchen, ""Shut it Down!!"""
"Yes, the line is long. Â Yes, the old guy takes forever. Â Yes, this is the best pizza in New York."
"yummieeeeeeeeeeieeeee. i love their grilled corn, and the catfish sandwich is to die for. Â blood orange lemonade is soooooooo good. Â they should bottle it."
"The buns are to die for, and you cannot go wrong with any of the ramen on the menu. The traditional Japanese service creates a lovely energy around the dining experience. Your water glass will never empty and the service doesn't stop until you are out of the door. It's quite the spot."
"The concretes have always been deliciously decadent, and each Shake Shack around the city has their own flavors on their menu. The staff are friendly, the lighting is warm and inviting. Shake shack has decent fries, the cheese fries really melts in your mouth but vs the in n out animal style, the competition is not even close. Â I also tried their blueberry lemonade which was good. Overall this is still a great place to eat and granted prices are higher for similar portions. Highly recommended."
"Definitely worth stopping by and eating a good sandwich here. I went solely to Chinatown to finally tackle one on Sat. Totally worth the trip. I order a spicy pork (3.75) and a spicy chicken (4.25) and a soy milk from their fridge. 8.75 in total. Not bad for lunch and dinner. I ate half of each sandwich after I bought them, then ate the other half later in the night. The ingredients and bread are fresh. One of the best banh mi I've eaten in NYC. The huge crowd of people is a displeasing sight but you'll be very surprised by how quickly they assemble the sandwiches. My friends and I only had to wait like 10 mins for our order. Speedy! I was kinda surprised they spoke Cantonese though. Perhaps they are native Vietnamese but of Chinese descent? It's possible but whatever! I'll go back again for the spicy pork and probably hold back on the chicken. I wanna go eat one NOW! :-P"
"My friend and I were intrigued by the nightly entree special, ""Little Shoes,"" (eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin), and so we decided to eat at Snack. Although very tiny, we were able to stand while we waited and have a glass of wine at the narrow 'bar.' I absolutely loved the atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed to find out that they were out of the entree special by the time we sat down. My substitute entree, Veg. Moussaka, was hearty and good, but cinnamon overpowered the other flavors. My friend had the stuffed tomato and green pepper plate, which I liked better."
"I was NOT on board with the whole fancy pizza thing-- UNTIL I CAME TO PAULIE GEE'S! This place is the best. Amazing pizza, quality service. And Paulie himself is Â almost always there, talking to the guests, being friendly, funny and welcoming. My only complaint is that I wish I lived closer to it!"
Awesome pizza. Not sure if its worth the hype.
"My one and only love. Much like my first wife, looks like a disaster from the outside but has so much to offer on the inside. Â Since raising their prices as of the last year, it reminds me of my second wife who was all about money, but still had something I couldn't refuse. Â The burger is crumb like, meaning it'll fall apart if you scarf it down too quick, but be gentle with the sandwich. Â Unless you're ordering a second one and are willing to wait in line, then my friend you are a true devotee of these babies. Â With a beer in one hand and the burger in the other, you have a combo meal fit for only the finest. Try coming here during the off hours to avoid the crowds. Â Too many folks will result in higher costs and longer lines."
my favourite pizza in the city better than anything brooklyn has to offer . This is the original and th best . The sauce is perfect a little sweet - the mozzarela is made in house and you can taste the freshness . The price is great and you can grab a beer as well .. great for groups ..
"This was a cute place, great for a large group. We called ahead and made a reservation and they were extremely accommodating. The inside looked really cute, although a little dark. The service was great, the food was good. I had the pad thai and my only complaint (along with others) was that the serving sizes were just a little too small. We were hungry a couple fo hours later. The best part was the birthday special. They brought this amazing lychee custard. Also, Chef Hong herself came out to say happy birthday. Overall, service and food were good. Serving size not great."
"Our meal at Juventino was memorable both for the quality of the food (ribeye and cod, fyi) and the service. The waiter working the night we visited was one of the most helpful we've ever had, but unfortunately, we didn't get his name. We also liked the restaurant's minimalist decor. It's easy to walk past Juventino without seeing it, however, so keep in mind that it's close to the French-style bistro Belleville, which with its red exterior is easier to find."
"Not what you would expect from the outside. Much bigger & more chique inside, but despite being large it was very very crowded when our group went on a Friday night. Waiters were a little 'hispter'ish' but did explain the food well, they were not so great on their knowledge of wines. I would recommend they take a crash course in pairings. Serving time was decent for how crowded it was (took out table of 6 about 20-25mins for starters to arrive). The food was delicious but in the $$$$ range. Budget for about $150 per person if you want a full dinner & drinks."
"I've been here twice already. The first time I went, my friend decided that on the last day of classes, we should do something after school. Someone suggested to go to the best pizza place in New York. When she said this, the first thing that came to my head was ""brooklyn"", ""J train"". However when I looked up ""best pizza in NYC"" this place came up first. When we got here, we were told we would have to wait 30 minutes to be seated, but actually got seated in 5 minutes. The pizza was delicious (we got 2 pizza, 1 with mostly meat toppings and another with all vegetables). It was totally worth the money. Every bite was savory and delicious. Can't give it 5 stars yet till I visit the Brooklyn place though!"
"Cute place but one of the worst meals I've ever had in New York. A fine place to go for a drink perhaps but I'm really confused by the positive reviews for the food. A group of us ordered several different dishes and all agreed they were among the blandest, most half-assed dishes we've ever been served in a restaurant. And we're talking pretty simple dishes that you almost have to try to f*** up. And don't even get me started about the obnoxious, coked-up waiter. So many other people have mentioned him in their reviews that I assume he's either related to one of the owners or the restaurant thinks his shtick is part of the attraction of coming here. Avoid."
"I came here expecting such great things such I had a couple friends who liked this place and said it was a good date place. I agree the decor and ambiance was great but the food was not up to par. Deviled eggs had very little effort into them- just whipped yolk with a chip and pickle on top. Had the chorizo shrimp, which was decent but not worth the price. The Vietnamese duck sandwich was horrible- flavors did not blend well at all. Lamb skewers were the only mildly redeeming factor. I will only be back here for wine, if at all."
This is the cheers of Bushwick. Everyone knows your name. The egg sandwich is heaven. The bartenders know their stuff and the music on point.
Artichoke appetizer was amazing. Rice pilaf tasted rich yet light and healthy. Wine was well paired. High quality food in a fun atmosphere. Attentive wait staff. Will definitely be going back.
"Went here for an early dinner today with my friend. Both of us god Shake Shack burgers and fries, which as another reviewer noted, are crinkle-cut and salted OK (I added pepper to mine), plus the Shake Shack lemonade (a bit too sweet for my tastes...) Portions are decent, but this place is a bit pricey considering that the fries are not exactly overflowing and the burger is only OK sized. Was here from around 6-8 pm in one of the booth seats and it was really crowded. Mixed and basically unpretentious crowd of families, friends, students, and couples hanging out and gobbling down on some American food. My only complaint is that the buns were too soft and basically soggy."
I enter into Piacere by chance. I was immediately impressed by the charming atmosphere that the italian Manager created inside. It s hard to imagine that you can find a place like this in the area of little Italy / Chinatown. The pizza margherita I tasted was definitely excellent.
Great place for seafood lovers! You might have to wait for seating but that means good food! It worth. You can't miss their grilled octopus. That is a MUST!
"great place for a late night snack but overrated. people talk about this place like what they've done is revolutionary - at the end of the day, its just fries. that being said, decent tasting fries at a reasonable price."
"I think I overdosed on empanadas today. Had the spicy chicken Â empanada (4/5 stars), tuna/jalapeno empanada (3/5), and pork arepa (3.5/5 stars). It was pretty good going down but I just felt a little sick afterwards. Not sure if it was the amount of food or the fact that this was just for lunch. I think this place is solid food but only good when eaten as a snack or a drunken meal, not an actual meal. 3 stars was also for the lack of service- took about 20 minutes to get my food and the place was pretty empty."
"I heard so much about this food truck and decided to give it a try. The food is simply the best. What's even more is it's so cheap. They serve a big portion for $6. We tried the lamb over rice and the chicken combo. Came with some lettuces as well. I ordered extra white and red sauce. Be careful, the red sauce is extremely hot. The line was a little bit long but worth every minute of waiting. You can't resist the smell of the truck. There is no seating and they only accept cash, but getting the food and walking around trying to find a place to sit and eat is part of the experience. These guys working behind the truck are very fast. They are very entertaining and make great food for a more than fair price. I am glad i tried this cart. First thing on the list when visiting New York."
"Researched the best Pad Thai in NYC and we made a special trip. Â So excited to try it (we did take out on the way to the airport) and can't tell you how disappointed we were. Â Dry noodles, very little flavor--I make better Pad Thai at home. Â Oh well."
"Scarpetta has been a name glued onto my best friend's vocabulary ever since I met her. Â  So, it was only natural for my gfs and I to celebrate my best friend's birthday at this space. Â  Given its location, in the unfortunate area called MeatPacking, I wasn't sure what type of crowd to expect. Â I'm someone close to my mid30s and hanging out 'to be seen' is something I graduated in my 20s. Â Loud men with slick hair and women in heels they can barely walk in (I endearingly call women who can't walk in their heels 'the mantis') are the general crowd even on school nights in that neighborhood, and sure enough, the bar area of Scarpetta was filled with obnoxiousness. ""Hi, I was wondering if you could squeeze me and my lady friend in...we have no reservations, but, you know who I am..right?"" Â (barf) Luckily, all that ended once we were seated in the dining area. Â And everything - EVERYTHING - changed. First of all, the service is impeccable. Given, our table did consist of beautiful young ladies (minus me - my friends are definitely hot) and maybe the waiter just felt like being super friendly to us. Â Still, he was attentive, patient and willing to explain and help us select the best meal. Â And not only was he nice - the sommelier, the bussers... they all did their jobs with smiles and humor. Â  Food was amazing. Â For appetizers we shared the Fritto Misto (there are fried anchovies in here - yum for me, but not yum for many), Burrata and the creamy polenta. Â The creamy polenta was a clear winner out of the three, but everything was delicious. Â And I think with our waiter's help, we chose 3 distinctively different dishes that played out well with each other. We shared 3 pasta dishes - the cavatelli with rabbit, the agnolotti with fonduta, and a linguine with parmigianno and sausage. Â Out of the 3, unfortunately, the cavatelli was the least favorite of mine. Â We felt that the pasta itself was too 'floury' (thick - mealy) and I felt that the rabbit was drenched in too much five-spice or some other type of gamey-flavor taste killing herb. Â  And then we had 2 fish entrees - the cod and the halibut. Â Some people might have thought that these two would be too similar and wouldn't have ordered them together. Â But, again with the help of our waiter, we had the most amazingly prepared fish dishes ever. Â They were so different from each other too - which was the nice thing about it. Â  During the entire meal, we were never rushed. Â Actually, they suggested that they had brought out the pastas too late and to compensate for that, they gave us a complimentary quartino of wine and a dessert. Â  Meanwhile, we were actually happy with the pace of the meal, since we didn't have to 'stuff; ourselves with the ginormous amount of food we had consumed. FYI, the breadbasket is an entire course of its own, filled with a variety of delicious italian breads. Â The most notable of them all is the foccacia baked with slices of salumi and cheese in it. Â We named it 'a sandwich' and even asked the waiter ""why are you guys serviing us a SANDWICH before a meal??"" Â While I would ask you to practice caution with the breadbasket because it could easily stuff you up before the actual food, i have to say... it's yummmmmmy. Definitely go hungry!!"
"The coffee was excellent though and the atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxed.They bake their treats overnight so they're fresh for the day, which I find amazing. Â I was impressed."
"I have been patiently waiting with anticipation to sample the sandwiches here. With all the Yelp love, my expectations were high. I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed. I sampled the #3, BBQ pork w a side of fries. Though the BBQ pork was not what I was expecting, both were still delicious. Because I was having a late lunch, I experienced no lengthy lines or seating problems. I do suspect on the wknds or normal lunch hours may not be so seamless. I will definitely be back to try more sandwiches and some of the teas."
Solid brunch spot
i have been eating here for a few years now. this place is delicious at 3-4am after a long night out with friends. the lamb and chicken combo is what i usually get. not really sure how to describe how good it is but the place is delicious. the only reason i am leaving 4 stars is the wait. they need to find a more efficient way to serve the mobs that show up at 3am.
A bit hard to find but worth the effort. Asian/Japanese cuisine with some emphasis on Kobe beef. The very knowledgeable server explained all dishes very patiently to a crowd of 6 (some of them picky eaters) and made selection easy. The food is excellent with great flavors and presentation making it a perfect evening. Good value. We are looking forward to our next visit.
"BrisketTown is to food as The Beatles are to music. Yes, that good. Ever felt euphoria from meat? No? Then give this place a try. They threw in a few extra ribs. I ate so much I had to go home and sleep afterwards. When I asked the guy ""no sauce?"" he replied ""nothing to hide."" He was right."
"We went late and everyone was very friendly. The octopus starter should not be missed - excellently prepared with great compliments in the composition. The pizza was great, the gnocchi was even better, and they help you find the right wine by the glass for the night."
This is WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT!!! Bonnie's is the best. Â Nothing I could write could ever describe how well deserved all the praise is for this fantastic little place. Â Diners all around NYC should aspire to be like Bonnie's. Â You could have no taste buds and still find the food here to be incredible.
Was amazing 7 times I went over there in the course of 1.5 years Â ... lately ... going down with quality Â very sad.
everything is delicious.
"The food is so good and really cheap. I highly recomment the quarter chicken with mango salad. However, the service isn't great. Also, it gets really crowded and they don't take reservations, so I typically go for lunch to avoid waiting."
"this place is AWESOME... i used to live in the neighborhood and really wish this place was around when i was there. Â i recently went here for drinks and ended up staying for a meal and more drinks. Â the beer selection was great and full of beers i was very interested in trying. Â the bartenders seemed knowledgeable and helpful. Â there is no table service which was fine because i wasn't looking for a sit-down restaurant. Â I had a few delicious beers and then got an order of the fries and the grilled cheese, which they knocked out of the park. Â then i had a couple a whiskeys from an impressively long bourbon list. Â the atmosphere is great, felt like brooklyn which is where i am living now. Â  all together this place was great and i and i will definitely be back"
"I wish I owned Grimaldi's. Â Lines out the door and cash only. Â Nice. What's not to like about this place? The setting right under the Brooklyn Bridge is awesome, the pizza is fantastic. Not much elbow room and the waits can be excrutiating, but who cares? And you can get kick-ass ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory after gorging yourself on a delicious pie. Polish waiters, Mexican pizza makers and an Italian owner. The Pope would be proud."
"Take this review with a grain of salt because...I am an ardent carb-aholic. There! I said it. I've hustled for a supple loaf of SourDough. I beg friends for their un-eaten pizza crusts. I would do things frowned upon by society just for Bedoiun's pitas. They are that good. My allegiance to this place is built mainly from my take-out patronage. Being vegetarian, this is one of the few places in the area that offer interesting, non-meat, non-noodle/rice options AND tastes fresh. The spinach and cheese pita pocket is awesome. So is their hummus and babaghanoush. My usual order consists of the aforementioned pita pocket, Â a 5-""salad"" platter (which always includes the spinach and chickpeas and faol) and the the falafel platter. This combination never fails, and I highly suggest that you do the same."
The service was great and the waiter was very helpful. The atmosphere is very pleasant but very noisy. Food was very good; ambice felt very trending tables small and too close to each other. Service was fast and attentive. The experience was different from I usually dine but I will be back.
"Loud, dark and totally average food."
"Call me what you like, a hater, a nay sayer....First time I went to Grimaldi's was about 15 years ago, it was amazing....on my most recent visit, about 3 months ago - the product is seriously not what it used to be. Yes I think they have a good pizza, best in brooklyn FAR FROM IT it's simply not what it used to be....but my word wont affect the lines, or their success - people will still follow the reputation"
"I've been here a few times now and I REALLY don't get it. The broth was weak, the pork buns were dry, and the brussel sprouts were drenched in a sweet fish sauce. Â Go to Dassara or Ganso instead. On a positive note, the noodles and kale salad were good and the space is nice."
Never fails... Always on point mmmmm.. Chicken taboon is delicious.. Love the gyro with pita Turkish salad lettuce onions and tzaziki soooooo good!!!!!!!! And baklava for desert
"Came here again after the amazing sandwich last night.... and it was even better tonight. Â Hats off TURKO My old review below !!Turko was a nice find, I stopped in last night and had the chicken shawarma sandwich, it was unbelievably good. Â Cant wait to go back. Â  Thumbs up Management. 2 guys at the counter were great, the one actually grabbed me in from outside as I was looking in the window. Thank you !!!!"
"Despite the long waiting, I'm a regular here. The best time to go try their epic ramen is probably after 10pm on weekdays, so you only wait for 30 mins or so. The line's just consistent, never even thought about going there as a big group, although they have a very spacious eating area for a ramen place. I know it's crazy but it's that good. I would just wait & hang at the bar meantime, their ramen's worth the waiting."
"Two of us arrived today (Saturday) at 12:45pm. Â I counted 30 people waiting ahead of us, and my name was about halfway down the second page when I signed up for the wait. Â We were called in half an hour later and were out again in another 20 minutes. Â I counted 10 seats at the counter and another 10 at the handful of tables, so our wait made sense. We both ordered the Spicy Ramen with Char Siu Pork and the Avo Tuna. Â The tuna was placed in front of us within several minutes, three pieces decent seared rare tuna with avocado slices and a savory sauce. Â Soups followed no more than two or three minutes later. Â The additions of egg and mushrooms probably weren't necessary in light of the quantity, but it all worked together quite well: Â well-balanced broth, spicy enough to notice but nowhere to the point of making sweaty me feel particularly hot, somewhat fatty but tender pork, bean sprouts, and impressively al dente noodles. Well aware of the C-grade for cleanliness, we didn't mind ""risking it"" and didn't see the kind of grime or creepy crawlies that the rating suggests. Â It's a cramped little shop, yes, but one that seemed just fine with food prepared in plain view of everyone. Â Will I go back this winter or would I wait more than 45 minutes? Â Probably not on both counts, but a tasty break from the normal Saturday brunch that's well worth checking out."
"Small but a very cute place. Nice for a date. They have a cigar roller sitting in the corner making fresh ones. The food is good and you do feel like your in cuba for a bit. The meats and cheese plate was my favorite, I am a big fan of charcuterie. The staff was friendly and attentive. They had a guitar and conga player when I was there which was kinda nice."
"Pretty good pizza! Â I can't really complain much about it except sometimes you might need to wait a little bit to get a seat. Â I don't think its really that big of a problem most of the time. Â If you go at lunch time usually it's pretty easy to get seating. Â From what I remember, this place just accepts cash."
"4.5 Stars Really enjoyed my dinner here. Â I took off 1/2 a star because of the long wait, but in the end, it was well worth it. ABC Kitchen is a great little place. Â The bar is quite small, with only 5 stools. Â The restaurant is open and airy. Â Lots of white (tables, chairs, walls) with some deep browns from the wood beams. Â Love the large windows in the front. We started off sharing the Chicken Liver Toast which was AMAZING. Â The velvety smoothness of the chicken liver and the crispy, crunchy toast were great together. I ordered the Lobster and it was delicious. Â It was served with a wonderful oregano, chili lemon vinaigrette which did not overpower the lobster. Seared Artic Char was really good. The Char was prepared perfectly and the roasted cauliflower and salsa verde complimented it perfectly. Sauteed Corn with Manchego, Jalapeno and Lime was the perfect side dish! We ended dinner with the Seasonal Doughnuts, which were served with a warm peanut sauce. Â PERFECT! The service here is really good and I do love the atmosphere here. Give it a try!"
"I guess they finally release the recipe for the white sauce! Apparently its just watered down mayo but soo goooddddd!!! But common guys you really need to be drunk to be eating this stuff, not sober. I do not want to hear about anyone eating here and not having a good experience cuz they were sober. this is drunk food."
"Great food but was a little loud for my taste. I went here with my old friend that lives in the area. We had a nice time. The food was very good, though a little spicy, and I had a very nice glass of wine. I would be happy to come back here the next time I am in the neighborhood."
Good place for Shanghi food.
"It does not get better than this. I've eaten here about ten times and every time I have spent the following week dreaming about the dish that I had. Â Everything is so fresh and cooked right in front of you if you sit in the older more 'relaxed' section, which I always do. BYOB is a major plus. The owner is a character to say the least which just adds to the charm of the whole place."
"food was delicious. place was kind of empty on a weeknight, i assume this is primarily Â a ""brunch"" place. nice service. would go again."
Five stars for the best burrito in NYC this place ROCKS.....
Some of the best thin crust pizza I've had in NYC.
"I had the Artichoke Dip, Â Mac and Cheese and the Mustard Greens while here. Â The Mac and Cheese was bland and just not satisfying. Â The Mustard Greens were so salty that I ended up mixing them with the mac and cheese to combat their blandness but it was no help. Â  The artichoke dip was the only thing that saved this place from a 1 star review."
"Insanely good, cheap Best bahn mi I've ever had. Quick and free delivery."
"As it was said in I Love You Man...""This place is the tits"". I have been here a multitude of times and I really enjoy it. Everything that you order is terrific."
"This is a very unique place, if you are looking for a good time and spicy shrimp with caribbean cocktails! This is the only place to go. Try the coconut rice with any cocktail!"
"I have been to Malaysia and ate the real baba nyonya cuisine so I can really say this restaruant is as close to it as it gets to the real thing! The place is big and noisy like a sort of oriental canteen but the food is fantastic! The spicy dishes are as spicy as they should be, the flavours are strong and the portions huge! We ate a lot as the dishes on the menu sounded really mouthwatering: soup and spicy chicken were fantastic."
"Everything about this restaurant is wonderful - amazing food, great service, nice ambiance and very affordable. Place is small and cozy. Service was quick and friendly. Super fresh, delicious Mexican food, goat meat taco was an unusual treat. My favorite meal whilst I was in NY. Definitely a great find."
"Love this place.. Food is good drinks are great.. Everything in the menu is delicious. Great customer services. We ordered the empanadas to start which I recommend to everyone who is there. They were so delicious and had a mouthwatering taste. For the platos Fuertes, we ordered the Paella Valenciana, which was AMAZING. Being Spanish myself, I am always the first to judge everyone Else's so called paella but Yuca definitely know how to make a good one! My friend had ordered the Puerquito Cubano which was just as good. The meat was so tender it was falling apart and full of flavor! Overall it was a good place to get some decent Mexican and some strong drinks!"
Just went again to this top notch sushi restaurant. Â Need to be ready to spend a lot of money but it's worth it! Â Sushi is extremely fresh.
"We have been here number of times, and kept thinking that we had to review this place because they continue to deliver exceptional service, exceptionally unique and delicious food, and surprisingly casual atmosphere that the whole family can enjoy and relax. I ordered Lamb sandwich that was featured on Food network, and my husband ordered eggplant sandwich. They were incredibly tasty, and we didn't even want to finish. This time, we brought our 2 year old and the staff were very accommodating by giving us spacious seat, making plain pasta that's kid friendly. If anybody asks me where to eat that has great food and great atmosphere, I will recommend Locanda Verde. Even though they are well known for their brunch, their lunch, dinner are equally amazing!"
Mmmm mmm good
"I like this place. It's hard to find decent Greek restaurants in Manhatten. Most of them are totally overpriced and/or not really authentic. This place is different. It's like stepping into someone's home. Maybe it's because the manager/owner took some time to treat us like his personal guests. He explained the different open Greek wines on the menu and really guided us well through the experience. It's also a very cozy spot, very warm and comfy, not like these big mid town Greeks. The food was very good, just simple well executed Greek standards. We will return soon. A true neighborhood gem."
"Pretty good food at very, very reasonable prices. I've been there a few times now and it's worth the slightly longer walk from work to grab lunch or a snack here. My favorite thing right now is probably their curry + fried chicken cutlet over rice--unlike a lot of places in the area the chicken actually has some meat to it and isn't paper thin. And the curry?--Well, nothing special, it's your typical mild Korean curry, but we are talking about a place that's a ""taste of home,"" so no complaints here. Their kimbop is alright, one of (if not THE) cheapest places to get kimbop around here, though I've had better quality wise. Try not to get kimbop too far outside of the lunch and dinner rush times as it can get dry from sitting in that cold case. My absolute staple favorite here? Their $1 (or included with their lunch box sets) simple green salad. They have this super garlicy sweet vinegar (? correct me if I'm wrong on the vinegar) dressing that I absolutely looooove, though I will say I keep a roll of mints on hand for after that snack =D. So in summary-- good food that I would make at home, though coming during rush hours is best for food quality and freshness."
"Came here for brunch and Â was pleased to find a place that had a good vibe and a menu that showed creativity beyond the usual fare found at most places. What was nice is that the dishes werent creative just for the sake of being different they really showed culinary skills and thought behind them. A small but comfortable place and friendly servers. Service is on the relaxed side so if you're in a rush you wont be happy but if you want a nice leisurely conversation and meal this is the place. Coffee is good and strong and they also serve a variety of health juices. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food,which is primarily organic, farm to table and clearly identified as to source. I had the Â truffle egg bread and it was delicious, my friend had the scrambled egg with salumi, equally tasty. Â Plan to return soon to try their dinner offerings."
Had a mushroom pie and a Captain Lawrence beer. Â Excellent!
"Came here for early Mother's Day dinner, the staff is friendly and nice. The portions are just right and all dishes we've had are not bad, just a little too strong for my liking. The chicken francese and the caprese pasta was good. Will come back occasionally, to try the rest of the menu. Love the panna cotta -vanilla bean for dessert.The lights inside are Â too dim!"
"Fantastic. Wonderful food, awesome service and a friendly and romantic ambiance. Â I've been here on dates, special occasions, (their feast of 7 fishes prix fixe at Christmas was amazing) and for brunch with my mom and the service and food are always consistent. Â It's a smidge pricey for Astoria, but not so much that you want to die when the bill comes. Â  I honestly couldn't ask for more from a local spot."
This is one of my favorite places to go. The Charmoulla Chicken Tagine and Greek Salad is like a once a week regular meal. Generally the staff is friendly and awesome i took off a star because this last weekend we went there was a totally incompetent RUDE hostess who was not only clueless but rude to my friends child.
"Great food, i mean really great food! The problem is that this place is not the best place to enjoy the food, it is relatively small, and the best decision you can make, is to pick the food, and enjoy it at home, some place else. Give them a try, you will thank me ;))"
"HI. I am TANIA from PRIVE EVENT PLANNING feel free to text me at 347-303-9549 to get VIP ADMISSION with me at SKYROOM nightclub FRIDAY night, ASIA from THE PUSSYCAT DOLLS will be PERFORMING! Also feel free to STORE MY NUMBER and NAME because I plan some of the BEST PARTIES IN NYC."
Amazing! Â  Â I think I've tried just about everything on the menu I go so often. Â Yesterday I had the steak & eggs (poached to perfection) with a kale salad and it was delicious! Â The food & service keep me coming back every week. Â The people there are super friendly & know a lot of their customers by first name. It's in a great location a block from Lafayette stop off the C train. The menu is diverse & has great options for people who have dietary restrictions...the gluten free pastries are the bomb!
"This restaurant was quite a pleasant surprise. We were introduced to it by friends. The food is sensational, the prices fair, and the wait staff as accomodating and pleasant as one would expect on a luxury cruise liner. The menu is varied and there are numerous specials, memorized by the wait staff in minute detail. I have to admit it is a bit long to listen to so many specials and you kind of get lost in the midst of this recitation, but it is without question one of my favorite Italian restaurants. The ravioli, of all types is light and perfectly prepared and presented. The stuffed veal is spectacular."
I've been coming here for most of my life. Â Simply enchanting. Â An outdoor table is perfect on a summer morning.
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Drinks were delicious and it's so much fun to help create them yourself. The bartenders were interesting, helpful, and friendly. Although they make ""artisan"" drinks, they're not snobby douchebags like you'd expect them to be. The bar is so pretty too, and the small plates we got really hit the spot."
"Lovely place, great atmosphere...wonderful selection of wine. Â Waitstaff is classy, knowledgeable and non-invasive. Â  Have only tried a couple of small bites, very good. Â Sat in the window with a friend on a Sunday at 4P and it was lovely to have a great glass of wine and watch the world go by. Â Although wines are not inexpensive, you are sure to try something you haven't heard of before and love it."
"Wow... so far it's another overrated white-washed fusion restaurant. Puffer fish: tasted like cheap fish or old fried shrimp. they added to the side some phony ja ja myun sauce and weird veggie noodle. The apple kimchi should have been made with real kim chi (they served it with BACON???) and their real kimchi was REALLY salty and the sauce was thick. Momofuku Ssan is a korean fusion restaurant with white chefs which (ahem) already says something BUT the drinks were good :) oh yeah, the much heralded pork bun was not bad. I should have gotten oysters but the puffer fish stopped me. If you really like Korean food, this place is sh*t. But I'd totally come back for drinks. OH, real bummer. they don't have kimchi bloody mary's anymore! that was the main reason why I chose this joint."
"Amazing. This place has delicious selections. Their squares are legendary. Oddly enough though though their round slices are terrible. But besides that, great place."
The chicken here is not to be believed. I absolutley love it. The biscuits are incredible and dessert was off the charts. You get you rmoney's worth here. The wait is definitley worth it you won't be dissapointed at all. The best friend chicken hands down.
"Great spot to finish up a night of drinking. Brothers Grimm is a classic. Can get a little wild late at night, but that's part of the charm"
Nice date spot. Dimly lit with good food and live music on some nights. Has a garden too
"I am sorry about these stars (or lack thereof). I really really wanted it to be good. So badly, in fact, that I visited TWICE. I CREATED A YELP ACCOUNT JUST TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS. That is how baffled I am at this moment. Once for dinner - I got the Caesar salad which was DRENCHED in dressing and made me feel disgusted after a few bites - my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles which was equally disgusting (the waffle was incredible dense and flavorless). Oh, and did I mention our food took a full 50 minutes? Our waiter pretended to be upset and I think he comped out appetizer of fried pickles. Second time: I was baffled that the line was STILL so long after being so underwhelmed, but my friend insisted we go for brunch. Alright - maybe I had ordered wrong, yes? I mean, they're known for biscuits. And really, who can mess up an egg-biscuit-cheese sandwich? Welp. Apparently they can. ""Fried egg"" it was not - more of a briefly heated gooey mess. And a pile of cold shredded white cheddar. None of it melted because the dish was so cold. And the biscuit was totally lifeless and underwhelming. Even worse, the ketchup left a water trail on my plate. PEOPLE PLEASE STOP WAITING IN LINE FOR THIS OVERRATED CRAP. There are so many other worthwhile restaurants in this city - stop being confused by the long lines. It's just not good."
"Diverse crowd, friendly staff, great bar. cheap drinks. tasty food. cozy atmosphere. Â  recommend!"
good price and food
Spicy authentic thai food!
"not a fan. ordered the ceviche it was absolutely disgusting. why are there pickled green beans and overly smoked cherry tomatoes in the ceviche? also, we ordered a peach and plum market salad with cheese. when it came to the table, the peaches were missing. we were later told they were out of peaches. why wouldnt this be relayed beforehand? chicken pot pie was good. NOT worth fighting all the tourists in Chelsea market to eat here. Food must be directed towards a less sophisticated tourist palette. our dinner was $100!!! WHAT? Youre better off at some of the way better restaurants in the area."
I am Â in love with this place!! the food is outstanding and very cheap. The staff are very nice a nd add to the coziness of the place. the place is a big tourist attraction so the lines are so long but its worth the wait.
"Exquisite modern dÃ©cor, splendid service and sparkling world class food at a very fair price. In addition, a fairly priced and quality wine list impressed this oenophile. A restaurant for adults as you can actually hear yourself and your fellow diner as you converse with each other."
"The place is a cool and hip. PSYCHE! just kidding. but it is a nice place to be. the ambiance is relax and chill. Â I always order the chicken sandwich with blue cheese and franks hot sauce. Â With every order you get a house salad. Â The sides are rather cheap but AWESOME. Â I havent really tried the bar or different drinks, but the few that i had Â were good. also the waiting staff there is very polite, courteous and nice. Â they always come and check up on you. Â atleast the times i have been there. Â best time to go is before 5 pm weekdays especially if you want some alone time with your special someone. me and my girlfriend go here about once every 2 weeks. so relaxing. go here and try everything. Â  i always leave happy. OMG i almost forgot. they have CHEESE FILLED CROUTONS FOR SALADS!!!!! ..... nuff said."
"expensive as hell but what do you expect, really? the ny hanger steak is too incredible. oysters are awesome, lots of different minuette options. bread is delicious. cocktails are top notch. can easily spend like 4 hours there just sitting and experiencing a beautiful meal. a must go."
"This place is good, and I always appreciate these kind of hole in the wall restaurants that remind me of good eating in Asia. I went here with my boyfriend and we split a Grand Slam. Yes, there was more than enough food for both of us, +2--The chicken and pork katsu were probably the best I've had on this side of town (though honestly that's not saying much, the katsu around here generally sucks), +1--the curry was...good, though a good deal blander than I remember it while in Japan, +1--there was not nearly enough curry for how much rice and meat was there, -1. In in general, this place is *good* and I certainly wouldn't say no if asked there, though I don't know if it's good enough that it would jump out at me when I'm deciding where to go for lunch"
SO GOOD
"I've been to this place several times. Â Heaping plates of delicious Japanese curry plus a very inexpensive price tag equals a fantastic meal. Â Also, love the Hideki Matsui memorabilia around this place."
"I came here because my friend Mel was having her bday celebration here. Everyone has been here before but this was my first time. I was super excited because i've only heard good things about this place. We got the chef's platter and GOD Damn i thought Eh.. this isn't going to be enough. WRONG it was ENOUGH. The best thing that came out was the Pork Belly. But everything was amazing. We had Duck, Tongue (which i wasn't a fan of but it's because i don't like gamey tasting foods), Sweetbreads (i was really surprised that i liked.. they tasted very similar to McDonalds chicken nuggets... odd), watermelon gazpacho, berry salad and a ton of desserts. But the best dessert was obviously the bacon donuts. They were amazing. I also tried this unfiltered beer that was ridiculous. Went well with everything we ate. So if you have to pick a spot to eat in Williamsburg this is it!! You don't want to miss any of the food that comes out of that kitchen."
"in short: delicious, not-to-adventurous food in quintessential west village cuteness. the wait: Â no wait at 7:30 on a thursday for a party of 3 to eat: sliders: the perfect appetizer when shared skillet braised calamari with spinach and lardo croutons: this was just ok, wouldn't order again ricotta cavatelli with fava beans, tomato broth, and bacon: delicate, straightforward and utterly edible. halibut with shrimp, escarole, and lobster ravioli: perfectly cooked halibut, lovely broth, could've done without the ravioli (lobster was tough). PORK CHOP!!!: i love you, pork chop. Â perfectly pink, succulent, flavored with fennel seed and accompanied by butter beans, arugula and fennel. Â  cookie plate: normally I think biscotti is a waste of space, but the biscotti here is outstanding; served warm and tasting of anise, i could eat a whole plate of them. everything was perfectly seasoned-- there wasn't a single thing we had that needed salt or more of anything. to drink: we had a bottle of red from northern italy near the german border, forget the name but it was delicious and $50. downsides: Â really loud and kinda spendy, but the price is about right for the caliber of the food and the location."
"One of my favourite chinese restaurants in New York chinatown, whether for a full meal or just a snack. Had dined here several times and enjoyed the roasted duck and pork, lobster fried noddles and a variety of congees. They are about as close to what you can find as in Asia though not as refined."
"Place is nicely designed, a bit cold, but overall get an B+! Service was mediocre, although the food is solid!"
"Absolutely worth it! The broth is incredible, and if you sit at the bar you get to watch the chefs work. Service was friendly too. Definitely coming back!"
"I wanted to love this place. Ordered blueberry pancakes, chicken and waffles and tater tots. The chicken and gravy was way too bland in my opinion. I'm used to Roscoe's where the gravy is flavorful and oozes then delicious essence of simmered onions and the chicken is perfectly fried. The pancakes were a little weird tho they get a plus for using real blueberries. Tator tots were interesting. Not what I expected (the looked like hush puppies) but grew on me."
great tasting asian fusion food with very small portions. note: does not take reservations. incredible flavoring. meat was amazing
Love the Grocery. Â The Duck is great!
"The portion was decent, but I only ate half (thankfully). The chicken was under seasoned...the whole meal was a disappointment."
The quaint neighborhood restaurant was a little jewel. We all ordered something difference and all were magnificent. The Pork Chops with fennel was a Mediterranean delight. We arrived and our table was not quite ready. They sat us out side and offered us wine in Tea Cups. That was the beginning of a delightful evening that we all will look forward to coming back to.
"Def some of the best pizza I've ever had, thin crust, it melts in your mouth, fresh toppings... but I waited in line for almost 2 hours! I think anything would have tasted good after waiting for so long. Â I would love to give it 5 stars but the wait was just too long, and the inside was super cramped."
"There was a crowd at the entrance when we showed up, while there was none at the adjacent Chinese restaurants, so that was a good sign. We signed in, and after a 20 minute wait we were seated at a table of nine, along with a party of three. Although we weren't expecting this, we found it fun. Promptly we were served drinks and pork Dumplings which is their signature appetizer. We followed with soups and entrees of beef and fish. The service was quick, the food was average Chinese, nothing to boast about. The place is noisy, with crowded seating. Overall we had a good time, and it was a good value."
"love the food!! it is amaizing that it all comes out from their Tiny kitchen... i have tried it a few times, they nailed it any time!"
This place is forgettabouttit.
"I went here for brunch with two of my girlfriends and we had a blast. The only issue was actually getting a seat. We had to wait forever outside. It was ok so it was a nice day, but the wait was well over an hour. I know Jay-Z and Beyonce went there and all, but don't they go to a bunch of other places too? Not really sure why that is a big deal, but oh well! Anyway, we got to sit outside and it was a gorgeous day. The waitress was really sweet but not very present. It did take a bit of work to get my bloody mary, but it was worth it. :) The food was absolutely delicious, but very small. (This girl knows how to chow down). I got one of the egg dishes but was furious with myself when I saw the pancakes walk by. They looked incredible. Nice meal for a nice day. If you have time to relax and hang out for a table, then by all means, make your way over."
"This is the best Brooklyn sushi place. Â Most of the neighborhood sushi restaurants are fair at best. Â However, the Iron Chef provides reasonable pricing, nice cozy atmosphere, good music and great food. Â You cant go wrong by giving this place a try."
"Drinks are great! Food is ok! Crowd is graciously mixed! Overall, a good experience."
"Came here about a month ago with a buddy who was in NYC on business from out of town. I live here and had never been, so we thought we'd give it a shot. We both ordered the burger, as we heard it was the restaurants ""go-to"" menu item. I would give the burger a 3/5 -- definitely not the best burger I've ever had, but not the worst either. I can't remember exactly, but I think it cost ~$25, which is pretty standard for a nice burger at an NYC restaurant. All-in-all, I would come back, and would order the burger again. For those of you who are interested, the Spotted Pig is a ""sister restaurant"" of the Ace Hotel. In my opinion, the Ace Hotel's burger blows the Spotted Pig's away (it's a lamb burger vs. beef like @ Spotted Pig)."
"Really excited about having a new joint in the neighborhood that does pizza and mussels, two of my favorites! Â And does them well. The space is really pretty. I just wish they had booze. I heard they have a backyard. Didn't see it the night I was there, but my waiter said they'd only been open two days, so maybe they're still working on it. All and all, a really nice addition to the neighborhood."
"The Chef's Table offers the most personal dining experience I've yet to encounter. Food done to perfection, attention to detail unseen anywhere in Brooklyn! If you have a special occasion or just want to have a wonderful and memorable dining experience, go to the Chef's Table and sit back and enjoy."
"Welcome to the neighborhood Wheated! Came during the soft opening saturday and can't wait to go back. The decor is really cool, the pizzas are fantastic and creavtively named after some surrounding neighborhoods (the brighton beach bacon is heaven). The bar is eclectic and versatile . The bartenders mentioned to someone i was with that they all the components of their hand crafts drinks are made in the house (simple classic cocktails similar to Clover Club). Very classy and unique for the area. The guy and girl behind the bar had great chemistry together and were on point. The servers were very friendly and kept it all under control despite the rush. This was by far the most organized opening I have seen. Just to warn everyone now: get there early. They ran out of pies pretty early and I can see that being a constant occurance (we got one of the last pies ha ha ha). Again, welcome home Wheated!"
"4 of us ate here and all enjoyed our food which included a Filet Mignon, Chicken Boiled in Vinegar, Grilled Salmon and the Seabass Special. We were unable to eat dessert due to the Portion Sizes which were very large. We enjoyed a lovely bottle of Nero Sicilian Red Wine."
"Delicious burgers, ordered the chili burger. Â The fries are crispy and salty . The waitress was nice enough to give me three refills on the soda I had ! Â Weird that the place looks like a bar but food is great quality ."
"We stumbled upon Ngam as we were wandering down toward the East Village on a Friday night. Â It had some good looking specials on the board outside and smelled great so we decided to stop in for a quick dinner and were not disappointed. Â Ngam has yummy seasonal dishes and quick, friendly service. Â The decor is modern and industrial with exposed brick walls and an open kitchen in the front of the restaurant - it's much nicer than your typical Thai restuarant, and it's great for groups with their long wooden tables. Â The soft shell crabs had great flavor but were a bit heavily deep fried. Â The fresh oysters with a spicy thai sauce were fantastic and their pad thai was pretty solid. Â Also, the cocktails were very refreshing, though not the strongest. Â All in all, Ngam is a solidly good, nicer Thai spot in the East Village if you're looking for a place to go with a group of friends. @datenitenyc"
"It's basic Chinese , why is the line so long. Must be over 200 other restaurants in Chinatown serving the exact same menu. I had the flounder and cold sesame noodles. I would recommend don't order this but I don't eat pork. Most other dishes here have pork including the dumplings. Can't they make a vegan dumpling? No not here. And it's cash only. What really annoyed me is that joes has a grade B for cleanliness. I will try other places in Chinatown. This one is for tourists only."
"My wife told me to give it three stars, and in many ways she's right, but then I'd have to rethink my whole rating system and I'm too full. Ok for starters, the service was good when we were there. Some reviewers have obviously had bad experiences but not us. The ambiance is great, especially when juxtaposed against midtown, which is like hell for me. The meal was mildly expensive, $200 including tip for two with no true entrees, but I guess this is New York, so whatever. The food. Yakitori was at worst mediocre, and at best really great. the chicken meatballs, the chicken heart, the shishamo, the chicken negima with green onion and the eringi mushroom were all outstanding. the rest was ""meh..."" the homemade tofu cooked in a hotpot was really great. oh yeah the quail egg for dipping was awesome. They grill over bincho-tan charcoal. I would highly recommend that any fans of yakitori, or chicken for that matter, Â go here."
"I had the shrimp + jalapenio grits; was okay but the shrimps were overcooked. Was there for a large party, average meal. For this price point there are many other great restaurants in the city."
Yum Yum Yum!!
"The wait is ridiculous but it's worth it. You couldn't possibly go there without expecting a wait. On my visit, the service was OK as the waiter didn't seem to realize that he was serving us and we sat idly for a while, hoping for someone to notice us so we could try the famous Roberta's. I finally got his attention and from then on he was great. The food was spectacular, really great, a wonderful pizza and calzone. So much dough was consumed that I couldn't eat breakfast the next day. Can't wait to go back and take my friends."
"I loved this place. Â I knew I would. Â It's almost always packed (and it's always open! 24hrs), and it's got such a solid inspired menu. Â Brunch here erday! Â Breakfast stuff that is almost funny to read on the menu and kicks ass on the palate. Â Staff full of complete characters, but they don't suck at their jobs and you don't care if they take a little longer, this is a fun place to sit back and have drinks and eat and if you're not from NYC you should come here. Â I don't care who you are."
"I was more toward 3 stars, but the service took me over, the food is not that great but I ordered only a few things and I came before dinner hours so I think I will give it a try another time. But the service is awesome, or that particular bartender who also took care of our table, he was very sweet and accommodating and very attentive. I think I would just go back for this, but don't tell my husband;)))"
"Let our conversation now be without precedent in fact or literature, each one speaking to the best of his ability the truth to the best of his knowledge: Â Moto is, patiently, a damned fine meal Â How can I go on, I cannot. Oh just let me flop down flat on the road like a big fat jelly out of bowl and never move again! Nothing to be done."
"Really solid breakfast/brunch joint. Although it gets crowded,they are pretty hospitable. One of the few places I'm sure to take my friends from out of town."
"Very authentic Chinese restaurant. The first thing the waiter said to us was, "" how many orders of dumplings do you want""? I guess we were screaming tourist and he knew that is what we would order. It's different to sit at a table with strangers, but that made the experience all that much more fun. The place is tiny, so they rush to get you in and out quickly. Cash only."
Great pizza but they need to hire more people. It takes forever to get a slice. Will be back when its a little slow
"Delicious delicious delicious! The crispy cauliflower is amazing. Definitely get the hummus (probably the most popular snack here) and the fried olives - great snacks while you are waiting for your courses. The seafood (shrimp and scallops) were very yummy and cooked perfectly. Like other reviewers, I wish the serving sizes had been a little larger. I would also make a reservation on the weekends. We happened to walk in early on a Saturday evening and they had two tables open; if we had waited any later, we wouldn't have gotten a table!"
"When I feel like venturing beyond Hell's Kitchen and outside of my borough, I head over here for Thai food. Â They are generous with their portions, and their curries are great and seasoned with adequate amounts of spices and coconut milk - whenever I take my leftovers out of the fridge, everything is congealed. Â Ask the waiter/waitress for extra water, because you will need it if you ask for your dishes to be spicy."
Lebanese delights in a warm atmosphere. Wafa himself is circulating the dining room at all times to make sure everyone is happy. His mom is the delightful chef and in a few visits you become like a welcomed guest in their home. Go - you'll be glad you did!
"Great pie, split one for a good price. No nonsense service. Just order an it's out in minutes. Great views outside over the river too. Waited an hour to get inside but I'd do it again."
"This was the only restaurant where the service was so bad I wanted to leave. Â I remember eating at the Blue Ribbon in SoHo years ago, there is no way these places are related!"
This place is yummy and cute
Solid seafood. The fried calamari is my fave.
Pizza heaven you have never had pizza till you had Mr.demarco
If you are looking for a fast food (or just for a good falafel) drop your usual place and stop here! The hummus and pita co. is making delicious falafel sandwich that you can customize yourself. Sesame sauce is delicious. Try the babaganous or grilled eggplants as you filling. Sweet potatoes fries are ok.
"Had a super meal her at start of July. There was a 30 minute wait and the guys tried to get us seated earlier. When we got seated at a table near the bar I asked if we could wait to get a table in the main part of the restaurant and the guys were very accommodating. They checked how long it would be and got us seated within 5-10 minutes. Service was very good and the menu extensive. The girls went for the duck confit, which was huge, tasted great and was a big hit. I went for the daily special, the Pork chop, which was lovely but I must admit I was jealous of the girls. Also saw the steaks at the table next to us and they looked fab. The wine list was a bit expensive (but so are most in New York.) however we got a great Beaujolais for under $30. The atmosphere in the restaurant was fabulous. Busy, plenty of noise from chatty diners and tables all around you. Great for people watching, all sorts of parties in the night we were there. Would definitely go back."
"I tried to goat thali as per the rec of another yelper. Needless to say, they were spot on- the meal was fantastic and more than enough for one person. There were about 6 side dishes accompanying the goat curry. A lentil dish, bamboo shoots, rice yogurt milk, curried anchovies and two unidentifiable yet deliciously spicy sides. The goat itself wasn't anything too special but it was no doubt a good enough dish. Meat was a little sparse but it didn't matter too much with so many sides. I was very impressed with my meal and will definitely come back to try more."
"It's not often that you can have a delicious dinner at a reasonable price in Manhattan. Friends made a reservation for dinner at The Red Cat, so I went with no knowledge of the restaurant. What a find! Everything we ordered was fresh, well made and tasty. I had the burrata and squash appetizer and the salmon main course, both of which were delightful. I picked up the tab for the four of us and was astonished when the total (before tip) came to $300 - and that included a bottle of red wine. I don't think there's ever happened to me in New York before."
"Best ramen in town, maybe ever. The ambiance is chill and just gives off a positive vibe. Highly recommend if you are a noodle lover and interested in trying unique and flavorful ramen noodles! Also, the pork buns are delicious."
been eating here since i was kid - although the quality of the soup dumplings has fallen over the years (they used to make them fresh in restaurant but now they are premade and frozen I believe) they are still top notch. I always get the shanghai thick noodle with the soup dumplings and would recommend this restaurant to anyone. A lot of tourists come here so expect to wait to be seated.
could be better
"Read about this place a couple of times and finally made it on Saturday (19th). Called ahead for reservations about 6PM but was told that they didn't have anything until 915, which is always a good sign. Found out because the place is pretty small, but intimate. Was able to reserve two seats at the bar. Well were we in for a treat! Great menu, great variety and decent wine list as well. To preface, I have celiac's, lactose, fructose and sucrose intolerance and they catered to my every need. The place totes itself as certified gluten free and they back it up. Potato vodka option behind the bar, complimentary gluten free bread to dip in olive oil and diced fresh garlic. my girlfriend, who doesn't have any food allergies was given fresh french bread as well. Drinks were quick and delicious. Female bartender was fantastic all night. Before we ordered she asked if we had any allergies. Once i told her she made a note and immediately made the chef aware as we saw him peek out from the small kitchen. I had the gluten free penne with pesto (also dairy-free). My date had fresh ahi tuna with a sliced avocado salad. Both were delicious. For the entree I had the steak with sauteed broccoli rabe and mushrooms. Swapped out the butternut squash (sucrose) for potatoes, when it came out, she realized the potatoes she gave me had butter in them. Quickly, grabbed the dish, brought it in the back and within 3 minutes I had a fresh new plate ( I knew it was freshly made again because I had sliced the steak and the new dish had two new fresh pieces (of good size). My GF had black linguini with fresh shrimp in a tomato based sauced. They were both excellent. For dessert, just had a espresso that hit the spot and wasn't over steamed. Clincher was on the way out where the chef happened to be at the door and and said ""Goodnight Gino, have a good one"". My GF and I were thrown aback, looked at one another and smiled. Great experience. Would def go back."
"LINGUINI & CLAM SAUCE. Â BAM! Â The most amazing ever. Â I totally ruined a shirt digging in to this amazingly tasty dish. Also, worth noting, I kinda felt like I was in a scene out of Good Fellas (cash only), but hey, it's all good! Â I walked out alive (and full). Do it like a Don."
I've been to eat here a few times and the food is good but the service is terrible! Last time I came in here with a friend we overheard two other tables complaining about our server. Â i actually heard another customer mumble in response to do you want to see a dessert menu...i'd like to punch you in the face..
"A few weeks ago, I joined some friends for a brunch at this restaurant I had heard and read so much about. I was very excited to finally tried it..........Starting with an excellent coffee ( the coffee is a really really good coffee!!!!) and well seated in a very vibrant space .....I looked over the menu but It was so hard to make a choice. everything looked so appetizing Â Finally our matronly , ' I'm tough and I' m not taking any shit kind of attitude "" took the order. I guess it is part of the charm when restaurants make you feel they do Â a favor to serve you. .....But the favor stopped there and it's me and my friends who did them a favor to accept the food they served us. The pancakes were burned to the ground and I mean burn !!!! The poached egg Huntington was half hard boiled seating on a mealy and floury biscuit covered with a non descript Hollandaise sauce, the short ribs hash was simply boiled meat. Never had the chance to taste their drinks. We ordered them, asked again , but they never came.....;)"
"This place is wonderful, Quite,cozy and cute. The food is yummy. I had the minicachapas Â and the taquenios for appetizers and the pabellon criollo for my entree with a side of french fries. The prices were really cheap and the service was friendly."
"Just so we'll be absolutely clear about it: A couple will pay at least 350$ in the evening. We never had a dinner that expensive. Saying that, it was one of the best meal of our lives. Everything you'll taste will be accurate delicate and new, and simply will blow you away."
Yes! I ate here a while back and it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.
"My husband and I went to this restaurant for a nice night out. We were blown away by how good their food taste, the excellent service and the cleanness of the restaurant. The chef even comes out to greed the customers. It is a small restaurant so it makes it feel intimate. I totally recommend it. My husband and I keep on going back with friends. Thanks for the great food and service."
"Peprika is a top restaurant in the East Village and New York city. I've been eating at Paprika for many years. Last Sunday, I had a fabulous gnocchi. The owner chef is a hands on guy. He takes very good care of his customers. It's a neighborhood place where I always feel comfortable and very satisfied. Do not miss this restaurant."
"Danny Meyer may know how to run a four star restaurant but I question his [or his staff's] ability to select comfortable bar stools. That was just the beginning to a somewhat shaky first meal experience at his new Gramercy Park 'Roman Italian' eatery attached to the over-indulgent Gramercy Park Hotel. The chairs are, in a word, uncomfortable and while there are quite a few of them, I'm sure I'm not the only person who has found them slippery, confining and downright uncomfortable. But I digress. I came in looking for some terrific pasta and what I should have done is head over to 9th avenue and found a red sauce spaghetti house that's good, cheap and knows what comfortable seating is all about. But I didn't. And here's why: If Danny Meyer owns/runs something, it's suppose to be good - very good. So I allowed the reputation to get ahead of the meal and ended up at one of the bar area communal tables for dinner. Mistake. My food was okay; not terrific. The sauce was a bit too creamy and a bit too peppery. Believe me, I ate it all. But the downer was the lack of attention from the waitstaff [something mentioned in other reviews] at the bar. No salt. No pepper. No follow-up to see if it was good. Just a plate of pasta, an inquiry about my interest in dessert and the check. After an hour, I was ready to leave. Will I come back? Perhaps - but not to sit in the bar area... the people in the dining room looked like they were having much more fun."
"Used to be amazing, but now that it's super uber popular, there's been a dip in quality. Granted, red sauce and white sauce are still money, but the rice has gotten bland and the lamb is a little dry. However, at 3am with all your drunk friends, it's still good and a fun experience."
The 5 star reviews are true. Â Top sushi here folks. Â I can live on their tuna avocado rolls. Â ymmy!
Love Love Love the Jerk Chicken and holy cow the garlic shrimp is great! Mac and cheese is tasty as is the cabbage and rice and peas.. I am all about the islands!
"Super duper! Obviously, try the corn!"
Decent lobster roll. Great soda. Too expensive though.
"Healthy, fresh and delicious. No wonder this place draws a crowd."
"This place is far from where I live, but totally worth the trip. Cheese under sauce? Deliciously different."
"First off, the lady at the front wasn't pleasant at all. Â I had thought that my reservation was at 730pm but when I got there at 729pm...the lady out in the front..instead of greeting us was like...'I was one minute away from giving your table away!'!! I was like why? im on time...shes like you're reservation is for 715pm...ok so I apologized that I thought my reservation for 730...and anyway...why must she be so damn rude? and besides...they had FIVE other tables OPENED...with NOONE sitting on it!! ugh. anyway, back to the food. HEART ATTACK!!! Â everyone raves about the sizzling sisig--but let me tell you...it was ALL FAT. Was grossed out while eating it... couldnt even finish the dish. The khao soi was eh...Lastly, we have the grilled pork jowl which was really really tasty...! Overall, a very meh experience."
"I love this place, I live in astoria and it is the only place i go to in my hood. The fried pickles are so good, great selection of beers and the staff is soooooo nice. Sophisticated crowd."
"Good for brunch (shakshuka), good for dinner (the tapas-style sides). Fresh flatbreads, fresh spicy sauces, fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh everything. Service was brisk yet friendly and everything was well-priced. Recommended for two, for four, or for larger groups with advance notice. Only issue was the closely packed seats: with kids this can be uncomfortable getting in and out, and the noise level is fairly high even if its half-filled."
"Visited again in the last evening at ""Pommes Frites"", Its was kind of spot check to evaluate my findings. I realized that this time potatoes sticks were really good according to the standard and sauces make is more delicious for me and it tasted hot till the end and i say at Pommes Frites you will he having combination of two: (Fries + Sauces) = Tasty and hot fries I agree previously i didn't get sauces and may be my first experience was bad due to it."
"This guys know how to make a good pizza! In my first visit in New York, my friend took me to check out this place , and let me tell you I never tasted such a good pizza , their artichoke is unique and taste , the slices are huge , the only down side is the price , but still worth it."
"Sort of hard to find, pretty expensive, but wow these people know how to make incredible sushi. It is not really a surprise that almost everyone is giving this place 5 stars, this restaurant deserves it. In my opinion, it is one of the best places to get sushi in the city. If you aren't a big sushi fan, you probably will not like it that much though. But still, I would definitely recommend this place."
Good food and good services
I agree with Jamie M. My friends and I decided to come here because We didn't want to wait for 2 hours at Ippudo. I guess we should've waited at Ippudo. Momofuku's Ramen is so disappointing. Poor service.
"Dirty hipster crowd just the way I like it. Get a lone star and a shot of tequila for $5. Don't go here for wine, ever, because it's $7 and comes out of a box. BOARD GAMES. Free questionable snacks. Don't play pool."
"This place is awesome! Cheap drinks, games at the bar and they serve cheese balls! Also: BUCK HUNTER! Awesome."
"My dad loves taking me and sisters out to fancy dinners, so i am really luck that i can go to places like Balthazar! This place is fantastic. the place is usually packed but if you make a reservation you are really ok! sometimes i have waited here even with my reservation but its totally fine! the decor and ambiance are so warm and professional! the service and food was just sooooo good! i really dont understand why people dont make more restaurants like this place! a+ mr balthazar"
This place is really good at what they do- meatballs and ice cream sandwiches. They have a lot of different sauces that you can put on the meatballs and they're all really good. My favorite is the spicy meat sauce! The prices are incredible and the portions are fair. All the servers are really nice and really love the restaurant they work at.
one of my favorite thai spots in the upper east side. service is quick and friendly. the space is clean. I strongly recommend it. I had deliveries a few times. I went there with my parents and they were thrilled.
"Yeah, this place is good. I go here for brunch often because I live in the neighborhood. And because they don't only serve brunch on the weekends. Yep, you heard me...brunch 7 days a week. Â  The biscuits are really good. But I am sad they switched out the big biscuit for two small ones. Biscuits are only served on the weekends. Cash only, which is fine, there is an ATM nearby. They can get busy but it's not usually a long wait. I'm always happy to sit at the bar. Go here and expect good food and great service."
Very Delicious Grade:A
"I always want to like this place because it's so convenient if you intend to go out after dinner, but quite frankly it's just not that good and the service is really not that nice."
"Went there and was pleasantly surprised after reading some other reviews. Very nice, informal atmosphere, smaller than I expected. Excellent service sitting at the counter. Very friendly counter people. The milk shake ordered for my son was huge and delicious for $5.50, and an extra two glasses were brought over so we could share. Our party ate a variety of food. Some just so-so or bland like the hamburgers and fries, but the BLT wrap, coffee, milk shake and everything else was very good. Prices were not high considering the upscale neighborhood, but Tom's doesn't take credit cards so be sure to bring some extra cash with you."
"We dined here with friends Saturday evening because we could not get into another restaurant...much to our enjoyment. We loved the ambience and decor, the food and wine, and the service was impeccable! We were even able to meet the owner and got a brief history of the restaurant and photos on the wall. We will definitely be dining here again."
"Great place for family style! Party of 5, 2 app and 2 entree were just enough for us. Service was just ok. Family style, we started out with baked clams, fried calamari, caesar salad, a bottle of house chianti, chicken parmagiana, sausage and meatballs, rigatoni alla vodka with mushrooms, and sautÃ©ed broccoli rabe. The food as always not fancy but consistently good. Dining room is almost always noisy, not ideal for a romantic date. I keep coming back for the food. Also very quick service! I like the Ravioli di Napoli"
Excellent.
"You can find some really good soba at Soba-ya, just one street down from Rai Rai Ken. Have the cold soba, order some extra veggies and a bottle of Sake and you're good to go. Sundaes & Cones not far away for after dinner dessert!"
"I have been to both Taverna Kyclades, East village And Astoria and both had real, authentic Greek Food. The veggie chips were amazing and the shrimp Santorini was very tasty. They served us glaktoburiko for dessert which was delicious. My only complaint was that they don't serve coffee, Greek or American - they told us they are a fish restaurant & they don't serve coffee - Live and learn!"
"Went back to Black Ant again, Absolutely amazing! Same flavors, same strong great cocktails, same warm and friendly service. And the staff is always awesome!"
Noisy beyond description. Go with a crowd and eat by yourself since you can't hear anyone. But man the pizza's are good.
Went for lunch here today pulled pork sandwiches are things that I dream about and only 2 for $5 and an order of chilli cheese fries with Â its just what a persons soul needs in life the bar food in here is great and the boozeselection is also great
Best People watching place in the city. Food is always great and the service is very attentive
"Pretty amazing food. Everything was excellent. Especially the scallops, eggplant, mussels, etc. Subtle flavors combining together for complex taste."
"Reservations are a must at this trendy local, which if you know to ask, is friendly to vegetarians -- just ask for the special menu. Booth and communal seating is available along with service with a smile. The location is a little in the middle of nowhere, but its worth the effort."
Stopped on my way out of the city at 10:45. Had the California burger. Definitely a very good burger!
"I work in the area and my colleagues and I never come here for lunch if we need to be in and out in an hour. They cannot even get simple salads out timely. When we are not in a rush we do come for lunch. Nice owner, good service, tasty food and fair prices."
"Nice place, I eat there few times a month. A bit of a long wait to get the pizza, but its worth it, usually."
Besides the oysters and the excellent local beers we we served a perfectly balanced main dish of fish and vegetables (monkfish and brussels sprouts). Friendly and knowledgeable service (oyster recommendations). On a Friday night we could be seated within 20 minutes. Affordable prices.
went there for breakfast / brunch ... had some great food. Â really liked the design too.
Just amazing.
"Typical Thai restaurant, cheap and quick. Â It's scarey walking into the bar area because you never know if it's empty or packed until you get to the dining room. Â Even though you are rushed through dinner like cattle going to slaughter, the prices of the food is great. Â The drinks add up, but the food is good, fast and cheap. Â If it wasn't for the blaring techno music, it'd get more stars."
"I'm not a big fan of Italian food but I really enjoyed my food here. The risotto balls were very cheesy...it tasted like cheetos to me. Â Definitely get this! Creamy Lobster Maccheroni and Cheese was SUPERB! The sauce was perfect, the lobster was cooked to perfection, everything about this dish was great."
"I am fairly sure this is the same as Cafe Zaiya. It perplexes me how fast a storefront changes hand. Well... welcome to New York I guess? The food is solid. According to my Jap friends, the buns are fairly authentic, with red bean flavors, pinaple crispy tops etc I also enjoyed the black sesame frappe! Sorry starbucks, you are just not NEAR creative as this one"
"I've been going to Iris for almost two years now, and I've always been consistently pleased by everything they offer. The coffee and espresso is amazing. For brunch, highlights include the breakfast Caesar with whitefish toast, avocado toast and the breakfast baguette. They sometimes have huevos rancheros on special, which are wonderful - hope they bring them back soon! Their salads and sandwiches for lunch are also great, especially the smoked turkey on cranberry-pecan toast and the tuna on their great French baguette. It seems like almost everyone on Yelp agrees about how great Iris is for breakfast and lunch, so I didn't really think it was necessary to write yet another positive review. But Iris just started serving dinner! And it was so great that I wanted to spread the word. It has a totally different vibe at night, with candles on every table and an intimate, casual feel. They have a pretty good selection of wines by the glass, and interesting beer and cider on tap. My husband ordered the lamb, which was prepared with a 17-spice rub and came with a side of millet salad. It was really flavorful and perfectly cooked. I ordered homemade spelt pappardelle with roast chicken, spinach and garlic ricotta. The pasta was hearty and delicious, even though I was initially wary of spelt anything. For dessert, we got a blueberry and nectarine galette with homemade whipped cream. The pastry dough in the galette was perfect, flaky and not too sweet. We also got a honey lemon posset that was served with buckwheat poppy seed shortbread cookies. The posset was rich and creamy but had very delicate flavors. The buckwheat cookies were unbelievably good. I hope they start selling them to go in the takeaway store! I'm so glad that Iris is doing dinner now. The only other option in the immediate neighborhood is River Deli, which has great ambiance but I've never been wowed by the food there. Iris has always served consistently delicious, fresh food and they are doing an amazing job with their new dinner service so far."
"Really like the appz, very cheap place.............my walletz in luv!"
"This place is great. A gem. If you don't like it, it is you. Â You just don't get it. Maybe in the next life..."
"Simple Chinese food prepared well, served quickly and at a modest price. This is one of the best values in NYC."
"Stepping into Alta brings high hopes as it is quite an attractive restaurant. Â There exists a good buzz about the place and the clientele is young and good looking. Â Certainly a decent spot for a casual drink, but the food does not match the decor. Â The first sign is the menu which contains every tapas dish ever conceived. Â Like a greatest hits album, it has no focus and thus, nothing seems special. Â They pump out the food quickly and, although some dishes are flavorful, most are simply lackluster and all are unsophisticated. Â So, go for the ambiance, have a drink and a snack and then head out for dinner"
"I worked near here awhile and kept seeing crazy lines, figured i should give it a try. It's not half bad but it's no L&B. Don't go at exactly dinner time try when its a little slower but sometimes even lunch seems pretty busy. prices food and service are all pretty good but not nearly good enough for some of the lines ive seen."
"I initially came here with friends and loved it so much I booked another reservation 2 weeks later. Â The pork ragu is AMAZING and makes the entire dinner worth it. Â Hands down the best pork ragu I've ever had. Â I've heard great things about the maialino (the suckling pig), but it serves about 4 people, so I'm waiting for a big enough group to try it. Â  The chicken is also out of this world. Â I've always been a bit bored of chicken entrees because they always taste similar, but the chicken here is bathed in a spicy, vinegary sauce that is unlike anything I've had at an Italian restaurant. Â It's also cooked perfectly so that the skin is light and crispy and the meat is tender. Â Both times I went, everyone made sure to soak up the sauce with whatever bread we had leftover. Corn and ricotta ravioli was also delicious and fairly unique. Waitstaff is excellent and very friendly. But, the crowning achievement here is the pork!"
"Concept: Flawless; wish every restaurant were like this. Execution: Almost there. I visited Frankie's 457 one recent afternoon for an Ikea pregame after learning the Ballfields weren't open (WTF Monday?). Two friends and I split the chef's antipasto platter to go along with our salads. Big points for the marinated olives, green beans, and good quality prosciutto. I'll pass next time on the mushrooms and spicy salami, neither mindblowing. There menu's long on small plates-- salads, crostini, antipasti. I'd love to come back and sample lots of stuff besides the superb fennel/celery root/lemon/pecorino salad. A nearby table's big dish of meatballs inspired jealousy. You also don't see braciola too often on NY menus. I say the concept's great because Frankie's allows you to put together pretty much any meal you want. The low-key space imposes absolutely no expectations, and the wide selection of charcuterie yields many meal-sized configurations. But if one wants aps, a hot entree, dessert and coffee, the one can confidently ho that path, too. I say the execution needs a little work really only because of the two underwhelming antipasti and an avocado-beet salad that even this avocado and beet lover found a little too beety. Also: our waiter found an exceedingly awkward way of carding me. He sorta did this lean-back and stammered, ""Are you... of age?"" Which, I mean, if you're going to card me, fucking card me. Don't make some half-assed pretension to caring about the legality of serving a beard-incapable dude a glass of prosecco on a Monday afternoon in Carrol Gardens."
"Everyone is always talking about going to Scarpetta's for italian food, and so I bit the bullet and went with a couple of friends last weekend. Â I'm not a food snob or anything, but I do like to eat, and I really didn't find anything exceptional about the food here. Â There's a bit of a scene to be had at the bar, and its also located in the Meat Packing, but relative to the difficulty it is to get a reservation here, i'm not really sure its worth it. Â I felt that there are better options for this kind of food in the city, and i also felt if you're looking for a cool restaurant bar to hang out in, there are also better options."
"We discover Penelope. And glad we did, this is a busy little gem of a place, would not look out of place in Brighton, England with its duck egg blue planked walls and wooden floor. Service is quick and efficient and the breakfast delicious. Only gripe is that the menu seems to change at the weekend so if there's something you really like on a Friday ( Pancakes ) may not be available on a Sunday. Otherwise I highly recommend. Enjoy."
What a great find. Cool place really good wait staff and the food. There was not one drop left in my Boulibasse - and the bread could not get enough. Highly recommend going here
Pasta with the beef meatballs is THE WAY TO GO!
"Grimaldi's, Totonno's, Spumoni L&B, and Di Fara's - these are as good as pizza gets!"
"My favorite Mexican place in LES area. Their guac and tacos are generally good - though I found the cactus and fish the best. Also their soup is really good, it's super creamy and flavorful. The crunchy tortilla strips and buttery avocado slices in the soup add mixed textures to the soup, which I enjoyed a lot. Food is served fast and service is ok, but the place's a little too loud and cramped."
"A very nice, friendly and exclusive restaurant, definitely worth the trip down to the south of Manhattan. The food was very good and had nice presentation. The service staff really worked hard to give you a top service experience and they succeeded. The sommelier was very good and had a humble approach in a positive way. The wine list was really nice. I rate it 7 out of 10. (7/10) If you wanna experience a perfect love couple dinner this is the place."
"They always put brazilian soap operas on TV and it's VERY provocative. That might not be suitable for your kids, but food is freshly made and delish. You might have to cover their eyes but it'll be great to have experiment of Brazilian cuisine."
"This is the kind of place that I'm hesitant to review because I don't want one of my little secrets to get out and the place to be too busy to get in. This is by far, the best, most consistent fresh pasta I've had outside of Italy. Â It should share the class of restaurants like Al Dii La without a doubt. Â Highly highly recommend the pasta and risottos. Â Have loved them too much to ever try a meat dish."
Excellent! Went w Erica
"Got - steak and eggs Â  Â  Â  - French dips Â  Â  Â  - side of Hashbrowns Steak and eggs was perfect , rare. Pomegranate lemonade really good. French dips was ... Good but not great. Meat overcooked and meat sauce not enough dark and consistent. Hash browns : we did not eat it as we sent it back because of a big black hair mixed with it, super visible on the plate... Sad when it happens ..."
"A snowy day in New York does not stop me and apparently a mass of other people too. It was blowing snow left and right and people were waiting to get a seat at Clinton St. Baking Company. You know why? PANCAKE MONTH. That's right. A whole month where every weekday has a different variation of their fluffy pancakes. My friend and I waited for a good 30-40 minutes (and ogling at everyone else's food) before getting seated but who cares? PANCAKE MONTH. The special pancakes were the raspberry pancakes with fresh raspberries, toasted almond butter, raspberry jam, and vanilla bean whipped cream. Heavenly. Those pancakes transport your mouth into a magical place of awesomeness. You forget they're just pancakes but here they just do it so damn well! The crunchy toasted almond butter with the tartness of the raspberries and light sweetness of the whipped cream all complimented the pancakes. Everything works in harmony in the dish and as it should. It was our first time and certainly not our last. No longer a Clinton St. Baking Company pancake virgin."
"I have so much more to try here but so far ...its great food!!! My favorite empanadas so far: Veggie Reggaeton Chicken Cuban The only negative about this place is that the tables are so close, you sometimes over hear conversations you don't want to hear. Â Twice I had to sit next to freshman college kids talking about roommates who don't wash dishes and their frequent use of adderall...Oy!"
"This is a tiny restaurant with a big heart. Great food and ambiance with a twist. Spicy ketchup, outdoor seating and enclosed patio. Serves vegetarian and Moroccan specialties but also has wonderful breakfast served all day. Plus at a fair price. Good wait staff. I will go back."
"Generally, I tend to try new restaurants as much as possible. Pylos is an exception. They are so good that I just keep going back! I always come here for dinner. The lighting and decor at night make this place pretty magical. Their hot appetizers are just amazing, especially the melted cheeses and the meatballs. Drool. All the entrees are delicious. Do not leave without trying their greek yogurt with honey and walnuts. It is to die for!"
"Stepping off the street into Ootoya is like stepping into a typical modern Japanese restaurant in Japan. The decor and ambiance is Japanese, many of the diners and most of the staff are Japanese. The food is good quality and nicely prepared and presented. This is not a typical sushi place so don't expect an abundance of Maki rolls."
"Thank you for RUINING MY GREAT EVENING! I've NEVER experienced such a WONDERFUL SERVICE before, great job! I was totally disappointed today. I am not talking about my first experience at Totto, even though I had to finish my dinner in 1hour at that time, I really impressed by the food and service. That's the reason why I brought my friends to Totto today, and I made a reservation about one week ago. Since we haven't seen each other for a long time, we really wanna have good time together, so I recommended Totto to them. Granted, I know that Totto is a really popular restaurant, and I admit that they serve really good foods. However, I didn't go there to spend my money for their HORRIBLE services. Since my friends and I haven't met for a long time, we spent about 2 hours with talking and eating at Totto. (Please remember that we arrived there on time, and we were not just talking during the dinner, we kept ordering foods and the total we paid was almost $140). I admit that we might spent a long time at there, but WE DID MAKE A RESERVATION, and WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF ANYTHING such as there's time limit. So, when I noticed that the male server kept standing at the back of our table & checking on our dishes with a glance, I just thought he was just doing his job. Then, the manager also came to him, they both kept staring at us and saying something to each other, with disgruntled faces. Finally, I captured that the male server frowned, moaned, and mumbled when he saw our table still have some foods on it. So I asked him, in a very polite manner, ""Maybe we are here for too long time. Is it fine for us to stay more?,"" and his answer was ""there's no problem at all"". After a while, I still could see some female staffs at the front desk continuously glimpsed us as well. If there was a problem with it, the staff members could have informed us about the time-limit, in a very polite way. I would follow their rule, without any complaints. But they rather chose some way to make their customers feel uncomfortable by expressing their discontent behind our back. THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY RUDE! What made me frustrated the most was that my Japanese friend told me like this: ""I am really sorry to you, as a representative of all Japanese people. Not every Japanese restaurants' service is so poor like this"". Thanks again, RUINING my reunion with my great friends! This is the most impressive experience that I've ever had in my life. Not any and every restaurant can offer such a wonder memory like you did! THANK YOU SO MUCH! Tl;dr - THEIR SERVICE SUCKS."
"EXCELLENT PLACE! I've been here 3 times and have been treated like a king at all times. The first time I came I was definitely relieved that I had followed my instinct and made reservations for Saturday night because it gets EXTREMELY packed during the weekends. If you're a walk in be prepared to wait for a very long time. During my first visit my server was Javier. One of the best, most informative, and attentive servers I've had. Any question I had he had an answer for with the upmost detail possible. Besides the food he is one of the reasons I decided to come back. For that night I kept it simple I had lobster mac & cheese (amazing) and a pollo a la plancha (delicious). I loved everything I ordered that day. I also had the pleasure of meeting Hermino (hope I spelled it right), whom stopped by my table to ensure that we were having a good time. I must say from what I've seen he must be the best dressed gentleman working in the restaurant, and definitely made me feel like I was at home. Definitely a team player since I'm assuming based on his attire he shouldn't be picking up our plates, but did so anyways. I decided to go once again the following week. Initially I was pretty disappointed that Javier was not there that night, but the hostess Melanie (very nice & professional) assured me that my server Michelle would ensure that I have a great experience. Boy was she right! Michelle was AMAZING! GRACEFUL! SUPER SWEET! She catered to every single request I made. Initially I was going to order the lobster mac & cheese, but once I told her I had already tried that she recommended for me to switch it up and try the Crispy Arepas. I don't like beef too much, so she offered to have them with chicken or vegetarian style. She intrigued me so much when she called them little bites of heaven, that I chose chicken. OMG she was right it is everyone a Spanish person loves in one bite! She ensured our sangria glasses were never empty, made another awesome recommendation with the Lime Crusted Salmon (to die for). Also once again Hermino saw us, stopped by our table and had a wonderful conversation with him. Absolutely amazing both the food and the staff. Now I didn't know the restaurant served Brunch until Michelle told me that Saturday night so I decided to go brunch that next Sunday. I was surprised, but yet ecstatic to see Michelle there once again since she was serving me the night before at midnight. Regardless of the time she still looked like one of the most presentable servers during both dinner & brunch. (A few servers were looking like they had just rolled out of bed during every single occasion I've gone). Once again she never failed to appease to me & was extremely attentive. Brunch was DELISH! The huevos rancheros was the best dish to fuel up my tank for the beginning of the day. So as you may have read I DEFINITELY recommend blend on the water for both brunch and dinner. From now on I will always request to have Michelle or Javier as my server.. Love them both! Always make reservations with time, and be prepared to eat some amazing food!"
"Excellent Greek on the UWS. I have been coming here for a while I first went when they were located on 79th street. The food was excellent then, it was just ok for a little while when they first opened at the new location and now wow, better then ever. I went last night we had the octopus appetizer and shared the lamb and branzino. Everything was great, the food and service."
"A little salty for my taste, but SO DAMN GOOD. Â I actually prefer the margherita; the artichoke pizza is delicious but I'm usually sick of it half way through the slice. It's a bit intense, but perfect to share! I have dropped in for a slice post-bar, post-work, post-light dinner and it always hits the spot."
Sugar cured bacon. Bellini. Blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter. Pure heaven. We arrived a few minutes before they opened for dinner so we didn't have to wait. I had read great reviews about this place and begged my friends to make the trek with me. We were not disappointed.
"In Park Slope, it doesn't get much better then this(although there is better pizza in Brooklyn). Â This place has some excellent pizza and good service. Â This is truly brooklyn pizza."
"Stopped by for some quick tacos on a cold day, about 3:30. Â Snagged a table immediately and devoured one carnita and one carne asada taco. Â Both were tasty, and fresh and hit the spot and the hot sauce was fine for me, although I love spicy food generally. Â I thought both contained flavourful, juicy meat, but agree with others that $3.75 for a single taco may be a bit steep, but not out line with other competitors and I would rather support Dos Toros than a chain taqueria/Mexican joint. Â Overall, a good choice for a bit if you are near Union Square and you can grab a seat."
YUM! The chicken Roulade and truffle mash potatoes is delicious! I had this same meal a couple years ago and just remembered it was in the neighborhood so I had it delivered to me and it was as good as I remember. Next time I will try the Oxtail Papardalle.
"I used to live in Detroit. Â  downtown.. Â near Greektown... Â  so I had Greek food for weeks on end... Â  but none as tasty as the grape arugula salad and the grilled octopus I had here! Â  Â My friends had amazing drinks, too!"
"Yay! Â I'm a fan. Â  Well, the food was awesome. Â So many funky options--and they all tasted terrific. Â There's also non-funky items for the less adventurous. Â  4 stars again for the non-food related aspects. Â Our server was slightly less than a jerk. Â I mean, by the end I was giving exaggerated 'thank yous' every time he brought a new dish, just to see if I could get a 'you're welcome'...or even a nod. Â I was not successful."
I can't get enough of this place but I also can't get a table. It's a great fun menu but the place is too small and too crowded and there's just too many other great spots to eat in the area. The few times we did actually wait it out for a table everything was delicious and the staff was a pleasure. I'd be giving 5 stars if I could eat here weekly like I want to. I'll never try the one on Bedford either since it's across the street from one of the best pizza places in the world.
"I like this place it's yummy :) Aside from wide selection and good service this place is cozy with good food. Came with two other people who have already been here before and they knew I would love it. Got spicy tofu with rice and some misu soup. I've wanted to go back for a while now but haven't found the time yet. I am constantly craving Korean food and with here's low prices I can pig out. Will def. Be back soon OVERALL: fill your cravings with this cheap yummy place.....although some things are packaged to go, you have the choice of sitting in the back of the store, where they offer tables and seats although at night its a bit crowded"
"I had two breakfast empanadas for $4.50 total. They were very tasty - especially the sauce provided. Service was good - No complaints. If you're hungry and in the area, I highly recommend."
excellent.
"The char sui pork was so excellent with perfect balance of charred and tender meat, while the duck was so decent and you do not need to worry whether it's too fatty or nothing special."
"Okay, so it's got history and there's apparently an oven in the back that says this place dates back to 1901. That's all well and good, and perhaps this is the sole reason to even go to to Soho (unless you're a touristy soccer mom or prepubescent girl) but aside from that, there's nothing elevating this place to legendary landmark status. It's the Applebee's of pizza restaurants, and the interior feels exactly like that. Instead of kitschy Americana junk littering the walls though, you get more of the typical red-sauce Olive Garden decor. It's really just a giant T.G.I. Friday's at the core though with typical 20-something kids running the joint. You're really just a number, not a valued customer here. Somehow, the quaint history of this place got lost in the process of making it accessible to tourists and thus exceedingly profitable for the folks who own this place. My experience though with this giant of the New York pizza world was actually not too bad. We were seated fairly quickly in the lower part of the restaurant, the table next to us was occupied by a handful of old-school Brooklyn-esque Italians chitchatting, shooting the breeze. If only they had those guys permanently on display there then this place would score a few more points on atmosphere. The pizza however, (the standard Gennaro pie which is your basic mozzarella, sauce, and basil pie) leaves much to be desired. Sure, it's a pretty respectable pizza compared to the garbage those fools out in Chicago consider pizza, but this is New York. Obviously you can do better. Yes, it's a good thin crust but that's really about the only thing going for it. (Head to any half-decent Brooklyn pizzeria for the same product but better) There's no handcrafted love to these pies and it shows, you're getting a quickly made pizza that while good, is far from anything great. I suggest that you visit Lombardi's once, as it is perhaps the last decent remnant of good Manhattan pizza with a bit of history to it. The only reason I entertained the idea of coming here was because Lucali's Pizza in Brooklyn was closed. Aside from that, there's no reason to ever return to Lombardi's unless you somehow really find their pizza to be something really delicious, which I don't."
"One of the best Greek joints I've been to in NY. Think Avra, but without the pretense, price and lines. The fried cheese is addictive!"
Ron Swanson's dream come true.
Only one of a few Chinese Restaurant open pass midnight. Thin skin dumpling are the way to go.
Great: Food Service Decor Vibe Crowd What else do you need? Take a nice stroll in the area after dinner.
"We all loved it! The service was excellent, and the food was delicious. My braised octopus appetizer was one of the best things I ever ate! The pasta was perfect. My only complaints were the over-priced cocktails and the volume of the noise - the background music made conversation difficult."
"You will have to queue because this place is so popular. Some of the best dumplings I have had in the world and we travel a lot, and so cheap. Love it."
California burger is one of the best burgers in town
"This is a gorgeous ultra modern restaurant just opposite the Hudson River located in one of the very fancy river view residences in the West Village. The menu is fabulousand the service superior. The tomato gezpacho and calamari are two excellent appetizers and my mother exclaimed that the fried chicken was the best ever. I loved my hake main, prepared and presented to perfection. Desserts are outrageous."
"Old fashioned pizza is the BEST downtown by a landslide! Reasonably price, plenty for leftovers, and great tasting! If you're headed to Stone Street, definitely consider Adrienne's! (Also delivers to the FiDi and Battery Park City)"
"We waited an hour and a half for our main course and practically had to inhale our food, because we had to finish by 9pm for a group of people that never arrived. Also the food was very salty and greasy, not to mention expensive and had very small portions. Disappointed."
"It is Fantastic! A paradise for chicken lover. But ... seafood is awesome, too. So, great experience. Spicy but delish. Starting from any appetizer especially empanadas and ceviche mixto and finishing with any fish meal like corvina inca. Of course chicken is the main dish and the best ever here with secret marinade recipe and perfect cooking. Chicken Pio is a CHICKEN PIO! Yes it is very good. Their Matador Combo is enough for 4 hungry people, 3 at least. And sangria... grab a pitcher or two;) It is a very busy spot and overcrowded on weekends so make a reservation ahead."
"Sakagura is known for its extensive sake collection and limited edition fresh soba, but all the food is appealing, and I love the cavernous room, which is decorated like a Kurosawa feudal Japan movie set."
"I really enjoyed brunch at Jane. The ambiance is great and the food was very good. A bit over priced for what you get, but it's still a good time. Service was very good."
"Food was delicious. Â Our waitress, Natalia was the best! Â Go on Monday or Tuesday night for amazing service and a new friend."
"Best pizza I've had in NYC and the one I got didn't even have cheese on it! We went on a Thursday night at around 9:30 pm. The place was busy but we didn't have to wait to be seated and once we were, the service was quick. I got a vegan pizza with kale (from the nearby rooftop garden!) and some kind of lemon olive oil. So good! My date loved his (non-vegan) pizza too. Everyone was really nice and while we were dining, Paulie Gee himself came by to see how everything was. We'll definitely be back."
"This was my first time, and I would definitely return to this upscale but unpretentious restaurant. We started with drinks - the Jalisco Pear was the most deliciously complex cocktail I have had in a long time - followed by a dozen raw oysters with an assortment of delightful sauces. Chose sea bass and pork for the dinner entrees and we shared them. Both were wonderfully flavorful and perfectly prepared. Dessert was a tray of artisan cheeses and port. The service was perhaps the finest I have encountered in a restaurant. They really made us feel special. It was quite expensive, but we did splurge on oysters, cocktails and dessert. The entrees themselves were reasonably priced for the quality."
"Amy Ruth's is amazing. The location, the vibe, the food all play into this delightful food experience. Subway stops right next to the restaurant. The food is reasonably priced, especially for the City. The food was excellent here. I ordered chicken and waffles smothered. Â Everything was hot, fresh and tasty. No complaints at all. Nice big portions. I also ordered a side of Mac and cheese. It was great. Complimentary cornbread was also nice. Decor was nice, place was clean, and the music was good. Â  Overall, I would recommend this place, and have. Numerous times."
"Big Tray Chicken (their signature dish), Homemade Steamed Dumplings, Pancake with Beef are always my favorites. I've been coming here since it opened and theres no surprise at all, it only got more and more business. They provide fast service though the big tray chicken will take a while. Well the bread and butter of this place is if you love beer, it is definitely welcome here for Free. It is completely BYOB and I always try to bring a 6 pack or a 24oz Tsing Tao Heineken or Budweiser with me. The only problems I see in this restaurant is that it is very small, perhaps enough for just 20 patrons and to make a long story short this is where the already seated customers take advantage. The restaurant does take reservations in case you absolutely want a seat at a designated time though its not guaranteed."
"Real Â good argentinean food!! The place is small and really cute,with an old argentinean deco. I had the empanadas, different to all that i tried. The calamaris weren't the best thing on the menu. But the ceviche de carne (meat ceviche) was nothing to compare with!!! amazing!!! made me forget about the calamaris in a second. The skirt was really good too. Prices were affordable as well. I will come back."
"Fresh, fresh deliciousness. Grab a fish taco."
The lunch was terrific especially the tempura green beans. I had the mussels which were very tasty and my companion had the shrimp tacos which she liked. The menu is varied and creative. Also food is on the healthy side. Since it was around 1p.m. when we arrived there were not that many people in the restaurant so it was easy to have a conversation. Would definitely go back to try other things on the menu.
"Had heard about this place when it opened, kinda forgot about it, finally tried it. The title of this review refers to the feeling I had of being pretty blown away. I wanted to order everything on the menu and probably could've eaten most of it. Portions are small but the flavors are huge. A real treat."
"If you want cheap, good and fast food in chinatown, you cant go wrong with Big Wong. This is a small no frills chinese restaurant serving fast food such rice, noodles and congee. We were attracted to it by the USD24 ginger and scallions lobster and that how we ended up having lunch here, and the lobster dish was very good and for USD24 !!! Tats cheap. We also had a roast duck rice and stir fried kailan vegetables, which was equally good too. Great value for your money in an expensive city like New York. In short, it was a very good meal here and cheap too."
"yum yum yum! Thank you Marlow & Sons! Yet again you have made my day wish you perfect (yes perfect) cappuccino, and deliciously flakey croissant. Too many wonderful things here. Really, too many. I kinda wish I could put my bed here and just live around all the wonderful yummy things."
"Love this restaurant. The food is so wonderful. The staff is amazing..Didn't have to ask for coffee refill, they were there before my cup was finished. I recommended this restaurant to all my friends. I can't wait to go back!"
"Finally, a spot in the Village perfect for date night and dinner with friends! The ambiance is lively, decor is rustic and sexy, staff are a pleasure. The space is an adventure to walk through; the bar area is spacious, looks like there will be live music in the back room; upstairs is a great room for parties. I went with two friends and we split Â the Tartufo pizza (a truffle delight!), their homemade pappardelle, and their juicy burger Â on a foccacia bun . I must mention the pizzas are made in a woodfired oven! We all had a glass of wine, lots of options with 25 by the glass available. Getting more friends together to go this week for cocktails and dinner."
"Bohemian has definitely become one of our favorite places. Â Great food..wonderful service..cool, cozy, intimate ambience..so comfy, you'll end up chatting and sharing dishes with next tables. Â Tried too many delicious dishes to list all..with one exception..just one; husband and I had beef with their sliders. Â Why put mayo & ketchup on really good meat? Â We would've preferred w/o. Â I still love you, Bohemian!"
As a college student you associate ramen with the 2 minute microwavable noodles you ate when out of cooking options and money. I guarantee you will have a different perspective once you eat here. Hands down without a doubt the best ramen you will ever eat. Also the ramen of the week is always delicious-- and what a great concept! Not to mention the pork buns are worth going here themselves. Must eat while in NY
"Went to this place after reading the reviews online. Have to agree that it is super cute, romantic, and well-priced. Especially for summer, this venue is great for strolling by the river; getting some ac, greek salad, and couscous; and then heading out again to meatpacking."
"Succulent broth, chewy noodles, buttery pork slices, spicy, but not too spicy..I am big fan of the spicy ramen. Â Also agree on trying one of the tasty rice bowl appetizers and yes, cheaper than Ippudo. Â No wait if you get there 5:30 or 6pm. Â Definitely ranks up there in the ramen category in NY."
WOW! Just an amazing experience. Â  It is now my favorite go to place. Â Tucked away down a little alley... Â a friend of mine who is an ultimate New Yorker who knows all the little hide away places.. Â  I will be back!
This is my go-to spot for fish lunch in this hood. It's really super fresh and delicious. My fav dish is the fish cooked with herbs and olive oil with a salad..I usually get the tuna or bass. The fried calamari is awesome.
"Everything in this restaurant is great, especially the sausage and chicken gumbo along with the blackened catfish and cheesy grits. Love the staff, \will always go back. Just be prepared if you go for the weekend brunch for noise and cramped, that's because the food is so good, everyone is there and chatting up a storm along with the music."
"Best falafel in the city - plain and simple. Everything else that I have had here has been great as well including the salads, hummus and home made pitas. I've never had much of a problem with wait time at this place and the service is so nice. I highly recommend this place. CHECK IT OUT"
My friend had told me about this place so while I was in the area I decided to check it out. Nice ambiance with a great beer selection and friendly service. Try the shrimp and grits..delicious! I'll be back for more!
i'm giving this place one star because I called to place an order to pick up and they had me on hold for 10 minutes..? Â not cool.................balls.
"Unique Pizza! As my quest to find the best pizza in NYC. I came across Paulie Gee's A very dark atmosphere. Opens at 6pm- anyway, the have unique pizza creations in here. I haven't try all the combos yet. But I am pretty close. Went there a couple of times already and enjoy it. It is like naan bread with toppings on it. Is the best way to describe it. The pizzas that I like are Grapeful Dead and hellboy which happens to be my favorite. Paulie Gee the owner of the place, walk around and ask you how is everything? He is very friendly and we chat will all the customers that dine in. This is # 2 on my list on Pizza of best in NYC. Ask for the Mexican Coke. It is made with real cane sugar and not high fructose corn syrup."
The wait wasn't that long. The ika appetizer was yummy! Â The ramen was of course excellent! Add the egg and pork belly to make it even better~
"Awesome place, great deal, fantastic service. Â But it is a Ramen place and the patrons need to get w/ the program. Â You get in, you order, you eat and you get out. Â You do not spend an hour and a half jabbering at a Ramen place. Â People come here for authentic food so be authentic yourself and at least eat at a reasonable pace. Â Other than the glacial pace of some patrons, no complaints at all. Â I highly recommend the pork belly & the spicy ramen. BTW - I went w/ a Japanese couple who were quite upset w/ how long the wait was and how slow the turnover was at some seats."
"We ordered a spinach omelette and a white cream chicken mushroom crepe.(I forgot those names exactly) It was so tasty. The white cream was rich and the omlette was soft. I really recommend it. We didn't order drinks, therefore paid only ï¼„26 for them including tip. I'd like to go there again."
"The Odeon is one of those reliable restaurants you forget about until you need a place that will please everybody, go back and remember why it's still around after all these years. Â  Food is reliably, consistent great (steak frites and a salad) and that's no easy feat. Â Great wine selection and the service is great. Â I would say it's a bit on the expensive side but a really great NYC restaurant."
"Jadis feels like a best kept secret that you've just discovered. Its warm, intimate and has an inviting old-world ambiance that makes you want to stay for awhile. The vibe is perfect for sipping on wine and sampling from the menu to your hearts delight. I come here to relax and unwind. Perfection!"
This place has great burritos although it is really small inside and there isn't a lot of place to sit and enjoy the meal. Â Highly recommend it!
"I was introduced to this outstanding establishment last night, by friends who live nearby. From the moment you enter through a gorgeous courtyard, you step inside in a charming, multi-level, warm hued room. You simply must start a cocktail. My favorite was the ""Hemingway"". Many were enjoyed The food and service were simply outstanding in every respect. The ambiance was very special, and this place would be perfect for a romantic dinner (I was with two buddies, so that wasn't the tenor of our meal), and for a fun night with friends."
This place is phenomenal great micheladas the tacos are the best in new york. Go here before they move to st marks and everything goes to poop.
"The sides are equallly good including kale mashed potatoes, ratatouille, fresh seasonal green vegetables. There is a small farmstyle table if you wish to eat in, but it looks like the majority of business is takeout. Do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did."
"This is a great place to grab a drink with friends, especially on a nice day when the windows are open and you can sorta feel like you're almost outside. There are things I love about it, and things I'm not too thrilled about. First, the things I love- the open windows; the fries (though a little greasy); the girl who brings out your food (very sweet); their system of serving food; the decor and casual atmosphere; most of the bartenders are cool and helpful. The things I don't love- it's been WAY too crowded lately, which is good for business but bad for me; the burgers are OK and the pulled pork is way too greasy (the bun literally falls apart in your hand), I think they could be improved; one bartender, not sure if he is still there, is a hipster with a stick up his rectum who literally whined at me and copped an attitude when I accidentally gave him the wrong denomination bill when I was paying- as if I was intentionally trying to get away with something. Seriously? I'm the type of person who always gives money back when the cashier accidentally gives me too much change back. The insinuation was insulting, and when I called him on it, in an effort to help the young man/boy/child improve his customer service skills, he copped an attitude and might have even said ""whatever""."
"I have been here 4 times in the last 4 months. Â I would come here more often but I live in FiDi and this place is in Hell's Kitchen. Â Woe is me Â :( If this was in my neighborhood, I believe I would eat here at least 3-4 times a week. Â Is the food THAT good? Â No, but it is better than most. Â I LOVE spicy spicy food and this place gives my spice a kick! This that I always love is the Papaya salad, the chicken curry puffs, Pad Kee Mao. Â I have tried almost every dish on that menu (yes, even though I have been there only 4 times, I order a Sh*t ton of food). Â All are fair to excellent. Â  It is the best Thai food I have had in NYC thus far. Â Any other places that I should try?"
The zucchini soup was very delicious. Pasta arrabiata and skate wing were both very good. The lemon panna cotta was to die for! Service was very attentive and sincere.
"Tiny little hole in the wall. Food is really yummy - dumplings are big, plump, and tasty. The sesame bread with duck is delish too but a bit greasy. For value this place is 5-stars but I'll take 2 away for eh service."
I had chicken platter with rice and pita bread covered with white and red sauce. Â The meat had flavor but to me it was like any other cart food and wouldn't stand in line again for it.
"This place is a cute little hole in the wall with great ambiance and a cool staff. I love their wines (try the white zinfandel - not your grandma's white zin but dry and fruity). The food is very good, the only comment I would have is that the food comes out in such a strange order that sometimes you think they forgot something... they didn't, it is on it's way, just not how you expected it. Service is really good, though when I was there they only had one bartender/server so it was a little bit of a wait for refills on wine, water, etc. The whole by-the-kilo thing is a little weird, but it is only a couple if their dishes and I did not try those. Looking forward to trying them next time!"
"What a great, cozy place! At first site it did not hit me as something special, but I decided to give it a try. We sat in the middle table with the benches and it just felt right. The personnel are amazing, the food is just the right quantity (we had brunch), good coffee, great clientele. Â Just do not expect to get amazed with the food. And I really appreciated the waiter filling up our glasses with water every 5 minutes."
"Like the other reviews have said, the food at Pies N Thighs is awesome. I just love the smell as soon as you walk in! Only minus would be that the staff seem a little too cool so the service isn't the most attentive. But, at the end of the day, I'll keep going back because its delicious."
"The falafel was flavorful and fresh, but the woman serving it was a bitch"
"What a little gem... I had been told rather a lot about this little modest restaurant but it completely exceeded all my expectations. We ordered the mussels to start which were sublime. I had a great bit of chicken then to follow and my boyfriend, who is a burger fanatic, said 'it was the best burger he had ever had'. Such lovely staff, the room is a little cramped but I think that just adds to the charm. So perfect."
"Great place they have here. Not sure I'd take 3 trains to go there again, but nice place."
"It was excellent. Food was great, price was wonderful! I very often go to Thai restaurant, the food way above average. However, it was a bit less than I expected. I heard so many good things about the food. So I expected too much. I order several things, I really enjoyed soft-shell crabs with mango sauce. I don't know that is thai food, however the sauce was very thai-like sauce. excellent. I also enjoyed traditional food such as pad thai, papaya salad, etc. I didn't like much Tom Ga Kai (coconut soup) it was a bit too sick and salty to me. The service was excellent. We sit down in the back garden. Very nice atmosphere. They were very very nice. Great place to go."
Pretty decent bar with lots of people. It's nice and close to penn station so you can just have a drink before going home. Plus they always have the latest games on so it get pretty loud and rowdy here. I come here about once a week or so.
"Quality of ingredients are fantastic. We ordered a regular pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. There was also a mozzarella salad and arugula salad. The large square pizza is an amazing deal Â crust is crispy to the touch and taste, and the cheese and sauce are a delightful combination. Besides that it was relatively a pleasant lunch."
Consistently good food!
"Cozy atmosphere,great service,prices are right,but more important ,anything you order is delicious! We always order the grilled octopus as an appetizer - amazingly tender and flavorful.Ditto for the calamari,which is never tough or rubbery.Swordfish kebabs, chicken or lamb kebabs,always cooked to perfection. Greek salads,spinach pie,are all tasty.One of us is Greek,and cooks Greek food regularly, yet when a break from cooking is needed,we head to Taverna Kyclades,our favorite,moderately priced Greek spot."
"Really wonderful. Such friendly waiters, such energetic feel. Sweet ambiance. Very very tasty food and nice variety of options, but not too many so not overwhelming. Food came with perfect timing. Nice options of wine. Waiters had tried all of the food and wine options, which is soooooo important, and then helped me pair better. Even got a second glass of wine for free! Make sure to ask for the Savored coupon if you do it though, because they forgot to include mine!"
Its so good. I have yet to eat something I do not love. Will be back many many many time.s
Very cool restaurant. When we arrived we were quickly greeted. Host greeted us like he knew us. It was pooring outside so for some reason I expected all staff to be in a bad mood. All staff was incredible! We had a tight seating area after we walked through the kitchen. I also felt a little weird waking through the kitchen but it was cool seeing the kitchen in action. Waiter was very helpful and food was incredible.
"Very tasty risotto, and its cool that is is gluten free. i recommend any of the risotto dishes with truffle oil. also, the shrimp they put in the risotto have the tails removed. nice little detail. nobody eats shrimp tails. a bit pricey for the portion size. otherwise, id throw up 4 stars. its a crowded little place, so delivery is the way to go."
"I really did not like the food here. The service and decor looked nice, but the food was not great by any means."
The meal quality is so high and the all food stuff have quality taste and the restaurant environment is very beauty full so i am so glad and happy with my all gathering.
"Delicious sliders, delicious shakes, delicious fries, solid beer selection. Â I was disappointed by the bacon sliders because the bacon is chopped up in the patties and essentially has the same effect as adding extra salt. Â Meh. Â Highly recommended!!!! Â Nice ambiance and they play good music (usually)."
GREAT FOOD! Having said that... I don't know where they placed our coats (4 of them and a scarf). Two of the coats came back wet and stained. Cleaners kind of stain. Both are very good quality coats. The scarf...missing. SHAME ON YOU!
this place has all the history; yes. actually not too impressed with the pie. atmosphere is festive; great for groups. better pizza in the hood
"This is a great little lunch spot! Â I must have walked by this place a hundred times going to and from work, but always thought it was just a bakery or something. Â So I finally tried it out for lunch and I have to say it was great! Service was timely, friendly, and very helpful. Â Food was very tasty. Â I had the croque madame and my fiance had the grilled chicken sandwich and we were very pleased. Looking forward to coming here again and trying the other things on the menu! A great place for lunch! I recommend it!"
"Oh? What? You don't like good cheap food? You don't like getting steaming hot dumplings or other Asiatic delicacies for less than a crappy order of fries from a fast food burger joint? Then you should not come here. Ever. More for me. Seriously, this is an addiction even your mother can get behind."
"Food is good, but is it really worth the wait?"
"One of the best burgers I have ever had. ever. They have a spiced warm wine that is perfect for a winter night. Downside is that they dont take reservations so you just have to wait for a table to open up, we waited about an hour, some of that time was spent at the bar but it gets super super crowded, but if the weather is bad you dont have anywhere else to wait. It would be better if you could make a reservation."
I love Minca ramen and so should you! The portions are large and the price is right. Â My favorite is the kimchi ramen. The staff are friendly and efficient. I can't wait to go back.
"If you need a quick bite to eat in the Grand Central area, I recommend Cipriani Le Specialita for its quick made-to-order sandwiches and salads. Staff is efficient, and the choices are varied. They offer a few hot items, too, as well as desserts. Don't expect a seat, though, because tables are very limited. Great for to-go, though. I give it a thumbs up."
Yummy
Amazing amazing. Cool inside. Grotto. Excellent inexpensive food.
This place is the closest thing you can possibly get to a speakeasy. Such an awesome ambiance and atmosphere. The waiters/waitresses are fully dressed and in character as if in the 1930's. They have a fantastic bar which is pretty expensive but worth it. I haven't tried the food but i heard good things. Live instrumental bands that play jazz.
Who cares about the food when you have to wait 65873906790236 years to get in? The hostess has no clue what is going on so good luck trying to score a table. Totally infuriating for just meh food. The line of hipsters around the corner just shows you what suckers people are for hype. Go to Guerro's around the corner instead. You will NOT be sorry! And you can even sit down! Woo Hoo!
taste is Good! it's like Japanese restaurant bar.
"Okay.. so the pizza ain't the best, but it's nevertheless very good. Â But if you know the history behind it, it's entertaining to go. Â  The story is, Madonna stopped by here to eat some pizza.. and the parrapizzi got all hot and under her collar... her bodyguards, or Madonna herself grabbed and pushed them away, and some cameras were yanked and smashed too. Anyways, the fight or melee is not well documented but a lawsuit followed to recover damages to the photographers. Â  Yep, I was living in Soho at the time.. so for me.. it was exciting times with lots of famous peeps wandering in the area."
The Zaru soba is amazing! Try it with tempura and it's even better!
"Had lunch here the other day. Everything was duck which is great for me because I love duck! Prices are a little ridiculous. It was $60 for two people for lunch, that being said we ordered alot of food because we wanted to try everything. The duck sandwich was absolutely amazing: It was a duck sausage with a duck liver mousse on this great crispy bread. Pork buns also delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the duck wontons and the duck over rice with a scallion pancake was good not great- I wish it was crispy!"
Wow...best value I have ever experienced. Extremely good prices for huge portions of DELICIOUS food. Every other restaurant in the area is doing the complete opposite by serving tiny portions for ridiculous amounts of money. This place is amazing! Really good drinks and delectable mediterranean menu!
"I went to this restaurant monday and I had a great experience. The food was great of course but what I really loved was the waitresses and waiter (one had colorful hair, one had big hair with big glasses to go with it, and the waiter was bold lol) they were very different individuals but soooo fun and funny and because of that I will come back every monday after work. So next time you go look for them!"
"You'll thank your good luck for finding this place. We expected to wait for a while but were seated as soon as we got our drinks. Excellent bar, even better food if that's possible. Do not miss the artichoke dip - it's a little piece of heaven. Vibrant, young (30 something), welcoming atmosphere. The decor is a bit overwhelming though (just too many dead animals to my liking)."
"This place is great, Â food is awesome. Â The waitstaff is really nice and attentive. Â Always packed. Â We made a reservation and still waited 45 minutes to get in. Â Small and simple decor, it's been there for a while for a reason. Â If you want good food, go there and they will feed you like real Italians, I would go back again."
I had a great brunch here last week. Â Great granola with yogurt good coffee and loved the egg sand. Â I will be back for dinner.
"The alley screams hipster NYC spot. Â Went here for dinner and loved it. Â They make a really good spiked hot chocolate... For dinner I had the pork, some unique flavors goin on there. Â I also tried my friend's lamb stew which was great as well."
"I do not think even Sisyphus is required to scratch himself, or to groan, or to rejoice, as the fashion is now, always at the same appointed places. And it may even be they are not too particular about the route he takes provided it gets him to his destination safely and on time. And perhaps he thinks each journey is his first. This would keep hope alive, would it not, hellish hope. Whereas to see yourself doing the same thing endlessly over and over againfills you with satisfaction. Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Nothing to be done."
"No Frills No Cell Phones Great Chilli Small, Standard Menu Bold Specials (compared to the rest of the menu) Historic Allure Varied Crowd (in a good way) A place to go often Comfortable Dirty, Casual, Dressy, Cool"
"The food is incredible! We had a mojito and a caipirinha from the bar so start off the night...both were good and strong :) Had ceviche for an appetizer and although it was tasty, I was hoping for a larger portion than what came to the table...we ordered 2 entrees and they were both amazing! The ""Lechon"" (roast pork) was very well seasoned and beautifully presented...the ""Moqueca"" (Brazilian paella) was also very good but not very generous in terms of the seafood portions. For dessert, we shared a ""Panqueque"" (crepe with dulce de leche and pistachio ice cream) and it was exquisite! Overall experience was great: food and service were top notch...just make sure you bring a lot of ""dinero"" because it is not cheap to eat here!"
"Delicious! Brunch food is to die for. I had the tomato pesto prosciutto baguette. Oh my god... The bread was so fresh. We ended with a strawberry crepe, yum. It's so cute on a corner. Very Parisien."
"Coffee is good. Â Sandwhiches are good. Â Atmosphere is very nice. Â  I really wish this place took credit card. Â I know it is the hip thing not to accept credit card, but when your sandwhiches are $9 and your coffee is $5, you aren't a cheap little coffee shop that should expect people to spend cash at your place. Â Yes, the CC companies charge you, but most orders are over $10, so get over it. Â Not that I don't have the cash, but I usually only carry around small amounts, and to spend a chunk of it on my morning coffee and sandwhich is tough to swallow. I would definitely go here more often if they took credit card. Â It is the #1 deterrent for me and this place. Would be 4 stars if they accepted CC, with the potential for 5 stars. Â The quality of the food and coffee is good."
"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet, it's my favorite breakfast restaurant in the city. I do recommend getting take out because the lines are incredible. If you do decide to eat at the place get there before 9. I have only tried a couple of dishes on the menu, not because I have only been here a couple of times, but because they were so good I wanted them again and again. Blueberry Pancakes and Salmon Eggs Benedict. Okay, let me break down the pancakes. they are served with a warm maple butter sauce, topped with wild Maine blueberry's. My mouth is watering just writing this review. New York Magazine awarded them twice for the best pancakes in the city. Moreover, they beat Bobby Flays blueberry pancakes on his show, Throwdown! For the Salmon eggs Benedict, my description just sums up to one word, outstanding. All in all, this place is a must try and one that you will not regret."
The staff service of this restaurant is outclass and the food stuff is so good i am very glad and fully enjoy ans really meal is so nice and full of taste
Love the hummus and warm pita!
Hands down lives up to the hype. Â So what the pie is $5. Â It's good. Â So is the fried chicken. Â I'd eat here everyday if my girlfriend allowed me to do so.
Great place. Exceptional customer service. I had a blast!
"mussels , skirt steakand some type of angel hair pasta that reminded me of instant Lipton noodles. Â The best things were the bread and olives. Service was good, Sommelier was great and ambiance was energetic."
"While this restaurant gave me vibes of being inauthentic and kitschy, we ordered take-out from this place, and this is the first time I've been offended by a delivery. They put the beef which is supposed to be rare, into the soup instead of a separate container, and it became overcooked and stuck together in a tough ball. The pho bo had no flavor- the soup was incredibly oily and bland. My dish, the singapore lak sa, was a watery flavorless barely edible coconut concoction. The thai iced tea was not put in a cup but a little plastic container and was only good for a few mouthfuls. If you're going to charge 30 dollars for what costs you a few dollars to make at least put a little effort into the product. We were Â not impressed to say the least and never ordering from here again."
Good place for brunch if the wait at Sarabeth's is too long. Was not disappointed. Brighter ambiance. The ferns reminded me of a scene from Titanic.
"Lupa is Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich's Osteria Romana - a casual Italian restaurant. The cuisine at Lupa is inspired by area of the Lazio which is the region of Italy centered around Rome. The menu consists of simple dishes using fresh, locally sourced and sustainable ingredients. The food is not outstanding but is certainly good. Certain items are a must try at Lupa. One of those is the house-cured meats (Salumi) as is the delicious rosemary focaccia. Others such as the Octopus with Farro & Salsa Verde was really disappointing. The waiters are adorable and have that Italian charm that will knock your socks off!! It also helps that they know the menu really well and are more than willing to offer suggestions on what you should order. The best thing about Lupa is its affordability. Lupa is another winner by the dynamic duo of Batali and Bastianich."
Such delicious food. Great vibe. People that work there are friendly. I have been here twice and each time was great. I went there once for brunch and had the crab benedict. The second time I had risotto for dinner. Really nothing bad I can say about this place. Everyone that was with me enjoyed the food as well. There can be a wait for brunch on the weekend at times but it is totally worth it.
"This place offers banh mi sandwiches that taste ok, It definitely have room for improvement. Even though the reputation is stellar, I though it was nothing to rave about. I ordered the BBQ pork banh mi sandwich, the pork itself is pretty good, the vegetables tasted more or less fresh. However, the vegetable wasn't chopped enough, a whole piece of cilantro came out with the first bite. The bread was hard and dry, it was suspected that the bread was made a while ago, and been sitting out. So there are ups and downs with the sandwich. It was just $4.50 though, you get what you pay for."
"From start to finish, every aspect of my meal was amazing. Hummus, fried cauliflower , eggplant bruschetta ....wow. Â Their poached eggs was on a piece of rustic toast with scallions, pearl onions and a special orange sauce. The Service was pretty standard, they were there and attentive and that's what counts. Loved the atmosphere. Will be back."
This probably the best sushi I have ever had. It was really great. A few negatives are the atmosphere is a little blah & you pay a pretty penny for the sushi. I actually left hungry but had spent $75 already. These chefs are awesome and make great creations. Would maybe do lunch instead of dinner next time.
"Nice ambiance, solid wine list, food is just so-so. Service is subpar compared to other Danny Meyer places like Union Square Cafe or Gramercy Tavern where the servers seem to have passed a rigorous training in Â hospitality. Dishes read better on the menu than what was brought to the table. We were disappointed."
"Been around to all the greek placed. Â Milos, Avra, Molyvos....all are great, this one though is the only one that doesn't feel like an over done taverna. Â The decor I can only describe as very crisp, same as how to describe the people hanging our at the bar. Not bad for a summer Thursday afternoon in midtown, had the grilled octopus, and short rib yiouvetsi....magically delicious. Â Saw a dessert come out, but didn't try it, next time I'm coming here with a date."
"Favorite place to wind down with a hot cup of soup. Good prices, smooth chowders!"

"it was goood, big portions"
"This is a family run, plainly decorated food find. The cuban food is fantastic. From the beef dishes to the pork and chicken dishes. Do not expect a beautiful, stellar restaurant experience. If you want great authentic cuban food this is the place."
"Been going to Balthazar for the last 10 years. Last visit was brunch and the French toast is divine as are the eggs florentine. It gets crazy, so try to get there before 11am to minimize your wait."
"My friends and i went here on a Friday night. We were seated immediately even though without reservations. Once inside, i was impressed by the decor. The place wasn't too packed and the server was greeted us with a huge smile. We ordered each item on the menu and the waitress also recommended us a few items. They were all very friendly, knowledgable and attentive. Definitely will be back again soon."
"YES YES YES. Â Menu is great, i'm in love with the vegetarian meats at this place. Â love the orange chicken. Â Fair prices good food, what else do you want?"
We went on a week day so it was not too busy. Service was good. Wash rooms clean. Food excellent. I never thought that a watermelon salad could be that good.
"Best Restaurant in NYC, everything is authentic and high quality, I love the Campari Tomatoes they are using, clever choice!"
Great. Â Really low key. Â Strict door policy. Â I love this place and I live close by so it's very easy for me to breeze in. Â Friendly bar staff and great drinks. Â Open late.
"Any restaurant that you can go into at 2 am and get a gourmet meal is fine by me (especially when compared to your other options at this hour)...their fried chicken was amazing, highly recommended, along with the catfish"
"Very expensive, although the produce is not especially fresh. I think the prices are more for the overall ""atmosphere"" of the place, especially for people who are interested in Italy/Europe in general. Since I'm not a fan of Italian or European food, I just found this place to be basically overpriced (though nonetheless very crowded on a Friday night). It is big though. Sells pasta, seafood, kitchen utensils, gelato, etc."
"Went to this place with my wife and two friends. Food options include Tapas. They have a good variety of options. A large selection of cheese. Some options were a bit pricey compared with others. It is on the upper price value in terms of tapas options, some were as high as $16. Portion was as expected, not very large since its tapas."
"Love this place, solid food all around. The food is so good. The fish is so fresh. Â Service is good too. Â My go to place for oysters on the half shell. The price definitely fit the meal, so no complaints there. I would definitely come back here."
"The cocktails at Extra Virgin were great. Â The bartender was so accommodating. Â I would recommend coming for drinks. The system for seating people was a huge disappointment. Â Because they don't take reservations for groups of less than 6, one would think that they would have a good method for seating people as they walk in. Â They kept telling us that there was one party ahead of us while we watched them seat 4 groups of our size. Â The two hosts bickered the entire time we waited. Â When they finally did seat us, the table was rickety and dirty and there was salad under it."
"I come here all the time. They have the best lattes in the neighborhood. Every morsel of food I've ever gotten here in the past 3 years has been delicious, completely delicious."
"The ambiance and dÃ©cor are nice - 4 stars. Food and service are ok - 3 stars. Price is very good; lunch special is a deal. I could give 3.5 stars, but I upgraded a little because this place is a to-go place among all these thai restaurants in 9th avenue, mainly due to dÃ©cor and size. I would give 4 stars comfortably if there was a little bit more personal attention which is hard to find in Thai restaurants in this area."
"Perry Street was a culinary delight. Â I went on a Thursday evening with a friend for Restaurant Week. Â Although the restaurant is situated at the corner of Perry and the West Side Highway, it was well worth the trek. The restaurant is a contemporary romantic atmosphere with enough patrons to keep the place lively. Â There is a pretty much obligatory coat check (that feeling when the hostess asks if you want to check your coat, but she's not really asking you). We were seated relatively quickly and my first impression was that the house Pinot Noir was amazing. Â The courses started coming quickly after that which was the only aspect of the service that I didn't like. Â We were given a butternut squash and parmesan soup to start, this was a little too salty for my liking. Â Next, I had the crab salad (think loose crab cake) which tasted amazingly fresh and was plated with an amazing cream sauce with a kick (maybe cayanne?). Â I'm not a fish person and steak snob, so I was a little disappointed to see that the entree choices were cod and hangar steak. Â However, the hangar steak was cooked perfectly and so tender. Â This was served with a brussels sprouts and a sweet potato puree that was a little unusual but by no means offensive. Â However, the service is so quick that they were taking my plate away before I had even finished my steak. Â The dessert was awesome as well. Â I tried a little bit of miroir au cassis (not even sure what it was) with the pear sorbet and shared the molten chocolate cake with my friend...both were delish! All in all, I would certainly recommend this restaurant for great food and atmosphere but the service needs to slow it down a notch because no one enjoys being rushed through a nice meal."
"Ahhh the beer section of my life! The beer here is just amazing, they have so many to choose from and everything is aligned with the food, they have beer that can spoil you to the brim."
"This is quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood spot. The food is SO DELICIOUS, and is a bit unusual while still being accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences. Brunch is a particular treat, though I almost don't want to admit that because I like that there's rarely a wait for a table... If you go, get the french toast. It's unreal. I also love the grilled kale salad. I've never had anything quite like it but it's just a perfect combination of flavors. I even tried to make it at home but it paled in comparison. Service can be a little slow, but overall it's a great place and a welcome addition to Smith Street."
"Few wine bars are truly enjoyable and this one is 'acceptable.' The outdoor seating is pleasant, have not tried sitting indoors and will not- appears to be oppressive. Small plates are criminally small unless you are on a diet, in which case the portion control is refreshing."
Had a dinner for two here and the food was amazingly delicious! So glad that we decided to try something new. I took off one star because the waiter was a little bit of a dickwad (not attentive) Â but lucky for him the food was outstanding..
"great music, great amtosphere great food , empandas amazing , arroz was good kind of like how my mom made it but still good quality mojitos are amazin !!!! 3rd time goin and i dont think ima stop going !"
"I stumbled upon this postage-sized restaurant with a miniscule kitchen to match. Great food! What it lacks in size (bumped elbows with diners on each side of me) it makes up in quality. Pasta was perfectly prepared with sauces that packed layers fo flavor and the eggplant, for me, was the crowning dish. Fun place to catch a quick bite if you're ambling about in SoHo or the West Village."
At least it wasn't expensive.
"When you talk about places in NYC,you can't ignore Momouns. The place is so special,small Â with a magical vibe. The music just make the rest! And the food.......... what else Â can i said? not much. We all know Momouns. Is my favorite place is your favorite place too!!!"
"Went there with the family last night over dinner and ordered alot of stuff for 4! Was looking forward to the meal as reviews were good, but were a little disappointed with the food at the prices we were paying for. Starters - the garlic prawn sauce was good but the prawns were a little overdone. Redneck clams were amazing though but the waiter got our order wrong at first. Dad and I ordered the X'mas festive set ad the lobster bisque was a little too milky. Lobster main and sea bass main was pretty decent. What annoyed me was that the service wasn't very good - when I ordered the dessert the waiter told me to wait until after we had our courses (how was I to know?) and we had to remind the waiters for our eggnogs. Also, they banged our plates on the table while serving and goofed up on who ate what. Not worth the 20% gratuity charge we had to pay."
I have no choice but to keep coming back for the food cuz its hard to get decent chinese food around here but i keep getting disappointed.........i specifically asked for more garlic/scallion for my order but as they ran out of the chicken leg i wanted they replaced it with a duck leg and left out the sauce. Â the dish is just incomplete without that sauce man.....and i had to walk a distance to go pick it up. Â i called them and asked them for the manager's name cuz i know he's not around at this time (1:44am) but the guy just said come another day and speak to him and hung up on me. Â GREAT SERVICE RECOVERY!! Â  i'm going back there to get to the bottom of this.......
"Yes for the food. Best Greek, hmm. Not sure"
"Meant to be a NYC classic, I unfortunately did not think this was the finest example of NYC's best pizza to an out-of-towner. Â The pizza was good, solid really, but not outstanding. Â It did the trick, and will impress anyone who is from Asia (where good pizza is extremely rare, if non-existent), but the ingredients don't exactly sing and the crust is a bit too thick for my personal tastes. Â Also had a calzone - that was very very filling"
"One of our favorite brunch spots in Brooklyn. Â The food is high quality and amazingly fresh. Â The menu is seasonal and interesting. Â I often dream about the pumpkin/sweet potato soup and the homemade jelly donut. Â The atmosphere is slightly upscale wtihout the pretense. Â  The only downside is that it is so crowded on weekends that you can wait for over an hour for a table, but at least they take your phone number, so you can actually get something else done while you wait."
Not quite as tasty or authentic as normal halal food you get on the street for $5 (including a soda). Very over-rated imo
Can't go wrong with a traditional Italian dinner at Carmine's . The atmosphere is very nice portions are huge and prices are appropriate. Location is wonderful as you are in the heart of the city
We had lunch here on a Friday at about noon. Food is great. This was our second time. My husband had the lamb. I had the shishito peppers which were larger than what I was expecting and a bit more spicy but delicious. We also had an egg and potato dish that was super and filling. Only weird thing was that I ordered the spinach and garbanzo beans and was told that it wasnt available because the spinach just arrived and it wasnt clean? Guess its best they didnt serve it. We both had different types of sangria. Very fresh.
"Terrific sushi, good atmosphere and good service. Not quite as great as Sushi oh Gari, but pretty darn close."
Nice but not great
I love this place. Rolls of paper towels on the benches. 1/2 pints of microbrews. Weighing your massive tray of meat and paying by the pound. I love this place.
This is an update -- My husband loves the chicken and I enjoy the jim cade burger (actually more than the burger at the regular Peaches) but thats it. The menu is super lame outside of the two selections I mentioned above. I never seem to find something that i want on the menu. Unless you are looking for fried chicken then Peaches on Lewis Avenue is a better choice.
it has a very pleasant patio. not an extensive by-the-glass offering.
I am a prisoner when it comes to italian dishes. .. one of the good italian joints in NY. Must try.
"Pick and choose from any number of Korean dishes that are displayed on the counters for easy pickings. Cheap, good portions, and a wide variety make this an instant go-to place for after hour winddowns. Takeout made easyyy."
"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, I would if I could. I went to St. Anselm on a Sunday night around 8ish. There was about a 45 minute wait but this was no problem because we just went next door for a beer. It was one of those nice fall nights we had last week and it was a great way to spend the evening. When we did get to sit down I was very impressed by the menu. I thought it had a great number and variety of options. It was humble but impressive. We decided on the tomato and burrata and a bowl of shishito peppers to start. For our entrees with got the butcher steak med rare and the pork chop medium. I know this is no fault of St. Anselm and totally the fault of US for ordering the shishitos knowing that the whole buzz around the seemingly harmless pepper is that one in a bunch is crazy hot. Well... I've had them before and I've never had a hot one. But this time around my girlfriend bit in to the bad seed. It was maybe her fourth pepper too so the whole bowl was kind of tainted after she spent almost 20 minutes with smoke coming out of her ears and her eyes watering. I mean it wasn't me but she looked pretty uncomfortable. But again, no fault of Anselm. Just... beware if you order the peppers. DO order the burrata though, yum! I mean it's hard to go wrong with creamy mozzarella and a ripe tomato but yum yum. I couldn't get enough. Alongside our entrees we ordered the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The potatoes were good, very latka esque. The spinach was amazing. I was crazy for it. The steak, 5 stars. So good, cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the pork is where I had to knock a star. Don't get me wrong, the meat was cooked outstandingly. And perhaps this is my fault too because on the menu it did say bourbon glazed but I don't think so. This was not bourbon glazed it literally tasted like the chefs just dumped a couple shots of bourbon on top of the chop. The flavor was raw and distracting. It did not compliment the meat, it detracted from it. Yes I will stick with the word distracting. It was very distracting. For desert we ordered the bread pudding. It was just okay. I kind of wish we had opted for the strawberry smore kabob because that looked awesome. The atmosphere was great, service was ok, food was mostly expert and the night was memorable. I would go back and I would recommend it. Very well done."
"A so so place, food was fresh but traditional italian. Will go back only if I have no other options"
Went to Becco last night and was pretty disappointed. The food was OK (had the special halibut) but not worth the crush of people or the unpleasant front of house staff. We bolted our dessert and had to rush to make the curtain.
"I love Uncle Gussy's! The food is oh-so-delicious! No wonder people would not hesitate to line up to buy your food. And at great prices, what more could I ask for? Two thumbs up, and five stars for Uncle Gussy's."
"One day when I was getting my hair done downtown, my hair stylist suggested I try Bianca (being that it was right around the corner). I ended up trying Bianca that day and have returned many times since. Yes, this restaurant is small, a bit loud, and there can be a bit of a wait, but it is wonderful. The cozy atmosphere and buzzing NYC vibe is part of what makes this place so special. The food is delicious and as far as I am concerned VERY inexpensive (especially by NY standards). Some of my favorite dishes are the Pasta e Fagioli, Tagliatelle all a Bolognese, Gnocchi con Formaggio, and the Lasagna (which is made with Bechamel, yum!). I also think that they now serve wine and beer. The only pain is that it is CASH ONLY. If you want delicious, inexpensive Italian food at a cozy restaurant with a GREAT vibe, try this place. It is a gem!"
Warm and inviting. Â This place feels different during the day (like someone's home and backyard) and at night (like a grotto/ european nightclub) - but always intriguing space and welcomes good conversation and great food. Â  The Frozen Cafe Mocha makes me so happy - perfect consistency of icy specks in a tasty coffee concoction. Â The lasagna bolognese is delicious...soupy and tasty - bechemel clearly visible. Â It's perfectly portioned to share. Â Pizzas are also wonderful (though a bit too slippery for my taste) - I recommend the pizza con spek (procciuto). Â  The winter garden is awesome!
"Come here when the weather is warm so you can sit outside. I am obsessed with this place for 2 reasons: -the truffle fries -the Chopped black kale salad Seriously the kale salad made me rethink my previous hatred of kale. It is finely chopped into softened thin strips, topped with gouda and lying in a spicy cream dressing with nuts... sublime and addictive."
"The sandwiches are delicious, the portions are generous, and the pastries delightful; however the service is terrible. The staff is obviously overworked and underpaid, they seem stressed, unorganized, and at sometimes even fearful."
"My friend I went here for dinner. I was a little suspicious because the place is small and not sure if the food is really good. I was totally wrong and don't under estimate the looks of the place because the food is amazing. They have a communal table where everyone can sit and share a table. Kinda kool and nice to make conversations with others as well. We ordered the crispy beef chow mien, duck with chives and green beans with garlic sauce. My friend has been coming here for 10 yrs and I am not disappointed with everything. The portions are just right and the food is just so tasty you want to go back over and over."
"The two stars for the rating doesn't reflect the quality of the food which was good, it reflects the rest of the experience. If you are going to charge $20 for a plate you need to at least not serve Â your water at room temperature or serve seltzer flat ( that's the idea of seltzer it is fizzy not flat) and try serving bread instead of just rushing the food out. Â Please don't suggest foie gras to vegetarians and your choice of music in the early afternoon needs to be a little more appropriate to a restaurant (you should resist the temptation to play gangster rap just because you are in Bed Stuy and have appropriated the locals motto as your name)."
"Great place for a quick meal or steak. I come by here once in a while and am always happy with the food and service. The staff is always friendly and on top of everything. The only thing I would say is avoid going here for dinner on weekdays, its extremely crowded and filled with Wall Street brokers."
"I love ramen. Being a fan of Daikokuya and Orenchi, I wasn't sure how Ippudo would compare, but it blew me away. Went for dinner (around 5pm) and was told the wait would be 30-45min but tt would be faster if we waited inside, so we waited by the bar and the wait ended up only being 20 min! The pork buns were amazing. I wish I ordered five for myself! As for the ramen, the Akamaru Modern was so flavorful and delicious... just writing about it makes me miss it! :9 Slightly pricey for ramen, but hey, it's NYC, and I have to say... you get what you pay for (and it's delicious!)"
"Sometimes you never want to leave your neighborhood to eat, but this is totally worth it. The wine, the food, everything is great. The wine is really unexpected and distinct. The baked clams are off the hook."
"For approximately $15 not including tip and tax for a bowl of ramen, it better be pretty damn good. Â In my opinion, Ippudo's ramen is just alright, of course, it is one of the better ramen places in New York. Â The texture of the noodles is spot on, but the broth could use some help. Â It is not as rich as I would like, lacks body, and has under-developed flavors."
"BURRITOS ~ 10LBs LATER ~ BURRRIIITTTTOOOOSSSS I came to Habana outpost for the first time last week after a long day of service. My team and I were ready to eat something spicy then drink liquor so that our saliva can turn to flames!! It didn't work but we had some great and not semi okay food. Â It was a semi warm day and they have a nice outdoor sitting area. We must have gotten there just in time for the lunch rush because the line was out the building. It took 25 minutes for us to order our food. FYI I am the type of person who offers my food in hopes that you will then offer some of yours so I can taste everyone's food. It usually works. Anyways, I ordered the chicken burrito but everything I tasted was as follows: Guacamole and Queso sandwich, Catfish burrito, cheese quesadilla, Grilled corn, Roscoe on a stick (chicken and waffles), and the frozen Margarita. Now I did not enjoy my chicken burrito. It was way too dry for my liking. The rice had no flavor and I hate the taste of charbroiled meat. Â It is pretty much case closed on that chicken burrito. BUT that catfish burrito!!!! What... That burrito was delish. Idk what it was but it was filled with flavor. I mean I only had a bite (or two) but it gets a thumbs up. The cheese quesadilla and guacamole and queso chicken was tasty but that roscoe on a stick!!!!! I was in love. Now I might be pregnant because I was craving some chicken and waffles and Habana Outpost did Roscoe proud with that side dish. All in all I had a good experience at Habana and would definitely go back. Here's the menu if you want to see everything they have cafehabana.com/data/downâ€¦"
"I tried fried pickles for the first time, and they were delicious (and I don't do fried). Â There was also a higher than average ratio of cute guys to girls (although I'm not sure how many of them were straight - maybe it's because our birthday boy wasn't)."
"Went here last night for the first time. Â This place is all style and no substance. Â I had the mac attack as my entree and overall, it was pretty mediocre. Â The one w/ the truffle oil wasn't bad, but the other two tasted like standard mac & cheese you can get elsewhere. Â I also had the apricot arnold palmer drink and that just tasted like bad lemonade, not at all representative of the description on the menu. Â  And as for service, our waiter was rather snooty and never bothered to check in on us to see how our meals were. Â So Cafeteria is wayyyy overhyped and way overpriced for what you're paying for. Â This place definitely tries too hard to maintain a certain ""attitude"" and tries to be this hip, upscale-ish type of place when it just comes across as pretentious and inauthentic. Â It's hard to believe that people would actually line up to eat at this place. Â Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for better food and service and doesn't try to pretend to be something that it's not."
Good food and impeccable service!
Okay. Â Maybe im just not crazy about meatballs! Â  Its good though.
Not worth the wait.
"Prosperity Dumpling is one of those rare hole in the wall gems of Chinatown. Passing by this place, no one will suspect they have one of the best if not the best dumplings in or around Chinatown unless you notice the line going out the door. There is one and only one reason why I go here and it's for the dumplings. It has great skin thickness, juicy filling and crisp but not burnt skin. This place can pretty much only fit 6-8 people in the store so this is definitely not a sit down and eat place. Get your food and stop by the nearest park on a good day and enjoy the weather and food."
"The place is small so you should get reservations. Food is absolutely AMAZING ! The decor, lighting, and mood were all excellent. Perfect for a date, even. They only have communal-style seating, so it creates opportunities for you to talk to other diners. I will definitely be returning to this little spot."
"Amazing! Must get: corn, Cuban sandwich and grilled shrimp tacos! JalapeÃ±o margarita is amazing too! Very strong! Omg Mexican grilled corn is so amazing!! I don't even like mayonnaise and now I want to recreate this food at home. I got the vegetarian tacos as my main, they were good, but the thought of grilled corn haunted me throughout the meal, even to this day... Cafe Habana is a fun, lively restaurant whose heavenly food more than justifies the long wait and cramped seating options."
"I recommend Gyu-Kaku to anyone that enjoys Japanese food. Gyu-Kaku is a self BBQ place and is a fun experience to share with others. The food, friendly staff and occasional specials that they offer makes the dining experience here always a pleasure."
Ordered delivery and they were extremely prompt! I got the lamb rice and tandoori chicken and it was soooooo good! I ordered extra spicy and they mad it with full of flavor. I highly recommend this place. I reallllllllly enjoy Indian food and this place really satisfied my craving.I love this restaurant !!!
"The cafe and gelato secitons are packed with tourists who take forever to make a decision the grocery section are packed with locals who take forever to make a decision Eataly offers decent and relatively authentic food, but is it worth it fighting the line? I don't think so"
amazing stuff
"This place is amazing - I wish the owners would expand their business to other boroughs in NYC as well as the state of NJ. The Â establishment is city chic and has a cool vibe to it. Â The food is AMAZING and the drinks. especially the mojitos are great ( I HATE mojitos but I enjoy the coconut flavored one from the bar). Â I Â highly recommend the goat cheese empanadas and fried plantains. Â I'd definitely like to return, and may even take advantage of their curbside delivery - Bogota is willing to bring your take out order to your car due to the neighborhoods limited parking spaces."
"Super cozy, sweet place with goooooood, rich food. Their recipes seem to have allot of butter(daaa) and brown sugar. The Rhode Island scallops are very good, so is the warm lamb salad. I heard that the friend chicken was GREAT!"
"We went to Go!Go! Curry for lunch on a weekday. We were hungry and the portion sizes were large. The price was right - very affordable, and the food was good, The menu is somewhat limited, but what they have is pretty tasty. Also, there's not a ton of seating in the restaurant, but there is quick turnover. This is the kind of restaurant you don't spend a lot of time in,but you walk away happy and full."
The meal is fully tasty and the staff service is outclass i am so enjoying and happy with these so nice food stuff specially crockery is so neat and clean.
The combinations Of food Rocco puts together are fantastic.The mascarpone cheese and fish was deliscious.I'm still thinking about the soft shell crabs with tarregon and a little hint of Anise flavor.
"Feel like southern delights? Gotcha, you're at the right place! The Gumbo went down as fast as my finger could do the thumbs-up. Ready for some hot stuff? The Cajun Martini(s) will make you walk up the wall, across the ceiling and back down on the other side... you might just want to stay for a hang-over breakfast and tickle your sore head with the best Bloody Mary in town!"
Finally a new coffee place this modern place is great for mocha and they design a lil artwork on your coffee
Awesome Mexican in the LES. I have been here 4-5 times and everything has been good. I like mixed drinks and they have a ton of tequilas . I recommend the lamb and rice dish. Place is small and has a good vibe. The wait is very long b/c no reservations. Best advice come in a party of 2 any bigger and you will wait 1-2 hours during normal dinner times.
"We stopped in late-night for a drink and some deviled eggs. The eggs were really good - I wish I could have them again, but for brunch. The french fries were matchstick-thin and delicious, with fried garlic and rosemary and LOADS of salt. So much salt, I felt pruney. The place is expensive but I'm told to go back for the burgers. I'll definitely try again as long as the wait isn't too long."
"Food was fresh, Â great taste , price fixe for lunch - great value for the money -includes a drink worth the visit."
"Westville is so cute! I wish they had more outdoor seating but the inside is a Pintrest's dream, even the waitresses look like they're straight out of Pintrest. We went for Brunch/Lunch around 12:30pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The service was really fast and our waitress was really attentive. Their food selection is great and even have a full menu of side veggies. I didn't get to try any but looking around, it looked delicious. The only reason I give it a 4 is because I got the Lox Scramble and it was a little undercooked. Otherwise, everything was great. I recommend getting iced coffee too because it's really good. I would definitely go back."
"Spaghetti Al Limone - so good we should have gotten two of them. It looks simple but it's really amazing. I even converted a friend who doesn't like lemon. Bruschetta- simple but delicious. They grill the bread which is key. The tomatoes are fresh (which in the early winter is hard to find). Just a really nice flavor. TagliatIlle - very hearty, nice flavor. Not as good as the spaghetti al limone"
"I came here early with my Grandson on a Thursday a few weeks ago, around 11/1130. There was no line, and the service was fast. Interesting to see what all of these people have been writing about. I think the pizza was good, but nothing like what all of these critics and people rave about. It's sad, but it seems not too many folks travel these days, or every review would say the same thing - ""nice try to simulate what has been perfected in Italy"". But it was good."
I was pleasantly surprised. Â Cute table. Â Can be loud. Â Good cocktails. Â Curry was tasty.
Great music and service. Delicious eats. Not a fan of the coffee.
"With exotic combinations of too many flavors sometimes the dish gets lost in the ingredients. Innovative or simply gastronomic acrobatics, I'll leave that to someone else to decide. Our table tried a great range of dishes, small medium, large plates as well as desserts. The common denominator was- the flavors become confused and the basic ingredients lost in over sauced, and drowned food. The staff is nice, attentive, courteous, and a bit pretentious. There is talent in this restaurant, but don't hide it under the layers of cream, butter, and salt."
"We had an amazing post Thanksgiving drink here. The staff is very friendly, the place was completely full of candles and made a very cozy environment. We had a glass of wine and decided to order the lamb chops and the burrata with prosciutto. It was delicious!!! We are definitely going back soon, loved this place!"
10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$! 10 dumplings for 2$!
"The setting is a bit too dim for my liking. Not enough lighting which I guess is fine for a bar but for a high-end pizza joint, I'd like a smidgen more light. So my associates and I got a regina (the closest thing to a margherita pizza) and a arugula drenched pie with prosciutto. While both were okay, they didn't wow me. They were actually very underwhelming, even though this place gets rave reviews. The pizzas are about, give or take 11' inches in diameter which is very small and not all that filling between four people. Not all that artisanal compared to all the fancy pizzerias out there but I wanted a good NYC-styled pizza. Instead, I got two tiny pies pretending to be something more akin to Motorino without the puffy dough. Just fancy ingredients trying to cover up for a very depressing dough that failed in every department. Dough can make or break a pie and Paulie fails terribly. So yeah, they were bland at best. Totaling about 31 dollars each, you could do better. That and the pen they gave me didn't work, so I feel they charged me a bit more on the check. Eh. Sorry Paulie, not coming back. Enjoy your mediocre pizza. Also, they're only open at 6 so don't both schlepping to this dead-end of Greenpoint for lunch."
"The artichoke dip is amazing, the lamb is unreal, the wine was great and so was the service. Â I would order something different for my entree next time; I had the scallops and I didn't like the puree they were sitting on and found them lacking seasoning. Â Other than that it was a reasonably priced, wonderful meal."
Excellent tacos. Definitely coming back.
"If I dont eat there once a week then I eat 2 times! best place for drinks, appetizers, main courses, meats.... sushi!!! you name it. they got it all and all in!"
"I went here once with my boyfriend, and it was okay. To be honest I expected way more from here."
"This place is amazing!! the staff is very friendly and always with a smile, i dont care if its fake but it makes u feel welcomed, small portions but it makes up in flavor and freshness LOVE IT!! been there couple of times LOVE LOVE LOVE it."
"In a city with tons of pizza places, this is great. Â Definitely try it."
Very expensive but worth it if you have visited Vienna and really miss the coffee houses there. Â This was the case with us and we were not disappointed. Â The dobostorte and linzertorte were devine and just what we had been longing for!
"Great ramen, definitely tasty, rich broth and perfectly cooked noodles. Yummy pork buns that are very filling. While very tasty, we had to wait 3 hours for a table on a Friday night. I'm glad the food was great but not in a rush for such a long wait again anytime soon! So for me its a once in a while meal. Worth trying for sure."
"I thought I should try this place after hearing about Michael Psilakis being the co-owner and executive chef because he has a very solid background. It did live up to my expectations but didn't necessarily blow me away. I had the sheeps milk dumplings w/tomato, sun-dried tomato, pine nuts, and spicy lamb sausage and it was delicious! The creamy and doughy dumplings played perfectly into the salty sun-dried tomatoes and spicy sausage. Definitely a dish I would order again because it was great and filled me up for less than $15. My mom had the steak with cheese and it was decent but didn't really blow me away (steak was a bit bland). And her bf had the pork loin dish which was VERY flavorful (slightly sweet and salty w/great lemon flavor and red onions which rounded it out) but also VERY small and not filling for $15. I know Greek and most European meals serve their meats by al a carte and then you order your grain as a side but their sure wasn't much meat on the plate. Our sever was extremely knowledgeable and knew exactly what to recommend for us. She was also very attentive and filled waters up promptly which is always nice. However, beware because the place is EXTREMELY noisy and it's challenging to hold a conversation without basically screaming. I don't know if the downstairs was any better but upstairs was very bad........... But if you like authentic Mediterranean food then this place will quench your craving. Didn't get a chance to try their pita bread and tatziki though, both of which I am a huge fan of. Our sever was"
"The food here is quite good. Â Very tasty and expertly prepared. Â I have only good things to say about the meal. Â We started off with the fried oysters and salmon carpaccio; perfect. Â For the main course, my wife had the clams which were amazing, and I had the Thai curry cod; not to be missed. Â The textures were just right, each taste unique. Â  Â  Â It being small wasn't really a problem other than having to wait 20 minutes for a seat. Â We brought our own wine. Â  Â  Two things stopped me from giving this place 5 stars, service and decor. Â  We didn't get any bread while waiting until we asked, and our water wasn't re-filled until the end of the meal. Â  Â  Â  I love the way the place looks and not so snobby that I can't enjoy simplicity, but one wall is decorated with old stuff your half blind grandma would be embarrassed to take out of her attic. Â  Â  But don't let that stop you; eat here."
"Stylish restaurant in a very stylish hotel. Had the tuna tartare, followed by duck with blood orange sauce. My husband had polenta, followed by pork chop. Very fresh, original dishes with great flavours. Our waiter and waitress were incredibly professional, attentive, friendly (but not obtrusive) and I am always impressed when the staff can tell you about the menu in detail as it shows good training and attention to detail as a whole. Wine list was expensive, but this is New York- the Malbec we went for was very nice! Love the setting and atmosphere and hope very much we will visit here again in the future!"
"Rye is the epitome of what Brooklyn foodie's desire in a pub. The old world feel of the interior, dark stained woods, simple back-lit bar, and wooden stools, compliment the classic array of well mixed cocktails. My favorite is the house take on a Dark & Stormy, although their Blood & Smoke is a deeply, delicious surprise. The food is good. At times, tries to be overly refined, but the former chef of Dumont certainly is up to something good. I prefer the bar menu, particularly the braised short-rib sandwich and creamy baked mac n' cheese. This place can get super crowded, so I suggest going on a week night or starting out here early to set the tone for a good evening. Also, the bar tenders are really great, service has always been fine."
Best late night spot - nothing hits the spot more - make sure you try the gyro on rice with tons of white sauce on it - use the spicy sauce moderately as it is VERY spicy. Long lines are expected.
"Nice place - went for dinner and drinks, it was too loud downstairs where we sat but the drinks were good and everyone loved their food. Â Good portions overall enjoyable, friendly staff."
"Everything about this restaurant is perfection! Good food and service, I recommended it !"
Great Atmosphere Great Food Great Service Fun Bar Bring a date!
"I would add that their support of the local art gallery is good, and I like how they update the artwork on their walls on a regular basis."
"I was in the neighborhood with out-of-town guests. We went into a couple of other places on Wythe Avenue, but they didn't appeal. I read reviews of Cafe Mogador, so we decided to give it a try. Just walking in the door made us realize we were in the right place. I had Chicken Tagine with a raisin/onion/cilantro sauce (there were a few sauce options). The lunch special came with soup or salad and couscous or rice. I chose their soup of the day, red lentil. Everything smelled and tasted delicious! The pita bread was hot and tasty."
"Today I had lunch with a girlfriend at Balthazar and am glad to say that it had cemented my fondness for it. The restaurant was possibly even busier that the last time, but we were escorted to our table without much drama. The strategy today was: light first course finished by a decadent dessert. Unfortunately, I could not resist ordering the duck confit (having resolutely decided on a soup only moments ago) while my dining partner was firm on her choice of a frisse salad. While duck confit is a staple of a standard french menu, I had found that not many places do it well. Balthazar however, is smart enough to not complicate the richness of the confit by presenting it cooked simply and well. The confit sat on a bed of juicy sauteed mushrooms, framed by potato crisps tinged with a lick of garlic. While dessert was very good, I was surprised by the modern interpretation of Balthazar's mille fuille. Instead of a flaky puff pastry foundation, the restaurant presented this dessert with two layers of mousse sandwiched by three snaps. One can't help but be swept up by the energy in Balthazar. If I had a choice, I would eat lunch here weekly."
"Fucking terrible experience. Ok, so I'm not the best guy when it comes to Asian food because some of that stuff creeps me out. Â I am not a picky eater, but you just have to tell me what it is so I can eat it. Â That said, I am really not a bad guy to dine with. I burned my face and my tongue from trying their infamous soup buns. Â It's obvious I didn't know how to eat it so I let it cool for awhile before trying it again and it was good and even impressive to some degree. Â But the tongue was already hurting and their feeble attempts to ignore me as I asked for water was already reaching my boiling point. The last draw was when they took my food away and threw the check in my face to where I decided enough was enough. Â I demanded to see the manager when the waiter tried to throw that ""I don't speak English"" bullshit card in my face. Â I eventually saw an older Chinese man who looked like he just woke up and told me that the servers are just doing their job. Â Doing their job to be assholes in a popular restaurant? Â How the hell did they get this kind of business? Â Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe there are many places that serve this kind of food, its called CHINATOWN. I am never coming back here again, but I will give these soupy buns another shot. Â I will need to get some guys from the office to teach me how to eat them properly but fuck Joe's now and forever."
"I'm not a person that usually will wait an hour and a half for a spot in a restaurant but I became a convert for the Spotted Pig. The Spotted Pig is a great date spot and I can see why Piper Chapman on OITNB wanted to pay it a visit on her break from prison. This is definitely where I would want to come. The shoe string fries with Rosemary were amazing. Don't be intimated by the large pile, you will finish them. The burger was mind blowing - juicy and buttery with just the right amount of blue cheese and a perfectly toasted bun. The servers give great beer recommendations to boot! I saved half my burger for dinner the next day and was seriously upset when I realized I forgot to put in into the fridge after returning home in the wee hours of the morning. The memory of the burger was so good that I put serious consideration into whether heating the burger would kill the bacteria that may have flourished over the last ten hours at room temperature but decided I'll just have to make my way back soon. There's a great easy-going outdoor bar around the corner to pass the time while you wait."
Absolutely charming -- a great place to sit and work Â with Â jazz and classical in the background. Â A Â friendly staff. A lovely coffee spot with excellent food.
"Being on my own meant I skipped the queue on a Sunday and ate at the bar. Delicious feta and spinach omelette and fantastic home fries. This is an extremely popular place and I can see why. Even though busy, you are not rushed. Friendly team. Also went Friday early afternoon and sat outside which makes for great people watching."
"Had a great burger here, loved the photo booth in the restroom! Also the bday cake was a nice dessert The other food we ordered was terrific. I got this tuna steak salad and it was huge and full of goodness. Service was nice and we were seated quickly even though there was a mistake (ours) on our reservation. Overall if you're looking for a good place to stuff your face, meet friends, take a few drunken photos in the photo booth, and guarantee good food, The Smith is your place!"
We went here last night and it was shocking. Â The dumplings tasted like they had sugar in them. Â Blech.
We went there 3 times on thanks giving. Regretfully it was closed. No signs tells you its there when closed. We didn't give up. Finally we came on sunday afternoon and found it open. It was worth the effort.
"Their ramen is very mediocre, we are living in place with big Japanese population, we understand how should a really good ramen tastes. Don't stay in a line, it doesn't worth!"
love this place!
nice place
"Excellent Japanese food. I love any of their dishes. If I have to complain, the price is expensive. You should careful to order sake. Some of them are very expensive, however those are expensive sake in Japan too."
The place smells amazing. The meat is amazing. The decor is cool the prices are reasonable. What else can you ask for ???
Obsessed. SOO good and relatively cheap.
yes. Â i certify ippudo the best bowl of ramen in new york.
I love to come here late in the evening or for Sunday Brunch. The food is Excellent!!!
"A great date place! Â The thing to get here is the flammy. Â Super duper thin crust 'pizza' with your choice of toppings. Â We got the jardin with caramelized onions, tomatoes and shrooms with emmental cheese. Â You pick it up like pizza but the flavors are not italian, there is no pizza sauce or mozz cheese. Â I could easily eat one myself, but we wanted desert so we split the jardin along with a green salad so we could also indulge in the banana split flammy. Â the green salad was just ok, the house dressing is delicious but the salad itself was just chopped lettuce with a couple tomato wedges.. Â What I also like about this place is they offer wine by the 1/4l and 1/2l carafe. Â  Overall, La tarte Flambee is a fun tasty place to go. Â They take reservations and I would recommend making one unless you are coming on the early side."
Very noisy but food is tasty and servers are friendly.
"excellent food, fun atmosphere, great service. The seating is super cramped, but that just adds to the charm of the place. It helps that Jehangir is part of the serving crew and very approachable."
"Upon the glowing recommendations of a trusted friend, I sought them out. There were two carts on opposite corners but they had the exact same sign so I figured either was probably OK. I wasn't feeling terribly hungry so I decided on the falafel plate--meat just seemed kind of heavy at that moment. I kind of regretted it, though, because the falafel were not really hot; I think they'd been sitting around a little while, but the flavor was good. Accompanied by the sauces, rice, and salad, which were all great and in generous portions, it ended up being the best bargain I had in NY!"
"Love it. The food was delicious, we were a group of 5, and everyone was super pleased. Shared appetizers, Artichoke salad, love, grilled sardines, love love, Calamari was ok, polenta and mushroom appetizer was amazing. And we had spaghetti carbonara, steak, lasagna... but the best best best dish was the mushroom penne (homemade penne), it was to die for. The ambience is awesome, staff was very attentive... the crowd, uh, not trendy, not very interesting. But go there for the food!"
Innovative. Tired of regular Korean food? Try Jungsik. Good substitute for the now closed Woo Lae Oak in SoHo.
Best sashimi in town
"With an amazing new waitstaff, this restaurant trumps everything on Smith Street. Kudos to the best meal and best service anywhere in the neighborhood!"
"Great food! excellent taste, feels like Singapore or KL... and the portions are large, all for a very decent price. But the services is not great. At all. Well, this is (almost) Chinatown!"
"Hello All, I have been in Locanda many times and I absolutely looove this restaurant!!! They are very busy so servis is not that great, food is delish, but very very small appetizers and they charge a lot of many for it, which I don't care cause is very good, and wine is pretty good for $12 a glass. Everytime I go there I always see some actors and well know people.. I adore this restaurant"
"I love the ambiance, beer selection and the fried pickles. Â  The only thing I don't love is how crowded (and thus, loud) it gets, making it nearly impossible to get in/enjoy yourself on the weekends. Â But I can't in good conscience knock off points for being overly popular. Â Just choose your times wisely and you can still enjoy this fantastic neighborhood bar."
"Large crowd waiting at the door. We thought we'd have to wait for ages and were told that our wait would be about 20 minutes. However we were shown to our table in less than 10. Excellent service staff, excellent food just as good as the ippudo in Kyoto. Wonderful experience."
"Hitting a greek restaurant with a Greek is always dicey but honestly our meal was fantastic. We had the lamb chops and they tasted just like they came from the family taverna. Highly recommend this restaurant - ensure you make reso's as it's always busy. Break out and try the wine from Greece - honestly their wine list has some great bottles. Portions are large, so hold yourself back , you want to ensure that you save room for dessert!"
"This is definitely my favorite spot to order Sicilian Pizza Pies and Spumoni. No matter where I go, I always crave this pizza and would often drive to Brooklyn from NJ just to order a few pies. The pizza is constructed differently than most square pies - the sauce is placed on top of the layer of mozzarella Â cheese (the cheese is placed directly on top of the thick pizza crust, topped with home made marinara sauce, with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese). I also highly recommend trying spumoni if you've never had it here before - it consists of pistaccio, chocolate and vanilla/hazlenut flavor with hazelnut bits. Â  During the summer time, the lines for the pizza and spumoni are often long but it's definitely worth the wait. If you have someone else dining with you during the summer, I suggest one of you grab a Â bench - this place can get crazy crowded. Â There's also a restaurant component on the premises called the Pasta House which serves traditional Italian style dishes. Be prepared to deal with tons of double parked cars, and a full lot. I promise you that all of that will be well worth it."
"The lamb lollies are one of my favorite ""splurge"" dinners in Astoria. They are a bit pricey, but totally worth it. I also love coming to this place because the owner/chef always comes around to say hello. The environment is also very relaxing (although some of the tables are a bit cramped together). I can't say I've ordered anything else from the menu, though, because I always am craving the lamb lollies! Yum!"
So a girlfriend and I decided to get on yelp and search for a good Pho placeto have lunch and here we found Saigon Shack.. So as we arrived there there was a line so we asked the lady who seem to be handling the seating with a list how long will the wait be and she looked at us with a mean dirty look and said 15 minutes and walked away.. so we waited for her to reuurn to put our names down on the list and boy was she rude.. then we asked her for a menu to look at so we can explore the menu. she looked at us and looked away without a word and never returned with a menu for us.. Lady with that kind of attitude we left.. find another job if you are not happy with theone you have. too bad we did not get to try the food but the food is probably just as good as that nasty lady there.. will not be back
"Being a huge fan of Italian food I always try to find new awesome spots in the city! And recently I found Piccoli Trattoria Place! The food is fantastically delicious in there! Ravioli with mascarpone cream, grilled Â calamari, all kinds of pasta, desserts, breads and gourmet wines - everything's on a top! Great service as well! I'll definitely going back there again soon!"
I ordered barbecue ribs and roasted ducks. They are both small plates for 12 dollars. I would say they the dishes were good. The ribs' meat fell off the bones while dish artistically presented. Nonetheless they were not exceptional. I would say unique design but not gastronomically wonderful for the price.
Pretty amazing! Â You got to love an old school place like this. Â Well worth the wait!
"They may be rude but the food is so good. It is best to avoid the barbecue items late at night. It is better to catch it during the day. Cheap + good food + open till late at night. Can't ask for me and makes me a regular to Noodle town after partying. The egg noodles, roast pork on rice, roast duck on rice, beef in egg sauce-- all these are very good. Try the noodle soups as well. My favorite: Salt baked shrimp. Those salt baked shrimps with the hot sauce on side are the best stuff you can have after one too many drinks! One can try the salt baked combo as well. The portions are just right and the food is just so tasty you want to go back over and over."
i like the drinks and the food. I will go back
I'm so happy we stopped to eat lunch here. I didn't even know this place existed until I tasted their food...wow! It was definitely a hit with me. Will be back for more...soon!!!
"We were pleased to find a huge variety of selections that are all advertised on large wall signs. There are all types of sandwiches from Paninis to hot, wraps, grilled and specialty types (I had the Cuban). They also have burgers, omelettes, salads, smoothies and pastries. Something for every taste. Prices were very reasonable, service was quick, quality excellent. There are bathrooms available in the building's hallway, just ask to use the key for access."
